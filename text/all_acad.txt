Still less would anyone be likely to think of the " open mind " that way . But such was precisely the image that seemed to govern a series of events at Princeton University this past year , which culminated in the dismissal of one of the official Catholic chaplains. 1 <p> C. John McCloskey is a young priest who belongs to Opus Dei ( the Work of God ) , a mixed lay-clerical organization founded in Spain in the 1920s with branches throughout the Catholic world . Opus Dei prides itself on its loyalty to the pope and its rigorous spiritual discipline . Some of its members were active in the Franco government in Spain , and the group has often been accused of having a conservative political ideology . Officially , Opus Dei states that it has no political position as such but that its members are free to engage in political activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opus Dei members are known to be politically active . <p> The group has for years been in the habit of establishing houses near elite universities , and seems to recruit new members primarily from such environments . ( There are degrees of affiliation , some of which are relatively loose . ) The group was active at Princeton as early as 1987 , and in 1989 it purchased a house just off campus to serve as its local headquarters . The purchase alarmed some Princetonians , indicating as it did that the organization intended to become a permanent presence at the university . <p> Almost from the beginning , rumors about the group and its alleged hidden agenda were circulated in both Catholic and non-Catholic circles in the community . Among liberal Catholics , Opus Dei has an image somewhat like that of the Masons in earlier times -- a malign secret organization with controlling tentacles moving in all directions . Little of this has ever been documented and , whatever the group may do in other parts of the world , it is clear that in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal piety . <p> From 1970 to 1988 the official Catholic chaplain at Princeton was Father Charles Weiser , a Trenton diocesan priest who directed the Aquinas Foundation . This organization is Princeton 's equivalent of the Newman Clubs elsewhere , and has its headquarters in a house once occupied by Thomas Mann . Weiser was appointed by the bishop of Trenton and was officially recognized by the university . By his own account , Weiser was at first cool to Opus Dei , and he describes his early encounters with McCloskey as less than friendly . Eventually however , he made the decision to appoint McCloskey an assistant director of the Aquinas Foundation , as much as anything , according to Weiser , " to keep an eye on him . " 2 <p> Shortly afterwards Weiser terminated official relations with another assistant chaplain , Jesuit Father Robert Ferrick , because of disagreements over Aquinas Foundation policies . Rather than accept Weiser 's policies , Ferrick left Princeton , but his departure caused a good deal of bitterness among his campus admirers . <p> Running through the dispute over Opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is revealing that Ferrick 's most ardent admirers , who attended a weekly midnight Mass he celebrated , referred to themselves as " the Druids . " One of them , the left-wing journalist Gloria Emerson , noted : " Something remarkable must have been going on to get a Jewish undergraduate , a Puerto Rican methodist sic , and an agnostic together for a Catholic worship service . " 3 Ferrick himself , in his farewell message , listed his constituency as " Druids , chapel colleagues , black and Latino friends , those concerned with alcohol and drug abuse , the harassed , the marginal , the foreigner . " 4 Notably absent from the list were those he had been appointed primarily to serve : traditional Catholics . <p> Ferrick 's departure was the occasion for the first public attacks on Opus Dei , attacks notable for the fact that , in one of the major scholarly communities in the United States , they were made without any felt need to offer proof , not even to define terms . Thus Walter Murphy , a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Opus Dei had " Fascist ties . " 5 The closest Opus Dei 's critics ever came to offering proof of their charges of a malign hidden agenda was a frequent citing of the book The People of God : The Struggle for World Catholicism ( Viking , 1989 ) , by the late left-wing journalist Penny Lernoux , which claims that Opus Dei has been involved in various right-wing movements in Latin America . Lernoux was hardly a disinterested scholar , and Opus Dei officials pointed out that the organization had won a libel suit against her in a West German court . Her book , however , was cited over and over again as irrefutable evidence of Opus Dei 's sinister nature . <p> This alarm was fueled , within a community that prides itself on openness and rationality , by almost unlimited attention in both the campus and the community press to all the group 's critics , frequently citing the same people saying the same things over and over again . For a while no mention of Opus Dei in Princeton failed to recall that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman found murdered in the basement , despite the fact that this information had absolutely no bearing on the controversy . <p> For some months before the McCloskey case came to a boil , the press related how some Princeton Catholics were " worried " about the organization and its possible intentions , calling it " cult-like " and possessing a " right-wing reputation . " 6 Murphy alleged that Opus Dei had particularly " targeted " Ivy League universities , a charge which , if true , merely proved that it accepts those institutions ' own evaluation of their worth . Weiser , initially unsympathetic to Opus Dei , observed with some irony the behavior of highly rational academics : <p> The guy ( McCloskey ) was coming down here three times a week and people are paralyzed by anxiety . The immediate feeling I had was that they were acting like an elephant jumping on a chair trying to get away from a mouse . People were afraid Opus Dei was going to take over. 7 <p> Critics of McCloskey studiously avoided one inconvenient fact -- students and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was by no means clear that his critics outnumbered his supporters . The critics claimed , with considerable vehemence , that McCloskey 's approach to religion was inherently offensive and oppressive and , in case that fact was not known widely enough , gave it maximum publicity . But , if that was so , it seemed to follow that in a highly sophisticated community like Princeton , McCloskey 's approach would have little success and he would in time be forced to withdraw . What really bothered his critics , which for obvious reasons they could not admit , was that intelligent people , including undergraduates , did find his message attractive . The critics ' task , then , was to save such people from themselves . <p> The most vocal critic was an undergraduate named Robert Taliercio , a member of the left-wing religious group Pax Christi ( the Peace of Christ ) , who was one of those constantly referring to Opus Dei 's supposed " right-wing " political ties . Taliercio claimed to have attended an Opus Dei program in Spain one summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members lived in " very luxurious " surroundings. 8 If living in opulence is grounds for condemnation , it might be supposed that many Princeton students themselves would have to be damned . However , for all the talk about " right-wing " political ideology , no Princeton critic of Opus Dei ever reported any direct experience of this . No one claimed that McCloskey tried to influence his political views , or to recruit him into any kind of political activity , even on such identifiably " Catholic " issues as abortion . <p> Instead , a small number of students reported that they had been offended by McCloskey 's approach to what the Catholic Church calls " spirituality " or personal religious discipline . Some undergraduates ( no more than a half dozen were ever identified ) complained that he was " overly negative , " " rigid , " and " censorious , " which turned out to mean that he placed a good deal of emphasis on personal sin , warned students to avoid certain " occasions of sin , " and suggested that the larger world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely classical Christian doctrine ( once taught at Princeton and other Protestant schools ) and , if it is indeed unattractive to modern Americans , the problem , again , would have been self-correcting -- McCloskey would simply have failed in his mission . Thus critics were forced once more to avoid the central issue : that in a truly " pluralistic " environment Catholics were free to accept or reject McCloskey 's advice as they saw fit . Instead , they had to go through remarkable contortions to conceal the fact that they simply wanted church and university authorities to suppress an individual whose views they found personally distasteful . <p> Some attempt was made to imply that McCloskey had engaged in improper actions , such as a female student 's claim that he questioned her in the confessional about her sexual activities. 9 Allegedly , these improprieties had been reported to university authorities . The nadir of yellow journalism in the case was reached by the Trenton Times , which reported that evidence of these actions had been given to " university sources , who prefer to remain anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action against them . " 10 The Times thus found it possible to insinuate serious improprieties on McCloskey 's part , to offer no proof , to claim that the evidence existed but was being suppressed , and to charge that the university had been intimidated by Opus Dei . ( If the university did indeed keep the complaints confidential for fear of legal action , a logical assumption might be that the complaints were unfounded and would not withstand scrutiny . ) <p> Unable to state frankly that they sought to suppress McCloskey 's opinions simply because they found them offensive , his critics next fell back on a relatively narrow point -- that he should not be allowed to represent the Aquinas Foundation , since it would officially associate the Catholic Church with his own allegedly distorted theology . But it was the prerogative of the foundation 's director , and ultimately of the bishop of Trenton , to decide who could enjoy official status in the chaplaincy . Weiser later stated that he had investigated every complaint against McCloskey and found no improprieties , even though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The logic of the critics ' position was that no one who could be viewed as " controversial " ought to be given official status by the foundation , a contention they would hardly have defended under other circumstances ( Father Ferrick had also been highly controversial ) . A priest who , for example , might have offended some people by passionately supporting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua would in all likelihood be dubbed a " prophet " and praised for his courage . <p> The nub of the issue was half-consciously expressed by Taliercio when he accused Opus Dei of trying to " stamp out those who do not agree . " 11 But McCloskey was not demanding the expulsion from the Aquinas Foundation of those who did not support his views ; rather the reverse was the case . In effect his critics ' position was , " Opus Dei wants to suppress disagreement , so we have to suppress it first . " It was the dilemma of modern liberalism in a nutshell : is " tolerant pluralism " either tolerant or pluralistic enough to tolerate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " tolerating " only those whose views are like its own ? <p> Taliercio said that he had originally been attracted to Opus Dei because " it provided security and it makes complicated lives very simple . Everything is black and white . You do n't have to think . " 12 It was a curious confession for an Ivy League student to make , prompting , as it did , the obvious question , " If you were so easily manipulated then , how do you know that you are really ' thinking ' right now ? " But it was also necessary to justify the exercise in liberal censorship -- those who accept the Opus Dei position allegedly do not do so with full freedom and understanding , and must be protected by those who know better . <p> In December 1989 , Suzi Landolphi , a professional comedienne , performed a routine at Princeton designed to promote both " safe sex " and feminism , which included such things as pulling a male student in front of a video camera , ordering him to say " vaginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got caught in your throat . " She also had female students stretch condoms over male students ' heads as a means of " desensitizing " the audience to contraceptives . McCloskey subsequently published a letter in the Daily Princetonian , the official campus newspaper , objecting that Landolphi viewed students as " salivating animals without any capacity for self-control . " 13 One student responded in a letter by accusing McCloskey of trying once more to " enslave " women with " the holy bond of matrimony " and of " keeping them barefoot , pregnant and in the kitchen , " an illogical charge given the fact that McCloskey was preaching chastity . The student concluded by suggesting that " perhaps the Princeton community . and society at large should advise McCloskey to take to drinking nothing but the semen of AIDS patients . " 14 <p> Earlier , McCloskey 's critics had met with the new director of the Aquinas Foundation , a Trenton diocesan priest named Vincent Keane , to demand McCloskey 's removal . Keane , who remained publicly noncommital , let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using the foundation 's name in his letter . <p> Following the " semen " letter it might have been thought that at least some of McCloskey 's critics would begin to wonder whether the tone of the debate was sinking lower than was proper for an elite university , but there is no evidence that they were embarrassed by such rhetoric . In some ways the essence of the matter was stated by another student letter-writer , who explicitly denied that Opus Dei was entitled to the toleration of a " pluralistic , open society " on the grounds that " their agenda is to establish a universal hegemonic view . " The writer concluded . " In a plural , liberal democracy , McCloskey is allowed to spread his AIDS : Assault on Inquiry , Discourses , and Speech . But we have our contraceptives : open minds . " 15 The Landolphi incident revealed most clearly that the real opposition to Opus Dei , therefore , was not over its alleged " right-wing " political ties , but over sexual " liberation , " and McCloskey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because he dared to disagree publicly with current conventional wisdom . Intellectual freedom was explicitly described as a " contraceptive , " the purpose of which is to exclude consideration of unfashionable views . <p> That sexual orthodoxy was the root of the tension between McCloskey and some in the Princeton community was confirmed when the G. K. Chesterton Society sponsored a talk by Maggie Gallagher , the author of a book arguing that women have been exploited by the sexual revolution . Gallagher faced a partially hostile audience , which at one point pelted the stage with condoms . A feminist student published a review of the speech which stopped just short of saying that Gallagher should have been barred from campus , arguing that she appeared under false pretenses , since she failed to acknowledge that she supported " patriarchy. " 16 The Chesterton Society was then accused of being an Opus Dei front organization founded to give the group unmerited intellectual respectability , although members pointed out that only some of them were affiliated with Opus Dei . <p> McCloskey 's defenders soon found themselves in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth yet another barrage of attacks , which widened to include not only McCloskey but any student who dared to defend him . The techniques were classic McCarthyism : ceaselessly repeated charges offered without proof , unsubstantiated claims often by unnamed people , hints about confidential evidence which was being suppressed . Opus Dei found itself in the impossible situation of having to say , in effect , over and over again : " We are not a cult . " <p> McCloskey 's critics repeatedly criticized the Aquinas Foundation and the university for not investigating their charges . But Luis Tellez , head of Opus Dei 's Princeton house , pointed out that no one had ever filed a formal complaint against McCloskey with the university authorities , which would have resulted in an investigation in which McCloskey could have defended himself . The critics ' weapon was primarily an unceasing propaganda barrage , and they seem to have calculated ( correctly , as it turned out ) , that such an assault would eventually achieve their goal without the obligation of having to prove their charges in any rigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning matters of sexual behavior , the critics began claiming that he had warned students against taking particular courses and prohibited them from reading particular books , and that Opus Dei members themselves are forbidden to read certain works . They therefore asserted that McCloskey 's approach to education was fundamentally at odds with the nature of the university . McCloskey , in turn , claimed that the allegations were untrue or highly distorted . The only " smoking gun " the critics could find , which they attempted to establish as the murder weapon , was a memo from the priest listing about forty " courses of possible interest from a Christian culture viewpoint at Princeton University . " 17 The list was drawn directly from the university catalogue and included nine academic departments , its net cast wide enough to include both " The Religion of Islam " and " The Origins of Modern Science . " Criticism centered on a note appended to the list : " Remember everything depends on the outlook of the teacher giving the course . The latter may seem quite interesting and stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact is counter-productive . " This warning , critics trumpeted , was censorship of the worst kind and in violation of the very nature of free inquiry . <p> But no critic even alleged that McCloskey 's list omitted courses that should have been included , which would have been the obvious way of " censoring " courses the priest thought unacceptable , and on the face of it the list was a recommendation , not a condemnation . McCloskey gave no indication which courses , if any , he considered " anti-Christian , " and his warning was no different from the kind feminists and militant ethnic minorities issue all the time on university campuses . Thus critics were in the position to assert that McCloskey had no right to evaluate university courses , no matter how mildly or obliquely , a curious understanding of the nature of free inquiry . <p> At the end of last March , six students circulated an open letter to the Princeton community accusing McCloskey of using the tactics of " intimidation " and claiming that his presence on campus was detrimental to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names appended to the list , not all of them Catholics . ( Although McCloskey 's critics portrayed him as fostering ignorance , in contrast to those like themselves who valued knowledge , their publicity was consistently marred by elementary errors . Thus , on their petition the name of the historian Carl Schorske was spelled " Scherske , " and one student claimed that McCloskey had warned her against reading " Bertram " Russell . ) <p> Tellez issued a detailed response to the petition , mentioning , among other things , the libel suit against Penny Lernoux and the fact that no formal complaint against McCloskey had been lodged with the university ; he also said that certain statements attributed to McCloskey were not authentic . McCloskey 's defenders were at a constant disadvantage , however , since his critics used each defense merely as an occasion to mount the same charges even more aggressively , a tactic which both the university and the community press were more than willing to permit . <p> Keane , who had met with twenty people demanding McCloskey 's ouster , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " no right " to warn students about " anti-Christian " courses. 19 Keane cited his own experience as a college professor ( of speech pathology ) to justify his judgment , apparently an act of professional solidarity with professors for whom freedom includes immunity from criticism . The Daily Princetonian , after giving McCloskey 's critics maximum publicity for months , now formally sided with those critics in an editorial decreeing that the " Opus Dei group should be allowed to preserve its religious identity -- but only to the extent that its practices do not intrude upon the university 's academic mission . " 20 Both this statement and Keane 's seemed to imply that academic freedom includes professors ' immunity from " outside " criticism . The Princetonian 's formula also seemed to imply that Opus Dei 's preservation of its religious identity is a privilege granted by the university . <p> In April , Keane announced that McCloskey would not be returning to the Aquinas Foundation in the fall , a decision McCloskey said had been conveyed to him in December , the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately nine hundred Catholic students on campus had signed the petition against him , and categorically denied their charges . The Princetonian article announcing his dismissal was a comedy of errors which scarcely bolstered the claim that McCloskey 's critics represented responsible scholarship . Keane appeared to be advocating affirmative action for Hawaiians when he was quoted as saying that he hoped to replace McCloskey with a " lei woman , " and the student paper identified Keane 's photograph as McCloskey 's , giving rise to a deliciously wicked fantasy on the part of McCloskey 's supporters , that of posting copies of the paper all over campus with the notation , " This man has been officially found to be dangerous to students . If you see him on campus , detain him and call the police . " <p> Now , even the claim by McCloskey 's critics that the issue was the relatively narrow one of whether he ought to be officially associated with the Aquinas Foundation was belied when , following the announcement of his " non-renewal , " they continued to press for a university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air the same charges against him . <p> Keane 's action in surrendering to McCloskey 's critics was curious in part because of their increasingly frank agenda . One student writing for the Princetonian accepted Opus Dei 's claim to loyalty to the pope but asserted that " good Catholics " need pay no attention to him. 21 One leader of the anti-McCloskey faction , who published a lengthy attack against him , signed a pro-abortion advertisement in the Princetonian. 22 However , when Weiser wrote a letter to the newspaper arguing that McCloskey had been mistreated , it was not published . ( The letter later appeared in a conservative student publication , the Princeton Sentinel , in a summary of the case in which several of the students who signed the petition against McCloskey admitted that they never met him and had signed at the urging of their friends. ) 23 <p> McCloskey and Opus Dei intend to remain active in Princeton , and McCloskey has said that his exclusion from the Aquinas Foundation might actually make his work easier . The pastor of St. Paul 's Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board member of the Aquinas Foundation who said he was not consulted about McCloskey 's removal , has commented : " It seems that a little orthodoxy scares a lot of people . " 24 Princeton University itself seems to bear little responsibility for what happened to the priest . There is no evidence that the university sought his removal , although the few officials who spoke publicly mildly criticized McCloskey . Primary responsibility rests with Keane , who appears to have decided simply to buy peace . Even if every single charge against McCloskey were true , his comments and actions were within the bounds of what is usually defined as academic freedom . Ironically , in the future , those in the Princeton community . inclined to think that Catholic officials fail to respect this freedom have only to look at the treatment accorded John McCloskey to find prime evidence for their thesis . <p> 
##4000351 Section : REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> -- Alexander Pope <p> My association with the English department at Duke University began in 1971 . Having taken my bachelor 's and master 's degrees at the University of Tennessee , I was looking for a place to study for the doctorate , and was interested in a change in academic scenery . As I considered various programs , Duke University kept surfacing as a particularly attractive choice . It was small , but not too small ; it had educated two of my best undergraduate professors ; its library was spectacularly fine ; and with its gothic architectural splendor and lush gardens it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen . Furthermore , in my English studies thus far , I had often found Duke scholars such as Allan Gilbert on Dante and the Renaissance , Benjamin Boyce on eighteenth-century culture , Newman I. White on Shelley , and Lionel Stevenson , C. R. Sanders , and Paull F. Baum on Victorian literature particularly valuable . Their work was thorough , serious , and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new and worthwhile . <p> I entered the doctoral program at Duke , concentrating primarily on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English literature ; and after taking my Ph.D . in 1975 , moved on to the University of Rochester as an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow . Thus began a career that has taken me to a number of institutions , given me a chance to write , teach , and chair ( for perhaps too many years ) an English department , and generally has allowed me to experience the kinds of ups and downs usually associated with an academic career . Through it all , I found that my training at Duke served me well . Duke could not , of course , strike brilliance from such ordinary stuff as I , but it did give me a thorough grounding in the English language and English literary history , and an exposure to a very broad range of English , American , and " world " literature . It also instilled in me the sense that however important " the profession " and my own career might be to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and culture were much more so , and moreover , quite transcended in significance the relatively small world of American academic life . <p> After 1975 I had little contact with affairs at Duke . Then , in the fall of 1983 , I received a Duke University English Newsletter , a publication promising to be the first in an " on-going semi-annual enterprise to keep alumni and friends of the Department up to date on what 's going on in the Department . " My first , perhaps naive , response was one of at least mild pleasure . Learning about the goings-on in one 's old graduate program seemed innocent enough , though I do remember thinking that the rather slickly produced publication seemed just a bit vulgar and out of key with the Duke I had known . In my time , self-advertisement was viewed with something like disdain , and we graduate students joked that the classic departmental recommendation was the one-sentence statement that a given candidate was " not without redeeming virtue . " Well , this chirpy little newsletter was a far cry from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole inoffensive . It listed the current departmental faculty , with a paragraph about each professor 's background and publications . At the end of this section , however , I came bolt upon the following : <p> We hope that it is our humanness , as well as our professional achievements , that will come to the fore in future issues of the Newsletter -- enough so , at least , to make you want to read about who and what we are , what we do , what we think , and even what we 're like when we are outside the hallowed halls of academe . <p> Perhaps I was too sensitive , but this statement positively jarred . Just what did they mean by " humanness " ? I was certainly far from convinced that , whatever it might be , it could be communicated in a six-page newsletter . Suspecting them of cant , I thought they rather expected more interest in them personally than was warranted . <p> If I detected something self-serving and self-important in that statement , some of my fears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " successful " " Duke Writers ' Conference " was discussed , which " attracted national attention " ( apparently a mention in the New York Times ) , held " rigorous workshops , " and created a " rich environment . " Another item noted a ( predictably ) " successful " Association of Departments of English meeting held at Duke having " virtues other than statistical " and featuring papers " exhibiting gratifying qualifies of mutual admiration . " It was concluded that " the most fortunate departments are those at small , private universities " -- like Duke , no doubt . The issue closed with the revelation that the Ph.D . no longer required " historical distribution . " Now each program would be " shaped by the individual student , " and Ph.D . courses " spoke more directly to the students ' courses of concentrated study , " and were " extremely popular . " <p> Here , I began to see two features that would become all too characteristic of subsequent issues : an emphasis on publicity as opposed to intellectual value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department 's favor . The newsletter , I would soon realize , seldom reported anything without first assuring the reader it was " excellent , " " successful , " " the best , " or " important . " This left the unsettling impression that self-congratulation , publicity-seeking , and a very dubious curricular " freedom " had become the order of the day . <p> The Spring 1984 issue contained a rather bland section on the journals published by the department . Although it focused a bit heavily on the great distinction of these journals , the rest of this issue was informative and relatively modest . <p> When Fall 1984 arrived , I was gratified by the long lead article on the great Carlyle Letters project . This undertaking , begun by C. R. Sanders in the sixties , is a genuinely important work of literary scholarship -- arguably the finest ever done at Duke . A lengthy piece followed , however , on a new department member , Prof. Frank Lentricchia , who seemed an odd choice for Duke . He was himself a 1966 Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon in my time . Furthermore , his recent work had focused on highly theoretical , contemporary , political , and rather narrowly professional subjects . After the New Criticism ( 1980 ) , his most notable book , achieved great success due , I suspect , to the hope of many bewildered scholars that it would help them make sense of the opaque , jargon-ridden wastes of " contemporary theory . " At one point , Prof. Lentricchia tossed a crumb in the direction of Duke 's past commitment to historical literary scholarship , but it was clear to anyone familiar with his work that his loyalties lay elsewhere and that a department comprised of Lentricchia and others like him would be unlikely to produce another Carlyle Letters project . Indeed , his appearance on the scene strongly suggested that an idea of scholarship was beginning to obtain that was less catholic , literary , balanced , and disinterested than I had known . <p> My suspicions were increased by another piece on the new undergraduate English major , which , it was said , would now concentrate on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A student " interested primarily in the history of the novel " could now mainly take courses related to that interest ; requirements based on historical , literary " periods " would be largely scrapped . Lest readers consider this approach flimsy , ahistorical , overly specialized , or irresponsible , the Newsletter assured us that students were required to take a course on a major author ( Chaucer , Shakespeare , or Milton ) . How one course on Milton would make much sense to an undergraduate largely read in the " history of the novel " the Newsletter did not indicate . My fears about the Duke of 1984 crystallized when the piece concluded with the following example of English prose : " As students recognize the excellence of an English major to later experience , both personal and professional , we hope to see increased interest in our courses continue . " It was a use of " excellence " with which I was unfamiliar . <p> The Spring 1985 Newsletter , on first blush , brought little bad news . But , in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Eliot , and Robert Penn Warren , there was an incoherent and largely incomprehensible piece by Prof. Gerald Monsman on his application of Derrida 's " deconstructive possibilities " to Walter Pater and ( of all people ) Charles Lamb : <p> I pointed out that for Pater ... there is no privileged source of meaning within the text -- not the author 's life , not the fate of his characters , not the text 's intellectual precursors , not the increments appended to it by the reader-critic -- but rather , that each component generates alternative possibilities of meaning because the imagery of the text contains within itself multiple , contradictory echoes . <p> This passage left me with three reflections : first , that this might -- given de-constructionist assumptions -- be applied to any writer ; second , that Prof. Monsman 's prose had benefited little from his study of Pater ; and , third , that this was a rather ominous straw in the wind regarding the English department . <p> I was at least right about the third reflection . In further reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by a fragmented , " **29;54;TOOLONG " affair involving seven different courses , each doing its " own thing , " taught by faculty from every manner of department , and presided over by a resident " composition theorist . " The crowning touch was that each freshman would choose which course best suited him . <p> This latest revelation regarding program " reform " brought everything into focus . Whether freshman , senior major , or Ph.D . candidate , each student was to do whatever was right in his own eyes . Any concept of common expectations , experience , and bodies of knowledge , as well as a meaningful core curriculum , was clearly becoming a rare bird at Duke . It then dawned on me that without all these , not only students , but professors also would be blissfully free to pursue merely their own specialized interests . This insight would prove useful in " deconstructing " later newsletters . <p> Looking back I see that the first four issues were merely preparatory . Their self-congratulation , self-advertisement , general complacency , justification of questionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prelude to the grand announcement in the Fall 1985 issue that Stanley Fish was coming to Duke , as was his wife and fellow theorist Jane Tompkins . It was also noted , though rather parenthetically , that Fredric Jameson , America 's " foremost Marxist critic , " would soon grace the halls of Duke . <p> Clearly , something big was afoot . We had been told that the emperor was being fitted for a set of magnificent new clothes , and now the attendants were arriving with the complete line . Just what Prof. Fish 's impending presence signified was evident : <p> In accord with his resistance to orthodoxies and impetus to change , Fish feels that the greatest excitement in literary studies today is in feminist studies because of the " unwillingness to stop at any boundary real and imagined . " He notes that the " revisionary energy " of literary studies currently rests in feminist studies . <p> Prof. Tompkins , in an accompanying piece , described her view of literature as " a form of political power , " her " suspiciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary works that do " social work . " She indicated that as a " populist and feminist critic " she " likes to say that ' the road from Uncle Tom 's Cabin leads to The Valley of the Dolls . ' " Even to a reader of limited insight , it was evident that Prof. Lentricchia and Prof. Monsman were but humble John-the-Baptists to the true prophets . Those prophets had now arrived -- and with a new gospel . <p> The precise nature of that gospel became brilliantly clear in succeeding issues . Anything concerning traditional literary study , literary history , " the canon " -- literature per se -- was out , or at least deeply suspect . Contemporary " theory , " postmodernism , " pop culture , " " political approaches , " " gay studies , " " feminist studies , " and " the New Historicism " ( with its Marxist assumptions ) were the " new Duke . " Despite the seeming diversity of these approaches , their essential sameness was quickly revealed in the newsletter -- though such revelations could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . " When , for instance , Prof. Fish was quoted in the Fall 1988 issue as saying : " Once you have subtracted from the accidents of class , race , gender , and political circumstance , what is it that you have left ? " it was perfectly in character . <p> The sorts of preoccupations and limitations implicit in Prof. Fish 's question quickly came to shape almost everything in the department , and this was mirrored in the Newsletter . Thus in the Spring 1986 issue , it was announced that " nonperiod specialization " would be the new emphasis at Duke . Such shifts in focus require new faculty , bringing to Duke Marianna Torgorvnick , a " cultural critic " and Jane Gaines , a " media critic . " The piece on Prof. Gaines was particularly interesting . At one point , she indulged in the sort of logic becoming quite common at Duke : " I have argued that film studies belongs in English departments because this strange presence ... better answers ... the question , ' What is literature ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close study of those texts which are not considered literature . " Maintaining that people in " film and television studies ... must find every manifestation of mass culture significant , " she went on to assure the reader that such scholarship is quite respectable : " Now Duke can move ahead with assurance because media studies has established its theoretical pedigree . Academic study of film and television is respectably aligned with the most sophisticated French theories . " No doubt . <p> The Fall 1986 newsletter heralded the hiring of another " couple " : Professors Annabel and Lee Patterson were the result of " another impressive year of recruiting . " It was made clear that the Pattersons were linked not only in marriage , but also in their " commitment " to the " political " study of literature . Annabel Patterson specifically affiliated herself with the " reaction against the reaction against political history . " Readers would perhaps have liked to ask whose political history , but that would be frowned upon , and besides , we are all expected to know the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Duke . The first was a lecture by Prof. Fish on the " irrelevance of theory for practice in sports , literary studies , and the profession of judging . Examples came from legal texts , newspaper articles , and the career of former Baltimore Oriole pitcher Dennis Martinez . " The second ( not totally unrelated , perhaps ) involved the graduate English program : no longer were specific requirements needed to ensure the coverage of historical periods of literature , and comprehensive examinations would cease to be comprehensive and , instead , focus on " a major area . " Further , the foreign language requirement would also be closely tied to the " major area . " It occurred tome that with every reiterated claim of greater diversity and range at Duke , the actual literary and linguistic horizons of its students seemed to narrow . <p> The next three newsletters focused on continued hiring and the kind of " scholarly " activity characteristic of the new Duke . The Fall 1987 issue announced the acquisition of Barbara Herrnstein Smith , who apologized for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself as " always having been a theorist . " Prof. Smith 's major contribution to " theory " is that all values are " radically contingent . " Also noted was the arrival of some younger academics , including Regina Schwartz , who combined study of the Bible with ( what else ? ) contemporary theory , Michael Moses , whose main concerns were South American fiction and literary studies " within the context of political philosophy , " and Michael Moon , who combined the " New Historicism " and " gay studies . " I then read of John Clum 's several essays on homosexuality , Leigh Deneef 's deconstruction of Thomas Traherne , and Joseph Porter 's explorations of " postfeminist tragedy " in Shakespeare . The highlight of the issue , however , was its list of " visiting professors , " among them a Marxist , a feminist , and " a television theorist with a special interest in soap opera . " <p> Spring 1988 stands out for its coy protest that , despite recent " newspaper accounts , " the English department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , it was asserted that the " classics are taught and abundantly , " offering as proof the fact that English majors were required to take a course on either Shakespeare , Chaucer , or Milton . What more could one ask ? <p> What really gets taught at Duke was perhaps more candidly revealed in the Fall 1988 issue . New hires were again noted , and the stars featured were Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick , who was quoted as observing that " if the work does n't have a strong political thrust , I do n't see how it matters . " Such a charge can hardly be leveled against her . Her work centers on " male sexuality , " " central oppressions " in our culture , and " the AIDS epidemic . " What literature Prof. Sedgwick addresses in this worthy scholarship was not revealed , though the 1989-90 newsletter published the titles of two of her papers : " How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay " and " Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl . " Apparently the classics are not dead at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose interests include " contemporary , marginal literatures . " Despite his brave commitment to the contemporary , he lamented his students ' lack of historical perspective : " The literature of the 60 's and 70 's is ancient history . These are people who first came to social awareness in 1980 if not 1984 . " Compensations , however , do exist for Prof. Ferraro . He is delighted to be in a department , he noted , in which The Godfather is deemed a masterpiece . <p> The latest newsletter ( 1989-90 ) continues to tell the good news about hiring , and we read that Duke has a new star in black studies , two new feminist theorists , and -- my favorite -- a specialist in " daily life . " This learned person is particularly interested in the scholarly contemplation of " aerobics , shopping malls , Barbie dolls , Michael Jackson , and Mickey Mouse . " I do n't know that we should be very surprised that the department 's new Mickey Mouse authority comes to Duke after an appointment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California at Santa Cruz . <p> As tempting as it is to close on this sublime bit of bathos , I really can not do so , for despite its rich comic value , the " new English " at Duke is not finally funny . If $100,000-a-year professors at one of America 's most expensive and " elitist " schools want to posture as good comrades , populists , and the vanguard of class struggle , probably no lasting harm is done -- to them . There are undoubtedly , however , students at Duke who would like to study literature . What they are actually studying is made all too clear in two of the most recent Newsletters . It is noted that Duke graduate students have given a number of papers lately . And what are we to suppose were their topics ? Some tides are indicative : " From Screwballs to Cheeseballs : Comic Narrative and Ideology from Frank Capra to Rob Reiner , " " Fear and Loathing in the Literary Canon . " " The Gynecology of the Closet in The Changeling , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gender Paradigm , " and " Kierkegaard , Marxism , and Post-structuralism . " <p> This list is to me inexpressibly sad . Not only is the dreary sameness of the assumptions and preoccupations depressing , but completely or almost completely absent is any sign that the authors of these " works " have had any real exposure to the rich , beautiful , endlessly fascinating , and genuinely " liberating " fullness ( " canonical " and " noncanonical " ) of English and American literature from Anglo-Saxon times to our own . In the final analysis , it is not so much what the Duke English department actually does that matters -- as silly as much of it is -- rather , it is their painful and ultimately absurd desertion of literature as a great human art , and as a great instrument of culture in the Arnoldian sense , that condemns them . <p> By Phillip B.

##4000352 Section : POINT OF VIEW <p> Should the curriculum include more humanities ? Many thoughtful people think so . They argue that the humanities are needed to help us get back in touch with our essential humanity , regain our moral insight , recover our sense of values , return to our cultural roots , and restore our political traditions. 1 Like the humanities themselves , this argument is inspirational but vague ; and because it is vague , it is dangerous . It leaves many questions unanswered , and this leaves room for people to answer these questions in ways we might not like . <p> Here are some of the questions that need answering . What , exactly , are the " humanities " ? Which courses in humanities will students be required to take ? Why should these courses be preferred to those they will replace ? Who will teach these courses , and whose humanity , moral insight , values , culture , and tradition will they advance ? How will these courses be taught ? I believe that these and similar questions must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether requiring more humanities is a good idea or a bad one . The Vagueness of the Idea of the Humanities <p> If anything can safely be said about this subject , it is that the term humanities is not well defined . Consider the list of courses that will satisfy the humanities requirement in my own university 's so-called core curriculum. 2 This list , which is typical , contains just under a hundred items and is still growing . In addition to the usual courses in literature , classics , history , anthropology , philosophy , and religion , there are also courses in art , music ( both jazz and classical ) , dance , American studies , women 's studies , Latin American studies , communications , political science , speech , film , etc . This is a very heterogeneous and divergent lot . These courses may have what the philosopher Wittgenstein called family resemblance , meaning that A has eyes like B , who has a nose like C , but there is almost certainly no way in which they all resemble each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , but that it is too diffuse . No one could object to the richness of choice if it served a clear and coherent educational purpose , but , if it does , who can say what that is ? Certainly not I. Each of these courses may have its value , but the value is different in each case . There does not seem to be anything that all of them have in common . So , there does not seem to be any reason to group them all together and require every student to take one or more . <p> It is sometimes said that the humanities all have in common a concern with values . Accordingly , courses in art and literature treat of things that embody aesthetic values , and courses in feminism or Marxism treat of economic , political , and moral values . Yes , but every human activity , including science and engineering , either treats of or embodies values . Thus , the social sciences treat of values in discussing human behavior , and the physical sciences embody values by preferring evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclusive possession of the humanities . <p> We could , of course , try to limit the humanities to particular sorts of values . For example , we could try limiting them to aesthetic values . The humanities would then include nothing but courses in art , music , and literature . Women 's studies and communications would be left out . Yes , but also left out would be the first two parts of Northrop Frye 's famous triad of humanities : philosophy , history , and literature . Why not then simply limit the humanities to Frye 's triad ? Because that would leave nothing out . Philosophy , history , and literature are universal media ; they cover everything . So , once you 've included them , you 've included everything else , too . <p> We could leave out the arts if we limited the humanities to moral values , but we would then have to include women 's studies , black studies , economics , politics , and so on . In fact , social science would now comprise most of the humanities -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires . <p> Evidently , it is hard to find a characterization of " the humanities " that will limit them to a short and well-defined list of things . In fact , every choice is arbitrary . Although no single principle , rule , or definition determines what counts among " the humanities , " there is a perfectly good explanation and justification for every item on virtually everybody 's list . Humanities Has Added New Meaning with Each Age <p> Why this is so will become evident after we review the history of the concept of the humanities . As this history reveals , the word humanities is a chameleon which has changed its color to suit every age and ideology . In consequence , it has not one well-defined meaning but many different , if overlapping , meanings . <p> So far as I have been able to discover , the idea of the humanities originated in the Renaissance , when scholars tired of medieval theology and other-worldliness distinguished literae humaniores , writings about things human in scale , from literae divinae , writing about things divine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given over to God and the church , most of the down-to-earth writings were in classical Latin or Greek . Therefore , the first humanists were classicists , lovers and scholars of classical literature . More generally , they were admirers of things classical , devotees of classical ( i.e. , Greek and Roman ) literature , art , and culture . <p> Present use of the term humanities still retains some of its original meaning ; but the term has also acquired a very different connotation , one that is in some ways broader , in other ways narrower . <p> First , the broader connotation . Where medieval theology had been dry and logical , the classics were elegant and charming . So , the adjective humanistic soon came to connote not just the subject but also the style of the writing . In fact , style eventually counted for more that content . Whether the writing was about man or God ceased to matter very much ; what mattered was whether it was refined or florid . Hence , humanities now more often denotes what the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all , human or divine . <p> Once this extension of usage came into existence , a still further extension was soon to follow . If what made literature humanistic was its refinement or elegance , then the same could be said of all art , whether literary or not . Accordingly , humanities has come to denote not just poems and stories but all refined art , including painting , music , sculpture , film , and the like . As a result , humanistic now means arty -- in other words , refined , cultivated , and effete . <p> This broadening of the term to include all of the refined arts has been accompanied by a compensating narrowing . In the Renaissance , humanists prized classical discussions of science . One of the greatest discoveries of humanist scholars was a copy of Lucretius ' poem On the Nature of Things , which made known to modem scientists the atomic theory of matter first formulated by Democritus of classical Greece . Also of interest to Renaissance humanists were Roman writings on engineering , governmental administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt the factual , analytical manner of the medieval scholastics , science and technology ceased to count as humanistic . In fact , both science and its technological applications came to be regarded as the embodiment of all things that were not humanistic . C. P. Snow 's " two cultures " came into being , as science became antihumanistic and humanists became antiscientific . <p> The exclusion of things scientific was completed in the nineteenth century , when the German romantics distinguished what they called Geistewissenschaffen , studies of the spirit , from what they called Naturwissenschaffen , studies of the physical world. 4 Believing that a human being is essentially a spiritual , not a physical , being , the Germans reinterpreted the humanities as inspirational studies , the main purpose of which was to influence not the intellect but the will and the emotions . This made theology , which had originally been the very opposite of a humanistic study , into the most important such study . It also meant that science was now formally excluded from the humanities by virtue of its content as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had flowed from science . Accordingly , humanistic now meant things ornamental , inspirational , and cultivated but unscientific and impractical. 5 <p> In summary , the word humanities originally meant the naturalistic writings , then the naturalistic art , of classical Greece and Rome . Later , it signified any form of refined art or writing , and then any form of art or writing that is edifying , inspirational , or entertaining but not analytical , informative , or utilitarian . At one time or another , therefore , humanities has denoted just about anything anybody cares to mention . <p> Given this history , it is no wonder that lists of " the humanities " are so lengthy and diffuse . One might desire to prune these lists , but there is no obvious and principled way to do it . In the history of the term humanities one can find a justification for every item on the list . So , whether he likes it or not , a friend of " the humanities " is committed to them all . The Diverse Values of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse and divergent collection of things ? The customary answer is , again , one that mentions " values . " We teach the humanities , it is said , in order to teach our pupils a sense of aesthetic , moral , political , economic , or intellectual values . Let us now examine this answer . <p> Obviously , it owes a lot to the romantic conception of the humanities . In that conception , the humanities are inspirational rather than scientific studies ; their main function , as the romantics themselves emphasized , is to cultivate not the intellect but the passions and the will . In other words , their business is to inculcate us with certain moral and aesthetic values . Where the sciences teach facts and logic , the humanities are to teach feelings , obligations , and taste . Where the sciences teach us how the world is , the humanities teach us what it ought to be . Where the sciences endeavor to understand the world , the humanities aspire to take the right attitude towards it and make efforts to improve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is questionable because it leaves out the social sciences , which deal with both facts and values , and overlooks the fact that natural science embodies and teaches the values inherent in a preference for reason and truth . However , let us overlook these difficulties . For the sake of the discussion , let us grant the distinction . How does it help ? <p> So far as I can see , it does not . Here is why : once the topic of values has been raised , we inevitably face the question , " Whose values ? Mine or yours ? " You like Mozart ; I like Monk . Who will we teach our students to like ? You prefer Matisse : I prefer Grandma Moses . Who will we teach our students to prefer ? Jones favors feminism , Smith , a strong family . Which will we teach our students to favor ? Sarah believes in free enterprise , Sam , in socialist equality . Which will we teach our students to believe in ? <p> To some people , the answer will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prefer what is beautiful to what is ugly , what is good to what is bad , what is true to what is false , and so on . Unfortunately , these abstract terms -- truth , beauty , justice , goodness , etc. -- conceal great intellectual and practical problems . Who gets to decide what is to count as true , beautiful , just , or good ? You , I , or somebody else ? <p> This is no problem where you and I , who share essentially the same values , are designing a curriculum for a private school or university supported by voluntary contributions and attended by people who wish to be taught what we wish to teach them . Designing a curriculum for a public school or university , however , presents a moral difficulty . This arises from the fact that it is contrary to the principles of a free society to compel citizens to pay taxes to support the teaching of values that can not be reconciled with their own consciences and interests ; and it is doubly onerous to compel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public schools are nobody 's private property . They do not belong to any group to do with as it pleases . Rather , they are the property of all who must pay the taxes that support them or submit their children to their tutelage . What Are Our Choices ? <p> What then should we do ? The answer , I think , lies in giving up the idea of using the schools to teach students " values " per se , and insisting instead that they be taught skills . In particular , we can insist they be taught the intellectual skills that used to be known as the liberal arts . I believe that , in the process of learning these valuable skills , students will also automatically acquire some of the most important values , namely , respect for discipline , hard work , reason , truth , honesty , excellence , achievement , civility , etc . There will be no need or room for indoctrination . <p> These remarks will puzzle some readers . It is generally believed that the humanities and the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , it will seem inconsistent to praise the one while condemning the other . It is also widely believed that the main business of teaching the humanities is to refine the tastes and improve the morality and politics of our pupils . So , it will seem self-contradictory to reject doing this while recommending training for citizenship . How the Liberal Arts Differ from the Humanities <p> To resolve these paradoxes , I must now explain how the liberal arts differ from the humanities and why teaching the skills necessary for good citizenship can escape the temptation to engage in political or moral indoctrination . <p> The idea of the liberal arts was invented by the ancient Romans , to whom the word arts meant " skills " and the word liberal signified " free . " Accordingly , the great Roman writers Cicero and Seneca explained that the liberal arts were the intellectual skills needed by free men -- as opposed to the menial skills needed by slaves . Among the liberal arts as thus understood were the skills of calculating , reasoning , reading , writing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and prerogative , as citizens , to participate in making or approving policy for the republic . In short , the liberal arts were the skills needed for free and effective citizenship . <p> The term liberal arts retained this rich and complex meaning throughout the Middle Ages . In the typical medieval university , the basic studies were the seven artes liberales , which comprised the trivium of logic , grammar , and rhetoric and the quadrivium of arithmetic , geometry , astronomy , and music ( i.e. , poetry ) . Higher education involved the study of more esoteric subjects : revealed philosophy ( i.e. , theology ) , natural philosophy ( i.e. , science ) , and moral philosophy ( i.e. , ethics ) . Anyone who went through this curriculum got a liberal education , one fitting him not to earn a living or enrich himself at a particular occupation , but to fulfill his public responsibilities as a citizen . He could read , write , and reason at a very high level of proficiency . <p> It should now be clear that the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the concept of the liberal arts is far better defined . Second , the liberal arts are skills whereas the humanities are subjects . Third , mathematics is one of the most important of the liberal arts , but it is positively excluded by the romantic conception of the humanities . Fourth , although they are intellectual rather than occupational skills , the liberal arts are useful rather than ornamental , utilitarian rather than inspirational ; unlike the humanities as they are presently conceived , the liberal arts can not be equated with the refined arts . Finally , there is no antagonism between the liberal arts and either science or technology . Teaching the Liberal Arts Should Be Our First Priority <p> My contention , broadly stated , is that we ought to concern ourselves first with instruction in the liberal arts . We should make the teaching of the subjects embodied in the humanities , and in the social or natural sciences , a goal of secondary importance to the inculcation of intellectual skill . <p> The reasons are obvious . Everybody needs these skills , but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own experience as a college teacher confirms , students these days can not read or write or calculate , much less reason effectively . I know from personal experience that we are now graduating with B.A. and B.S. degrees people who can not write grammatical sentences , read and understand paragraphs , calculate simple percentages , or compose a coherently formulated argument -- things many eighth graders could do fifty years ago . This is shocking , it is shameful , and it desperately needs to be corrected . <p> But we are not going to correct it if we continue to fight over whose values to teach . Instead , we shall just distract attention from what truly and most urgently needs to be done , namely , restoring to our students the capacity to reason seriously . <p> The task may seem insuperable , but if we attempt it we have one thing going for us : it is , in fact , an objective that virtually everybody , whatever his political or religious convictions , can support -- because virtually everyone will benefit from its realization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts -- as much of them as we can get . So , anybody with any sense wants to be able to read and write at as high a level of proficiency as his abilities will allow . <p> For this reason alone , instruction in the liberal arts ought to be one of the main tasks of public education in a free society . Training people in the refined arts ought to come second . So should training in the occupational or vocational arts , as well as training in moral , religious , and political values . <p> Please note that nothing in this proposal either rules out teaching the humanities , the social sciences , or any other subject or denigrates the importance of exposing students to rival values and views of life . It just requires that these be taught with an eye to increasing the student 's level of literacy , numeracy , and general powers of reason . What better way to teach students to read and think than by doing it through Plato , the Bible , Shakespeare , Jefferson , Marx , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take courses which are aimed at influencing their attitudes and conduct , but not at raising their level of intellectual skill . <p> Unfortunately , humanities courses do not always satisfy this standard . In a passionate and eloquent essay on the topic , writer and former teacher Ellen Ashdown has pointed out that many humanities courses in the public junior colleges are designed not to raise the level of student literacy but to accommodate the illiterate student. 7 Such courses use books with lots of pictures in them , and rather than teaching the student to read or write they rub a little high culture off on him while collecting his fees . <p> The universities have little cause to feel superior . To see why not , consider English and history , the two most popular fields in the humanities . When taught correctly , they are excellent vehicles for inculcating the liberal arts ; but they are not always taught in the right way . Teaching the liberal arts is labor-intensive ; it takes time. 8 Professors in the public universities have far too many students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , as William Arrowsmith pointed out long ago , the professors of English generally leave the teaching of literacy to their graduate students , to whom they teach literature. 9 The professors of history do something similar . They teach great masses of students names and dates in mind-numbing survey courses while graduate students mark the papers . This is not the fault of the professors , who are often doing as best they can under difficult circumstances ; but it nonetheless needs to be corrected . Until it is corrected , we can not automatically expect students to learn the liberal arts from studying English and history . Conclusion <p> The moral of the story is this : an argument can be made for requiring students ( especially in the public schools ) to study courses -- whether in the humanities or not -- when these are taught with a eye to inculcating the liberal arts , the basic intellectual skills that every citizen requires . Little argument can be made , however , for increased study of the humanities where this will have the result of substituting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic skills of the intellect ; and no argument at all in support of using the humanities to indoctrinate students in the moral , religious , or political values of any group . <p> It will be objected that teaching people to read , write , calculate , and reason is the business of the grammar and the high schools ; and so it is . But I believe that the colleges and universities should also teach these skills , albeit at a higher level . Furthermore , the debate over which level should do it is academic . At the moment , neither the grade schools nor the institutions of higher education are teaching the liberal arts . They must both go back to doing so . For reasons that the ancient Romans understood well but we have somehow managed to forget , our preservation as a republic of free citizens may depend on it . <p> This brings us back to politics . As these last remarks suggest , the purpose of teaching the liberal arts is political ; but it is political in the broadest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competency in the liberal arts is good for the whole political order and everybody in it . Emphasizing the primacy of the liberal arts is , however , certainly not political in the narrow and bad but popular sense of that word : the liberal arts are not partisan ; they do n't favor the program of this political party over that one ; they do n't advance one group 's interests at the expense of another 's . Rather , possessing the liberal arts enables every group to advance its own interests and , thereby , the well-being of the whole . <p> 
##4000357 On 5 April 1990 , the New York Times reported that Dr. Joel Segall , president of Baruch College of the City University of New York , was resigning from his job , following a critical review by the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges . There was no allegation that Baruch was anything less than an excellent college . In fact , it is widely regarded as one of the four top business colleges in the country and trains almost one out of every three of the certified public accountants working in New York . Rather , the complaint was that there were not enough " minorities " in the faculty and administration and that not enough " minorities " graduated . Disturbing though this is , even more unsettling is the fact that the criticism was concocted by the central offices of the accrediting agency , acting independently of its own guidelines and evaluation team . <p> While it contained some criticisms of Baruch 's curriculum , the public report issued by the evaluation team itself was on the whole quite positive . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning ethnic tensions and the lack of minorities on the faculty . The report did not state that accreditation was to be withheld or deferred because of these matters . ) According to procedure commonly followed in accreditation , Baruch was given an opportunity to submit a statement answering the criticisms in the team 's report . Following the college 's response , a still confidential letter from Sarah Blandshei , the chair of the Middle States Association , is said to have indicated that accreditation would be " deferred " because of the " minority " attrition rate and the lack of " minorities " in the administration and faculty . <p> Dr. Howard L. Simmons , executive director of the Middle States Association , acknowledges that under his leadership , the agency has undertaken a new activist role . He has asserted , according to a recent issue of Black Issues in Higher Education , that all universities must be made responsible for the success of " minorities " in higher education. 1 In order to do this , Simmons said in an interview , the faculty and administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student body . " 2 This is part of a broad initiative by Simmons . According to published reports , fifteen to twenty other institutions have also been threatened on these grounds by the association ; Baruch 's is only the first case to become public . <p> The attack on Segall and the Baruch faculty represents an ominous direction taken by accreditation . For the first time , an accrediting agency is criticizing the ethnic composition of a college 's graduating class , as well as making specific complaints about the racial makeup of its faculty and staff . According to a source on the Department of Education 's National Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility , such a step is entirely unprecedented . No other accrediting agency has ever undertaken an aggressive role in attempting to impose racial quotas on faculty , administrators , and graduates . <p> In itself , the attempt to control the ethnicity of university personnel is nothing new . In the last twenty years , the concept of affirmative action has evolved into a quota system in which white males are routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in the American Scholar. 3 Although deeply threatening to the integrity of the university because they undermine the concept of professional peer review , quotas imposed on personnel committees have been a long time aborning , and it does not appear that they will be easily abolished . Until recently , however , the federal government was the principal agency in this coercion . Now , it appears , the effort has shifted from government to private agencies such as Middle States , accompanied by the notion that henceforth a college may have its accreditation withheld if it does not graduate the right percentages of certain ethnic groups . A Racial Graduation Quota ? <p> When asked if a college could be found delinquent for failing to graduate sufficient numbers of " minority " students , Simmons agreed that Middle States does use an " outcomes-based approach " for granting or withholding its approval . He denied that Middle States has any " hard and fast rules " regarding minority retention rates , indicating there is " never a single standard " in assessing a school 's performance in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education : Standards for Accreditation , the handbook used by Middle States . In fact , there is no statement whatsoever in that manual concerning minority retention rates . When this was pointed out , Simmons changed his mind and said that accreditation is granted or withheld on a case-by-case basis . " I know that sounds hard to understand , " he admitted , " but that 's how they do it . The team decides differently for each school . " There are " so many factors involved " that there can be " no quantitative standards " for evaluating a college . So much for the objective criteria of accreditation . <p> What is particularly bizarre about Simmon 's line of reasoning is the fact that students at Baruch , regardless of racial and ethnic identity , generally have a much better chance of graduating than elsewhere . Of white freshmen at Baruch , 48 percent graduate in four years , compared to a national average of 40 percent ; 37 percent of black freshman graduate in four years , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate in four years , compared to 42 percent nationwide. 4 ( Only " Hispanics , " a particularly heterogeneous group whose actual composition varies greatly by region , do slightly less well -- 31 percent at Baruch and 35 percent nationwide . ) <p> Apparently , not only have the criteria for " minority retention " been invented for the occasion by Middle States headquarters , but the true numbers have been ignored . It is likely that the criteria are kept deliberately vague in order to increase the arbitrary power of the accreditors . The use of an unstated but de facto racial graduation quota puts university administrators in a vulnerable position , since there is no way to tell whether Middle States will charge them with not having satisfied the goal of graduating sufficient numbers of designated minority groups . The lack of precision permits Middle States to deny that they are seeking any exact outcome , thereby avoiding legal action . At the same time , when it suits them they can use the " outcomes-based approach " as a potential threat to colleges seeking accreditation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real racial graduation quota , residents and deans will be inclined to design programs to increase graduation prospects for protected groups . <p> Middle States can thus obtain the desired outcome without ever having to invoke the threat explicitly , and all the while remain protected from public scrutiny . Simmons admits having adopted the same tactic with many other institutions , but because of the secrecy involved in the accreditation process , he has not had to be held publicly accountable . However , in this he may have violated federal regulations . The Department of Education has criteria for recognition of accrediting agencies , one being that an agency " not mislead the public " regarding an " institution 's or program 's educational effectiveness . " 5 Can Whites Teach Blacks , and Vice Versa ? <p> The other criticism leveled against Baruch is that is does not employ enough " minorities . " In reality , this argument is absurd , since many Baruch professors are Jewish and non-white Asians . But in education-speak , such individuals are not defined as " minorities . " Middle States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Hispanic whites and not enough blacks for a student body that includes many blacks and Hispanics . Thus , the broader question at issue is whether or not white instructors can adequately teach " minority " students . The " diversity " of a student body , according to Middle States , must be matched by a corresponding " diversity " of faculty and administrators . This belief is so widespread amongst academic administrative cognoscenti that few question it . When the logic of such a concept is challenged , the usual response is that a white professor can not be as good a " role model " for a black student as a black professor . <p> In fact , there is little or no systematic evidence for this argument . In social psychology , the notion of " role model " is correctly applied to the basic socialization of children , when explaining how in childhood we " identify " with others , particularly parents , siblings , and peers , and choose certain persons ( particularly those of the same sex ) on whom to model ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be as likely to " de-identify " or want to be the opposite of a peer or a sibling or a parent . It is also highly questionable whether this process takes place after puberty . At most , therefore , while one may suggest that professors can serve as inspirational mentors to college students , no evidence exists that such individuals must be of the same sex , race , or cultural background . The idea of " role model , " in short , is fraudulently applied in the field of higher education . <p> Indeed , if such a concept did make sense , it would have exactly the opposite results of what Middle States ostensibly desires . It would mean not only that black students should be counseled to take courses only from black professors , but also that white students should not take courses from black professors . If black students need black professors as role models to spur them to greater levels of achievement , white students require and deserve the same kind of encouragement . Taken to its logical conclusion , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial segregation in higher education . If black students respond best to black professors , they ought to maximize their chances by enrolling at all-black colleges . The same would apply , mutatis mutandis , to white students . <p> Another justification for the use of racial quotas in hiring is the suggestion that white professors are somehow harder on black students . As closet , or unconscious , racists , white faculty are , according to this argument , responsible for the higher dropout rate of blacks . In point of fact , there is no evidence for greater white professorial bias against black students . Dr. June O'Neill , a former member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and professor at Baruch 's Center for Business and Government , has done extensive research on the determinants of black and white high school students ' achievements when they are young adults . Black students who have black teachers tend to do less well in terms of verbal aptitude , but this is because black faculty tend to be less well prepared . By itself , a teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is doubtful , however , that Simmons and his allies are inspired by evidence or logic . There is no reason to believe that much reflection was done on the scientific basis for their criticisms and suggestions . Rather than call for measures that will actually improve the quality of education at the institutions they investigate , they seek symbolic moves that produce positive media images . Future Implications of Accreditation Quotas <p> In the classic accreditation process , institutions are evaluated on the basis of the stringency or laxity of their educational standards . In the past , if a college was found to be too lax , accreditation was withheld , or perhaps conditionally granted pending correction of certain deficiencies . But now , for the first time , a college 's accreditation has been " deferred , " not because its standards are too low , but because they are too high . An institution of higher learning is being directed to arrange its faculty , administration , and curriculum so that a de facto racial graduation quota can be filled . Aside from some serious issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of institutional autonomy and faculty control over the hiring process . <p> It is no coincidence that this new and arbitrary direction has been taken by a private accrediting agency . In 1989 the Supreme Court issued a series of decisions that seriously undermined the ability of government to require institutions to use racial and sexual quotas in hiring and promotions . Though this was a serious setback for those who would like to see a political system governed by racial and sexual entitlement , they have evidently regrouped . <p> For example , under the sponsorship of Senators Kennedy and Hawkins , the Civil Rights Bill of 1990 currently being argued in Congress would reimpose on employers the burden of proving that they did not discriminate against minorities in hiring . Since it is virtually impossible to prove that something has not occured , the result will be that employers ( including colleges and universities ) will be obliged to adopt quotas in hiring in order to forestall potential lawsuits . This is particularly likely because the same legislation will require employers to pay the cost of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination free of charge . <p> On the level of academic rhetoric , the tactic has been to substitute " diversity " for the now-tainted " affirmative action , " since it is widely recognized that the latter has produced discriminatory preferential hiring . Surveys show that most blacks , as well as most whites , are opposed to preferential treatment for blacks . Using " diversity " sounds better because the term is vague and it is hard to say one is against it . But the Baruch case shows what " diversity " truly means ; it is simply old wine in new bottles . <p> That there is no logical or empirical justification for racial quotas in hiring or graduation should not need saying . But Simmons and his allies are not governed by logic or facts ; they are driven by a sense of moral righteousness that is impervious to any argument . Rather than conforming to consistent and objective standards of excellence , Simmons makes up the rules as he goes along . Rather than appealing to the intellect , Simmons tugs at people 's basest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . <p> 
##4000358 Recently I read a fine article by Prof. Walter Berns , called " The Core as an Education for Natural Aristocrats " ( see Academic Questions , Summer 1989 ) . It 's a Jeffersonian idea and I agree with it , but for some reason I find that I spend much more time worrying about that oxymoron , the natural bourgeoisie , than about any kind of aristocracy , natural or conventional . <p> It 's true that students at liberal arts colleges , even in Ohio , have a kind of aristocratic assurance that their lives will be successful , and that they will do important things in the world . Also , they tend to enjoy something of the high-minded innocence of the well-reared and protected which encourages them to love learning for its own sake rather than for material utility . But , to belabor the obvious , above all they are creatures of liberal democracy and , as such , irredeemably bourgeois . They pretend to be relativists but are really believers in rights and individual responsibility . Underneath the high-toned moralism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives they will lead when they graduate will overwhelmingly be bourgeois lives , composed of the usual professional and commercial careers , condominiums , divorces , therapies , and retirements . <p> Of course , not only do liberal educators know this , but on the whole it drives them wild . As we all know , by and large liberal arts professors belong to that strain of the bourgeoisie which dislikes itself ; hence the really powerful intellectual movements on contemporary campuses are all characterized by bourgeois-bashing . What holds " humanistic , " i.e. , aesthetic , Nietzschean Marxism together is hatred of the human products of commercial republics . Feminism , which in the larger society has strong elements that are irreproachably bourgeois ( wages , equality , self-fulfillment ) , in the prestigious universities is magnetized to utopian , antibourgeois speculations about overcoming the " tyranny " of gender or " patriarchy . " Deconstruction , despite , and indeed because of its air of a political cool , mocks the square epistemological naivete of workaday life . The crusade against the dominance of " Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to something really exotic , and thus to destroy their bourgeois complacency . Pedagogical politics is thoroughly antibourgeois , whether it is engaged in purifying democracy of its bourgeois taint or creating idealists who are to work for a better nonbourgeois and perhaps nonliberal world . <p> Yet there is something paradoxical and self-defeating to the point of comedy in the way this all works out . To understand this , one has to remember why the bourgeois got such a bad reputation in the first place . This is not self-evident . In certain passages Adam Smith , for example , glorifies the honesty , straightforwardness and independence of the bourgeois . Where the courtly spaniel fawns and begs for a bone of patronage , the manly bourgeois plunks his hard-earned money down and " trucks " for his wherewithal . There are still some students like this , mostly economics majors , who simply can not be made to feel guilty about maximizing their utilities . Still , most of the students I see resemble the bourgeoisie Rousseau denounces and Moliere lampoons , a bourgeoisie intimidated by aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgeois is a creature of cities , but not really a citizen , just a lover of private life , peace , and commerce . Alienated from his original human nature as a happy , sappy , witless beast , he has not achieved a coherent second nature . That is why " the natural bourgeoisie " is an oxymoron ; the bourgeois is convention incarnate . This makes him extremely nervous and he lives , like Moliere 's M. Jourdan , according to the opinions of others . His natural self-love sours into amour propre , poisoned by fears about his neighbors ' judgment of his lawn , his car , his politics , and his soul . The vice of vanity constitutes his inner life . He wants to be liked , even if not well-liked , if only someone will tell him what rules to conform to . In the end , most do not go as far as M. Jourdan ; most do not try to transform themselves utterly into aristocrats or -- as is more typical today -- proletarians or bohemians . But mostly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . <p> I find that students fit the pattern pretty well . The smugness which their teachers find so exasperating is only an attitude , struck for lack of a better , and easily gives way to self-contempt and cynicism . Last year I heard the actress Jody Foster , recently graduated from Yale , interviewed on a morning news show . The interviewer asked Ms. Foster if playing a rape victim in a film had enabled her to relive the real victim 's plight . Of course not , came the reply , to imagine that would just be " bourgeois . " I gather from this that Ms. Foster had learned her lessons well at Yale . She had learned that " bourgeois " is a synonym for philistine , fake , and vulgar . <p> But did learning this make her less bourgeois ? She may think so , but , to judge by the students I see , she would be wrong . Contempt for the bourgeoisie is in fact a classic and unattractive bourgeois trait that today 's liberal education tends merely to aggravate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently assumes the character of a pathological , " passive aggressive " relationship . On the surface , one parmer constantly exhorts , denounces , and edifies while the other heaps ashes on his head , confesses , and grovels . Really , however , the apparent victim , in this case the student , remains quite untouched , absorbs the critique into a preexisting pattern of self-blame and determination to resist , and often succeeds in revenging himself in typical passive aggressive ways by constantly offering hope of reform and constantly frustrating it . Real liberal education is thus twice blocked : first by the genuine , though hidden , resentment felt against what liberal education appears to be , and second by the students ' delusions that they have overcome their bourgeois limitations when they have merely intensified them . <p> Of course , the question Rousseau raises about the bourgeois is a version of the question we are treating here . There is indeed something defective about the bourgeois as a citizen , precisely because of his irony and anxiety , which are inextricably attached to his privatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgeois wavers between gestures of " commitment " and gestures of cynicism , between bursts of indignant enthusiasm ( for drugs today , against them tomorrow ) and retreats into passivity . The middle position between these gestures which , knowing themselves as gestures , are also done in bad faith , is a moderation essentially helpless , unguided by principle . Argument can lead nowhere : Should we interfere with other governments ? No . What about South Africa ? That 's different . Should we protect freedom of speech ? Yes . What about racist speech ? Well ... <p> It seems to me that ever since Rousseau there has been a great emerging argument in the West about how to ennoble and edify the bourgeoisie . Humanist Marxists , socialist communitarians , teachers of republican virtue , and even , though secretly I think , the overtly unedifying literary critics are all engaged in the task . Of course , as Allan Bloom has reminded us , liberal education always must balance against the prejudices of the regime , partly for the sake of the regime but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not understand itself as essentially or primarily edifying . <p> Yet it seems to me that under current circumstances the argument between thought for its own sake and for political and moral edification is largely moot . This is because , as far as I can tell , all efforts at edification are failures on their own terms precisely because they are sensed , however dimly , as efforts at edification rather than real education . The contemporary version of anti-bourgeois moralizing fails with particularly comic aplomb because it plays right into those bourgeois traits it seeks to overcome . But the more serious nineteenth-century version , which had its roots in German classicism 's project of aesthetic education , failed as well . <p> Unlike contemporary moralism , which conceals itself as open-mindedness , the nineteenth-century version sought to combat mean-spirited anxiety directly . By holding heroic examples to the bourgeois for inspection and emulation , the bourgeois was supposed to become nobler , his vulgar tastes refined , his self-regarding passions generously extended . <p> In Schiller 's Don Carlos , written years before he developed the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , we have the classic test case . The play 's apparent hero , the Marquis Posa , is a good eighteenth-century liberal set in despotic , unenlightened times . He is presented as both noble and democratic , a citizen of the world and a loving friend , a model to the high-minded young of the new , more egalitarian world . <p> But a careful reading of the play shows Posa to be a far more ambiguous character than his edifying appearance , a bad friend and an incompetent politician , motivated by vanity . The true greatness of the play depends on that more careful reading . Yet Schiller 's intent seems to have been to allow the edifying , moralizing reading to be generally accepted . The consequence was that the nobility of the example became unreal . Posa and other Schillerian heroes became hollow plaster casts of classical statuary which could be filled with any political content . Hence those horrible monographs one can still find in card catalogs on Schiller the Nationalist , Schiller the Socialist , Schiller the National Socialist . The ennobled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understood it to be a gesture devoid of content . Hence , in part , the failure of high German culture to create a sufficiently responsible , politically decent bourgeoisie , a failure betokened in many old war movies by the figure of the sensitive , piano-playing German officer who still , justly , gets shot at the end . <p> The most edifying education that middle class Americans can receive , it seems to me , is the one that is the least overtly edifying , the least concerned to hector them or remake them , the one that is most concerned with setting out the matters of fact about themselves and the world . Trivial though this suggestion may appear , its implications may not be . <p> What would such an education look like ? It would share with the contemporary " diversity " movement the goal of letting students understand that their habitual customs and tastes are not simply natural but a product of prior choices that they must either affirm or reject . That means it would have to make available to them the Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Starting with a polemical animus against what the students presumably are , one teaches a wide variety of texts , taken out of the context of highly developed cultures , which are then made comprehensible by a hopelessly Western , if antibourgeois , analysis . The result is gesture and costume . Like those Nobel Hurons and Compassionate Pashas the eighteenth-century Enlightenment loved so dearly , the student sees the Other dressed in exotic garb , but he is really looking in the mirror and all he ever sees is himself . Thus he thinks he is learning " non-Western values , " when in fact it is only in a particular part of the West that faiths are thought of as " values . " Because he does not know himself he can not know the Other and thus can not know himself through the Other . Adding Fanon to the canon in no way rescues students from the grasp of Dead White European Males ; it merely adds a couple of outfits to the great historical fashion show to go with , say , the guitar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alternative would be to start with the West , not tormented by the bizarre dogma that everyone , from Aristotle to Augustine , was really just confirming the goodness of the American status quo . There students discover versions of the good , human types , which both distress and attract them : honor-loving warriors , contemplation-loving philosophers , God-fearing prophets and mystics , serious , warlike relativists , irrationalist scientists . They come to see for themselves what they are , what their lives are and generally will be like . As they reflect on their own responses to the arguments they are faced with , they come to understand the bourgeois not as a historical accident or , as Ms. Foster was taught , a social solecism , but as the product of a very serious choice that has its strengths and limitations . <p> On this basis , they can , if they are willing to expend the costs in time and energy , study a non-Western culture in a serious way , learning the language , taking its account of the good as seriously as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect it will be much easier in most cases to find the way to the samurai ideal from the Greek gentleman described by Aristotle than from the contemporary antibourgeois bourgeois prejudice which shudders at the very notion of rank , or to find the way to Asian religion from a serious study of Augustine than from the contemporary dogmas of those who understand religion only as a manifestation of " culture . " <p> On this basis , too , students can , I think , become better citizens of a liberal democracy . They learn how to escape from the plight of M. Jourdan , alternating helplessly between the attitudes of immense self-satisfaction and total anxiety . It is not that they are freed from irony about themselves . On the contrary , their irony will be far deeper because it will not have the phony salvation of progressive self-righteousness to offer it temporary and inadequate relief . They know much better than before just how far they are from what is truly excellent . But this knowledge , partly because it is knowledge , their knowledge , need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own shortcomings is part of one 's life , one 's possession , and not a perpetual damnation by some unappeasable figure of authority . In those circumstances , it makes sense to try to change oneself from inside , to approximate standards that are not merely one 's own but which one has made one 's own , without regard to the opinions of others . <p> This is of course what those who sought to ennoble the bourgeoisie were after ; it is at the heart of the Kantian project that even now , in scientific disguise as Kohlbergian psychology , heavily influences the schools . But that end can not be held up as an ideal or hypostatized into a standard . If the end is already known , if we communicate , however subtly , that becoming more sensitive , or a more virtuous citizen , or a despiser of bourgeois vulgarity , or even an autonomous moral being is the goal of education , then that education degenerates into edification . Only if all the cards are put on the table can students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hot gospeling are constitutive of their bourgeois lives , emerge from the crippling irony and anxieties that are at root the same thing , whether they express themselves as cynicism or dogmatism . Only then can students become what they are , which is a necessary step to becoming something better than they are as citizens , as human beings , and yes , as members of the bourgeoisie . <p> <p> By Fred Baumann <p> <p> Fred Baumann is associate professor of political science at Kenyon College , Gambier , OH 43022 . <p> 
##4000365 Section : ISSUES <p> A Cleveland Plain Dealer article refers to the " skyrocketing population figures of blacks and Hispanic youth . " Time magazine devoted its 9 April 1990 cover story to " America 's Changing Colors , " and asked on its cover , " What will the U.S. be like when whites are no longer the majority ? " These new demographics , as such projections are frequently and approvingly called , are invoked by educators to argue that inevitable demographic changes require a transformation of American schools and colleges , particularly in curriculum . This is one of the most popular ideas in American education today . Proclaimed in educational publications , reports , and conferences , it is ubiquitous and unchallenged . Workforce 2000 <p> The source of the new demographics is Workforce 2000 , a report that has proved far more influential than its authors probably envisioned . Workforce 2000 deserves much of the attention it has received . Published in 1987 by the United States Department of Labor , it compiles studies by the Hudson Institute on the nation 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of Workforce 2000 is to alert policy makers of the social changes that may affect American productivity and competitiveness . The research is carefully done , and its implications are effectively elaborated . Sparing the readers social scientific jargon , the report is also refreshingly readable . <p> The serpent in the garden , however , is this short sentence : " The cumulative impact of the changing ethnic and racial composition of the labor force will be dramatic . " 1 Somebody got carried away rhetorically , and the editors let it slip by . For this statement simply is not substantiated . <p> The report does show that by the year 2000 women , blacks , Hispanics , and immigrants will make up 85 percent of new job seekers . But this is the percentage of new job seekers , not the percentage of the total workforce . More importantly , the categories themselves are misleading because white women are the largest " minority " group listed . White women , according to Workforce 2000 , will account for 42 percent of new entrants into the workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and nonwhite , will account for 22 percent , leaving 20 percent to native nonwhite males and females , and 15 percent to native white males . These numbers seem to indicate a revolutionary transformation of America 's ethnic profile -- but only if one forgets that white women have been included in the minority population , and only if one confuses new job seekers with the total workforce or the total population . <p> According to Workforce 2000 , " black women will comprise the largest share of the increase in the non-white labor force . " In fact , " black women will outnumber black men in the workforce . " This statistic suggests that the increase in the numbers of working black women is due more to their being women than to their being black . It does not prove that the total percentage of the population that is black is increasing dramatically . <p> Nevertheless , the new demographics have popularized the notion that minorities will become the majority over the next couple of decades . That simply is not true. 2 Minority groups as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 are increasing in inverse proportion to their relative size . That is to say , the most rapidly growing minority groups are also the smallest ( see table 1 ) . <p> Asians are the fastest growing minority . Between 1970 and 1980 , America 's Asian population grew 143 percent , but Asians make up a small percent of the American population . Despite its large growth rate , the Asian population grew from only 0.7 percent of the American population in 1970 to 1.5 percent in 1980. 4 The highest estimates suggest that by the year 2000 , Asians may grow to as much as 4 percent of the population . Similarly , the growth of America 's Hispanic population will not soon make Hispanics a large group . This population grew 39 percent between 1980 and 1989 , a seemingly large rate , but it caused the Hispanic population to grow from only 6.3 percent of the American population to its current 8.2 percent. 5 ( Of course , in California and Texas , Hispanics do make up a large proportion of local communities . ) Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is growing the most slowly of all . Blacks currently constitute about 12.5 percent of the population ; they will make up 13.1 percent by the year 2000 and 14 percent by 2025 . Some Nonimplications for Higher Education <p> The mistaken conclusion that America 's ethnic minorities will become the majority has been eagerly seized on by many educators and taken to a still more absurd extreme , namely , that the population of college students will soon be composed predominantly of minorities . But even if minorities were to become the majority in the total population , the evidence indicates that the same result would not be achieved , at least not automatically , in the student population . American Indians , for example , are underrepresented in higher education when compared to their fraction of the population of the United States . In 1988 , American Indians made up only 0.7 percent of American college enrollments. 6 Asians are well represented , but they constitute a small fraction of the population . College-age blacks ( like college-age whites ) are actually a shrinking cohort . From 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 11 percent. 7 The Hispanic population is growing in the United States , but this fact does not automatically translate into hopeful projections for college attendance . According to a study by Arthur Levine and Associates : <p> The growth of Hispanic enrollment is not yet fully apparent in secondary and postsecondary education because the Hispanic population is very young , it continues to drop out of high school at a high rate , and the fraction of Hispanic high school graduates going on to college has declined since the 1970s. 8 <p> We all wish that more minorities , especially underrepresented minorities , would attend college . Better practices in grade school and high school and increased transfer opportunities from two-year colleges , where most minority freshman enroll , might help . But even the most optimistic projections of minority participation do not suggest that minorities will transform American higher education . <p> Furthermore , those who draw pedagogic and curricular implications from the new demographics ignore the diversity within the large ethnic categories they feature . For example , to discuss the educational patterns of Hispanics , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former showing relatively dismal participation in higher education , while the latter are well represented . In a similar vein , M. Yukie Tokuyama complains that the Asian groups identified by the United States Census Bureau " exhibit different employment patterns , occupations , incomes , and poverty levels . Moreover , there are differences within subgroups-linguistic , political , educational , generational , and occupational . " 9 Yet , many educators and journalists persist in claiming that broadly-defined minority groups , each assumed to be monolithic , will all demand exactly the same change in higher education . Multiculturalism <p> The change minority students are supposed to demand is that undergraduate curricula should include the study of minority and Third World cultures , necessarily at the expense of the traditional , supposedly " Eurocentric " curriculum . Thus , some educators are using the new demographics to argue for the justice , wisdom , and inevitability of so-called multiculturalism . But even if the exaggerations of the new demographics and its academic corollary were true , do demographic trends really compel curricular changes ? <p> No one ever thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on European cultural achievements , was justified on the ground that most Americans are of European descent . On the contrary , the justification for that curriculum has been that the American polity-its social , economic , and political system-derives from European antecedents and has been informed by the thought of European philosophers . Beyond that , further justification for the European emphasis follows from the fact that liberal education originated in ancient Greece and all of the disciplines it now comprises developed within that tradition , albeit with heavy , repeated , and crucial borrowings from a wide variety of non-European cultures . It is , therefore , not at all obvious that changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of the population should have any effect on college curricula . The purpose of American education has been to prepare our young people for the future and not to tie them to their ancestral past . <p> In what approaches a parody of the argument from demographics to curriculum , Annette Kolodny , dean of the faculty of humanities at the University of Arizona , writes in the Chronicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " colleges should change teaching practices : " different cultural groups may emphasize one cognitive style over another-for example , reasoning by analogy instead of strict linear logic . " 10 Dean Kolodny does not identify which cultural groups lack the capacity for logic , though she claims that at one university : <p> young women were using empathy as a learning strategy . What frustrated them was that their instructors rarely introduced specific case histories ; raw data abstracted from case studies made up the bulk of the material presented in the classroom . In that learning context , the men performed better than the women . And the women switched majors . <p> What ugly thoughts lurk behind such statements ? Can women not think as well as men ? Do individuals of different ethnic groups have different mental capacities ? Dean Kolodny does not pause to consider the practical implications such differences would have . <p> Echoing the alarmist rhetoric of nineteenth-century Nativist and Know-Nothing movements , the new demographics proponents picture current immigrants as intractable agents of alien cultures that will forever transform the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : because the major sources of American immigration these days are nationalities that ( by chance ) fit America 's conventional taxonomy of minorities ( namely , Asians and Hispanics ) , immigration patterns require a concomitant multicultural response , especially in school curricula . <p> In fact , today 's immigrants largely mirror the culture they are about to join . For example , a recent survey of immigrants found that " the newcomers , whether Arabs , Vietnamese , or other Asians , are mostly Christians . " 11 And Barry A. Kosmin , who conducted the study , stated that " most immigrants are in the mainstream of the Judeo-Christian culture . " ( The survey revealed that 86.5 percent of the immigrants declared that they were Christian , 1.8 percent Jewish , and the balanced stated no religion or simply did not respond . ) If this is true for their religious beliefs , why should we assume that immigrants differ in other cultural respects from the present population of the United States ? In particular , why should we expect that they want their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans or past immigrants ? Would it not be more reasonable to assume that immigrants come to America , in part , to provide their children the educational benefits our schools are already known to provide ? <p> Besides , there is nothing new about large numbers of immigrants coming to the United States . Consider that in 1980 , 6 percent of Americans were foreign born compared to 9 percent in 1940 and 13 percent in 1920. 12 The United States has a long history of diverse immigration , the most diverse in the New World , according to Roger Daniels , who concludes that although the United States received a variety of Europeans during the colonial period , other colonized countries , such as Canada , Australia , and those of Latin America showed a comparatively homogeneous immigrant pattern. 13 Many kinds of immigrants have come to America and enriched it , but they did not come to replicate what they left . Indeed , many wished to escape their native countries ' most pernicious elements . <p> Why encourage minorities to attend college only to deny them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force minority students to undertake a multicultural curriculum at the expense of courses traditional college students took to secure seats in professional schools and careers ? Why insist that minorities should attend college only to change college for them , as if they were not worthy of it as it was ? Thoughtlessness or Worse <p> Proponents of a " multicultural " curriculum advance many arguments to justify their revolutionary demands . Yet their uncritical acceptance of demographic claims unsupported by any evidence -- and the eagerness with which they have used those claims to make " multiculturalism " appear inevitable -- makes one wonder about the character of their commitment . Indeed , their version of multiculturalism fits all too well with the broader desire , evident in certain circles since the 1960s , to denigrate the ideals of the West and to dismantle its institutions . <p> Whether with that motive or merely out of a thoughtless anxiety not to be left off the latest bandwagon , various members of the educational establishment have cited Workforce 2000 as if it were a fiery sword pointing us toward a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Foundation awarded nineteen American universities " cultural diversity " grants . The program 's goal , a foundation press release explained , was to ensure that colleges " keep pace with the rapid demographic and cultural changes under way in American society . " Franklin A. Thomas , president of the foundation , was quoted : " To teach the roots of intolerance . . . we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a basic element of undergraduate education . " Similarly , Peter Brooks , director of Yale University 's Whitman Center for the Humanities , defends the assault on the traditional curriculum by asserting : <p> People who say we 've got to return to a core curriculum are just nostalgic for a kind of cultural consensus that just does n't exist anymore . The freshman class at Berkeley is now 80 percent non-white . That gives you a sense of how much America is changing. 14 <p> The last sentence might more accurately read : " That gives you a sense of how much Berkeley is changing . " At any rate , it is safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California does not represent the United States in general , precisely if Brooks 's figure of 80 percent is correct . <p> Consider , also , the proposal that regional accrediting agencies include evidence of student and faculty racial , ethnic , and sexual diversity as part of the criteria for accrediting colleges . In defending such a policy , Stephen S. Weiner , executive director of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges , asserts without qualification that " American colleges and universities are undergoing massive changes in the racial and ethnic composition of their student bodies . " 15 Weiner argues that , " In 1988 , white , non-Hispanic students accounted for 65 percent of California 's college enrollment , compared with close to 80 percent for the nation as a whole . " Exactly : colleges and universities are 80 percent white and not , as Weiner would have us believe , " undergoing massive changes . " <p> Clearly those who are sounding these themes wish that the United States were different from what it is . Some people want public policy to be based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned policies . Responsible educators such as Dale Parnell , president of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges , have warned that Workforce 2000 has been " widely misquoted. " 16 Yet the new demographics myth persists among many educators and education policy makers . For them , the idea that America 's ethnic mix will soon be transformed appears to be a truth too good to be tested . <p> 
##4000368 Section : REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY <p> Political correctness in American universities is much discussed and often lamented , recently even in mainstream media ; but the focus is usually on elite schools . Politically correct faculty at universities with lower standing can arguably do more harm , for their students are especially ill-equipped to recognize that indoctrination is being substituted for education . Certainly during my undergraduate matriculation at a second-tier branch of a state university system I encountered many unrelievedly politically correct professors whose ideological biases my classmates seemed unable to identify and articulate . <p> The overwhelming force and rigidity of political orthodoxy became so oppressive in an undergraduate research seminar during my final semester that I felt obligated to challenge it . This effort left me an intellectually demoralized , despairing witness of the professoriate 's ideologically induced indifference -- sometimes , hostility -- to serious debate , contrary viewpoint , and even a sincere search for truth . Several other students also came to loathe the seminar , but I do not believe they dearly understood the cause of their dissatisfaction or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological presuppositions instead of benefiting from a truly open inquiry . <p> I joined this seminar because one of my professors , I will call him the Ethicist , strongly encouraged me to do so . Our usual rapport had recently been strained because I had charged in a student evaluation that his personal ethics class had been extremely biased in favor of his quasi-Marxist , radical environmentalist , antiindividualist views . So disturbed was he by my criticisms that he sought me out to defend his pedagogy -- with the unnerving observation that he has " only fourteen weeks to make students question the values of the dominant culture . " I retorted that I did n't see his role as that of deprogrammer but as educator . This unpleasantness notwithstanding , he recruited me for the forthcoming seminar on Indian treaty rights , 1 a project about which he was most enthusiastic . And because I initially thought that the legal issues involved would place a moderately libertarian person like myself on the side of the pro-minority angels , I signed on . What Are Indian Treaty Rights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its faculty requires some historical background and an explanation of the Indian treaty rights controversy now raging in northern Wisconsin . As the result of successful litigation initiated by the Chippewa against the State of Wisconsin in the mid-1970s , they are allowed special hunting , fishing , and timber harvesting rights not enjoyed by other citizens , including all other Indians . Initially , the court determined that the Chippewa were entitled to 100 percent of the " maximum allowable harvest " of various fish and game species on the lands they sold to the federal government a century and a half ago . The court recently reduced this percentage by half . <p> The judicial reasoning supporting this decision opened the door for the Chippewa also to claim valuable timber on publicly , and possibly privately , owned land in the northern third of Wisconsin . Indeed , among the most worrisome consequences of the Chippewa 's court-awarded rights is that real estate titles throughout the upper third of Wisconsin may have been clouded . As the basis for these resource rights , the Wisconsin Chippewa leadership and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior Chippewa and the United States . <p> The court , in addition to accepting the Chippewa 's claims about these treaties , may employ all manner of modern hunting , fishing , and timber-harvesting methods , including spearfishing 2 and gill netting . These fishing methods are otherwise prohibited in Wisconsin because they can bleed a lake of its maximum allowable harvest in one day , thereby dosing it for the rest of the fishing season . Businesspeople in tourism-dependent northern Wisconsin want fishermen to stay at their resorts , eat in their restaurants , and patronize their sportshops . If Chippewa fishing doses a popular lake in their area or drastically reduces the bag limit , these small businesses can lose a great deal . Moreover , sportsfishermen 's fishing-license and club fees keep the lakes stocked with such valued species as walleye and muskie , so when the Chippewa -- who do not pay these fees-spearfish egg-bearing fish , many citizens are angered . Imbalance from the Outset <p> The seminar was composed of a half-dozen students and five faculty members whom I will call Professors Ethicist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Junior Anthropologist . At our first meeting the faculty handed out a generic syllabus that described various goals of a research seminar , but we students were verbally advised simply to " scratch around " and go wherever our interests took us . Several professors announced the names of possible contacts for our research , all of whom were Indian activists , lawyers with Indian organizations , or journalists . <p> At the second meeting Sociologist and Ethicist suggested we consider undertaking a survey of public opinion on treaty rights , and the latter provided his poll on attitudes about affirmative action as a model . Then several of the faculty showed a film defending treaty rights . None offered information about representatives opposing treaty rights . <p> At the third or fourth meeting I began to grasp the ideological raison d'etre of the seminar and to discover the shallowness of the professors ' scholarly standards . When several described an alleged conspiracy by Exxon and other corporate black hats to funnel money into the anti-treaty rights cause , I quietly listened for some time . Then I stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant funding ; indeed , their movement has the hallmarks of a working-class , seat-of-the-pants operation , one too unsophisticated to have either the financial or the public-relations resources of Exxon behind it . The faculty responded with the assertion that one can not expect to find evidence of such corporate malfeasance because capitalist elites are too " crafty " and " resistant to study " to document their machinations . Lack of proof notwithstanding , several professors made comments throughout the seminar revealing their assumption of sub rosa corporate dastardliness . <p> Because no one else seemed inclined to do so , I decided to interview treaty opponents , with whom I was fully prepared to find fault . The seminar professors had indicated that opponents were calling for " abrogation " of the relevant treaties ; my position was that a Senate-ratified treaty is the law , and its conditions must be upheld and honored . But by the fifth or sixth seminar meeting I had made contact with and closely examined the literature of some anti-treaty rights activists . I discovered that the more astute among them did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminar participants , these opponents argue that the term-specific stipulations of the treaties in question had been fulfilled by the federal government , most of them in the last century . Furthermore , any issues arising from the inherent inequities of some treaties had been addressed after World War II by the Indian Claims Commission , which ordered additional compensation for the Chippewa as an explicitly final resolution to any residual treaty claims , a condition accepted by the Chippewa and their attorneys at those earlier proceedings . <p> Many opponents argue that the courts invented the controversial treaty rights by accepting , rather eagerly , a historically dubious explanation for one stipulation in the treaties of 1837 and 1842 . Thus , they charge that judicial activism is the source of the Chippewa 's rights . <p> I obtained copies of all the Lake Superior Chippewa treaties , compared them with the language of the other 360-plus treaties between the federal government and various Indian tribes , and determined the treaty rights opponents ' position has merit . Moreover , I managed to acquire a trenchant , unpublished manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding them . The author , the nationally known and respected anthropologist James A. Clifton , had been an expert witness for the Chippewa until they realized his scholarship did not support their case . <p> When I related these unanticipated findings to the seminar group , along with my opinion that Clifton 's work seriously undermined the basis for the court 's treaty rights decisions , I hoped to ignite scholarly excitement at the intellectually tantalizing prospect of facts and plausible arguments that run counter to the issue 's standard presentation . <p> The faculty 's reaction was underwhelming . My investigation was all very interesting for those " who are into history and legal issues , " I was advised , but we also need to consider questions of " cultural diversity " and the positive " witness " Indian culture offers the West regarding the environment . Senior Anthropologist asked for a copy of Clifton 's unpublished work , and both he and Archeologist called my attention to an informative newspaper article about Clifton that they had on file . Otherwise , my research met either passive resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was free to continue this line of inquiry but that it was much " too narrow " for them . <p> By the seventh meeting , I had spoken at some length with several members of anti-treaty rights groups . I reported to the seminar that , contrary to the views expressed by the faculty , critics of treaty rights were not necessarily racists . But surely I knew , Sociologist objected , that most racist attitudes are latent and difficult to detect or that their problem may not be racism per se , but a lack of " openness to cultural diversity " ? What was in order , he opined , was an examination of George Orwell 's work on the political uses of language . As an example of the potential enlightenment students might expect from such a course of study , he declared , " I 've never met anybody who was pro-abortion , " the dear implication being that those who use that label , instead of pro-choice , are engaged in unseemly propaganda . When I pointed out that a biologist on campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-coerced , unchosen abortion was understandable , Sociologist stared at me for a bit and then said , " Yes , well , he 's in favor of that because of environmental concerns . He 's not pro-abortion , he 's pro-environment . " The Real Seminar Topics <p> The title of the seminar notwithstanding , most of the faculty involved were manifestly uninterested in extensive inquiry and open discussion of the controversy over treaty rights , preferring instead to use the subject as a springboard for their ideological concerns : cultural diversity and antigrowth environmentalism . Because organized opposition to treaty rights is a predominantly white , middle-class movement , the professors could not concede even the possibility of its legitimacy. 3 This class is the bete noire of the advocates of so-called cultural diversity who find bourgeois culture " stupefying , " as Ethicist once put it . They have cast treaty rights opponents as an illegitimate adversary in the several political dichotomies structuring their worldview . To consider opponents ' arguments on their merits would not serve their politically correct dualism of pitting environmentally saintly , oppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promiscuous polluters . I repeatedly challenged these unproven ( and , by the faculty 's own admission , largely unprovable ) stereotypes and dichotomies . The faculty listened to everything I said and then utterly ignored it . I was n't stifled , merely rendered irrelevant . <p> In pursuit of their ideological interests , the seminar professors invited environmentalists to speak to us , encouraged a trip to an anti-mining rally , and chose as their primary seminar project a survey of student and citizen attitudes on environmentalism and treaty rights in Wisconsin . The following are some of the statements that survey subjects were asked to rate according to their agreement or disagreement : <p> I believe scarcity of resources will limit the world 's economic growth in the next ten to twenty years . <p> Humans are different from other creatures but should not be considered superior to them . <p> The natural environment can not sustain present levels of the world 's economic growth . <p> Economic growth must be limited to protect the environment . <p> It is probably too late to prevent environmental catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn to care more about the balance of nature and less about economic growth . <p> Commercial development in Wisconsin is more important than treaty rights . People in American society should try to get along with nature as traditional native Americans have done . <p> I protested that most of the survey questions were irrelevant to the ostensible subject of the seminar , and the results of the survey were not difficult to predict . Those initiated in the doctrines of political correctness would give the right answers while working- and middle-class people in economically depressed northern Wisconsin would find limiting economic growth ridiculous . Thus , the survey team would find a positive correlation between environmentally conscious ( good ) subjects and support for treaty rights , as well as some correlation between those less supportive of the radical environmentalism reflected in the survey questions and objection to treaty rights . Thus it is proven : the morally right-minded support treaty rights . <p> Students who completed the survey were advised " that there are no right or wrong answers . " However , the naked biases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , when I pointed out that Ted Williams , a respected sports journalist , environmentalist , and contributing editor of Audubon magazine , had published a cogent critique of treaty rights and the mythology of Indian as environmental saint , 4 Junior Anthropologist sought to undermine his credibility by observing that many environmentalists believe Williams is actually a developmentalist . Similarly , when I reminded the professors that one of the campus environmental experts who spoke with us had admitted that some Indian fishing was ecologically harmful and unfair to other fishermen , Ethicist responded with the ad hominem charge that this environmentalist was " a conservative man . " Clearly , the seminar faculty thought there were wrong opinions on environmentalism as well as wrong political proclivities . <p> It is , of course , much easier to design politically correct surveys than to investigate the origins and historical context of nineteenth-century Indian treaties . One of the chief faculty architects of the environmental-attitude survey eventually became frustrated with my persistent references both to what the treaties actually said and their documented meaning for treaty signatories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to read a lot of this stuff . I 've got so much else to do ! " <p> In a final attempt to reason with the faculty regarding the seminar 's predominant focus on environmentalism , I sent all five a memo that complained : <p> I still do n't understand all the attention we are paying to environmental issues in this seminar , at least as we move beyond the question of whether the Indians ' fishing/harvesting rights are or are not dangerous to resources . My concern is that laying an eco-aware template over the various issues relating to Indians detracts from the central points of the controversy . <p> Sociologist responded , in relevant part , " The discussion of environmental issues and environmental conceptions represent an effort to examine different aspects of one dimension of the treaty rights issue . " He claimed that " from the very first " there were three " dimensions that were defined as ( a ) concerns about the environment , ( b ) concerns about fairness and rights , ( c ) concerns about cultural diversity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ten weeks into the seminar , the faculty had not structured the project short of setting meeting times . There were no required papers or readings , no lectures , and no exams . The weekly seminar meetings were free discussions during which very little of substance was accomplished . That one of the faculty was stipulating intellectual parameters at this point seemed wholly gratuitous . Willful Ignorance and Petty Arrogance <p> In his lengthy response to my memo , Sociologist revealed his deconstructionist bent : " What some might consider simple facts others might view as complex ideological claims . Further , facts are always viewed within the context of a larger view of the natural and cultural world(s) " ( emphasis in original ) . I responded , in a second memo : <p> Some historical facts have such compelling evidentiary support and logical credibility that they are virtually certain , independent of who posits them ( the Holocaust occurred even if the person telling me so is a militant Zionist or the one denying it has an Ivy League Ph.D . ) . And in between this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decreasing likelihood . The best that reasonable people can do when facts are in dispute is to choose a value of likelihood from this spectrum . To resist or downplay efforts to determine historical fact , whatever one 's reasons , is to choose obscurantism . Moreover ; such a choice can be as convenient for those making ideological claims as the manufacture of pseudo-facts . ( Emphasis added . ) <p> I concluded with the observation that the faculty were demonstrating " a decidedly non-neutral antagonism to any perspective on this issue which deviates from what Clifton calls the New Indian Ring . " 5 Several examples of faculty behavior will illustrate the validity of my charge , to which I never received a response . <p> Because several University of Wisconsin at Madison law professors had issued a report describing opponents of treaty rights and their attorney as " precisely analogous " to the Ku Klux Klan , I was astonished to learn that the attorney in question is a Chippewa , a fact of which the law professors may have been aware. 6 His wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women , had published a provocative editorial imploring her " sisters " to stop " romanticizing " life on the reservation . I copied some of this couple 's intriguing compositions and sent them to the faculty with a proposal that they be invited to speak to us , perhaps even to debate their Madison accusers . Sociologist declared he had n't joined the seminar for " that kind of shtick . " The other four professors agreed with him . <p> Because I persisted in pointing out the significant Chippewa presence in the treaty rights opposition , Ethicist and Sociologist finally felt obliged to explain these aberrant Indians by citing the coopting strategy " known " to be employed by various power elites . The other students appeared to accept this latest spin on the conspiracy theory . <p> Not surprisingly , I was the only seminar participant to bring in an opponent of treaty rights ( one of the other students did make an unsuccessful attempt ) . The faculty reaction to his pending visit can only be described as petty and infantile . Displeased to hear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with smug amusement , asked me what my speaker 's " Indian name " was . Before I could respond , he quipped , " I 'll bet he does n't have one . " When we polled ourselves to determine who would be joining the dinner party for this speaker ( a seminar protocol for most out-of-town guests ) , Junior Anthropologist snidely cracked , " I 'll make up my mind after I hear what he has to say . " <p> After enough such incidents , I confronted Ethicist in his office . First he denied the comments about the Indian speaker 's name . Then he launched into a dizzying display of decon-speak , accused me of " presumption " for believing I knew what he had meant by his remarks , and said that I needed to understand about the " hermeneutics of intentionalism . " This explanation of his attack on the ethnic identity of the Indian treaty rights critic only fueled my outrage , and I advised Ethicist I was considering putting my criticism of the seminar and its faculty in writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter ethical problems , an opinion I have seriously considered and reject . What I write about took place in , or in the context of , a class at a public university , not a confessional . <p> Throughout the seminar most of the faculty participants engaged in entre nous repartee that assumed a common bond of political and religious ( anti-Christian ) correctness among the seminar participants . Sociologist rhetorically asked if the Lutheran synod listed in the credits of a pro-treaty rights film was the one " that did n't require a lobotomy when you joined . " At the end of the semester , with obvious relish and amusement , Junior Anthropologist announced that a student evaluation from another class charged that she appeared to hate white people . She did not infer any legitimate criticism from this student 's observation , nor did her chuckling colleagues , one of whom sighed and stated with mock-resignation , " Yes , it 's a tough job , but somebody 's got ta do it . " In Summary <p> The Indian treaty rights seminar faculty taught me almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminar . They did not even define their terms . That is , we students were never instructed as to what an Indian treaty is , nor were we shown how the courts extrapolated the controversial new Indian rights from certain treaty stipulations . <p> What they did teach is that undemonstrable assertions , at least when they are grounded in correct politics , constitute legitimate support for scholarly conclusions . On the other hand , solid facts that undermine correct politics can be dismissed by " viewing them within the context of a larger view . " Furthermore , the faculty , who were supposedly dedicated to diversity , demonstrated in word and deed that people whose experiences and perspectives do not support political orthodoxy should be ridiculed and despised or at least ignored . <p> To what degree the other students in the seminar accepted the faculty 's ideologically motivated behavior as valid scholarly praxis , I do not know . I suspect that several of them have accepted it . But such a mockery of liberal education ought to be of concern to academics even if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom serves only to demoralize . <p> 
##4000369 I first heard of student protests at Bowdoin College when I returned there in June of 1990 for my twenty-fifth reunion . Outgoing president Leroy Greason , addressing the assembled alumni , mentioned that at the end of the spring semester , a group of students had staged a rally on the steps of Bowdoin 's Art Museum in support of gay and lesbian studies at the college . Greason said that he met with the students and listened to their demands but made them no promises . The event ended with student leaders walking with Greason back to his office and trying unsuccessfully to change his mind . <p> After Greason 's retirement at the end of the academic year , the students ' demands , which included a formal response by 2 November 1990 , fell to his successor , Robert H. Edwards , who assumed office in the fall of 1990 . He began inauspiciously . In his convocation address and again in his inaugural address , Edwards stressed the college 's commitment to diversity . Then , on October 31 , Edwards responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and lesbian studies , by issuing a memorandum " to the college community expressing general support for increased diversity . " Two days later , a group of students , apparently dissatisfied with that response , or , as the alumni newsletter euphemistically put it , " feeling a need for a more specific commitment , " blocked the entrances to the administration building and the library . <p> According to the newsletter 's sketchy account , Edwards met with student representatives and agreed to establish a committee that fall to devise a plan for increasing the number of minority faculty ( including women ) at Bowdoin and to refer a proposal for a gay and lesbian studies program to the faculty . The newsletter concluded by noting that " President Edwards also expressed deep disappointment that the protesters had chosen to block the library . ' Protecting freedom to learn in an open institution is a sacred trust , ' he said . " <p> I , too , was deeply disappointed by the students ' actions , as I told President Edwards in a letter of December 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " freedom to learn in an open institution , " but that they had apparently not been disciplined . On the contrary , Edwards rewarded their efforts by referring their program proposal to the faculty for consideration . Their easy success could only have confirmed the lesson learned by radical students in the 1960s , that where arguments fail to convince , force and intimidation succeed . When the use of force is allowed to play a role in determining curriculum , as at Bowdoin , the integrity of academic procedure is violated . <p> I expressed my fear that faculty consideration of the proposed program would mean , as is often the case with student demands of this nature , that its approval is a foregone conclusion . I suggested that , given the coercive manner in which the students made their demands , their proposal should not be considered . <p> Edwards replied , in a letter dated December 12 , " Every experience I 've had indicates that , when presented by a confrontation that could polarize the campus , it 's best to diffuse it and channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that Edwards and I were working from a number of different assumptions . What he regarded as mere confrontation , I saw as an illegal action by some students that deprived other students of their right to access college facilities . What he saw as a situation that could polarize the campus , I saw as an action that had already polarized the campus , separating those who respect the rule of law from those who respect force . Where Edwards conceived the president 's role as diffusing disorder by acquiescing to the demands of the party causing the disorder , I believed he should enforce the rules that define the college community . <p> To provide details on the student protest and his view of the circumstances surrounding it , Edwards included with this letter several documents : his memorandum of October 31 to the Bowdoin community and the Coalition for Diversity , his statement to the student protesters on November 2 , and his memorandum of November 5 to the trustees and overseers of Bowdoin College . He also included a copy of the coalition 's November 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edwards called diversity " the greatest issue facing American society , " and announced that " I have reiterated my conviction that Bowdoin must create a more welcoming environment for cultural , racial , religious , and socio-economic diversity . " <p> Most alumni must have been surprised to learn that Bowdoin 's atmosphere was less than congenial to groups of people long considered welcome at the college . Edwards did not suggest what made the environment unwelcoming , nor when the negative transformation occurred , nor what could be done to improve the situation . He simply offered an obscure and unsubstantiated indictment of the college 's atmosphere after being on campus only ten weeks . <p> Edwards 's memo also affirmed that " race and gender , as issues , are treated widely throughout the curriculum . " This fact , he said , " demonstrates Bowdoin 's awareness that , although many students arrive on campus ignorant of issues about race , gender , and ethnicity , it is the College 's business that they graduate more enlightened than when they arrived . " Enlightenment , understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender , and ethnicity , marks a significant departure from Bowdoin 's traditional sense of its mission as teaching . <p> Edwards ended his memorandum by saying , " Finally , I would emphasize that this note is only a status report . It is not designed to dispose of the question of diversity , but to open discourse on a subject that will never have a ' solution ' but will require unending commitment , tolerance , and energy from all of us . " Edwards made no attempt to justify his discouraging assertion that this subject would never be solved . Significantly , nothing in his memorandum addressed gay and lesbian studies . <p> Hoping for a response , Edwards delivered his October 31 memorandum in person to a meeting of the Coalition for Diversity , but November 1 passed without an answer . In his November 5 memorandum to trustees and overseers , Edwards explained what happened next : " About 7:00 a.m. on November 2 a group of about 40 students blockaded the entrance to the Library and to Hawthorne-Longfellow Hall . They demanded that the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's demands read as follows : <p> The " status report " presented to the Coalition of Concerned Students on October 31 is inadequate . As previously stated , we demand : a significant increase in the number of faculty from minority groups ( including women ) reflecting the demographical percentages of these groups in the United States . the creation of a position in Gay and Lesbian Studies . <p> The document asked the president to affix his signature to these demands as well as to the following demands : <p> We the Coalition of Concerned Students demand that no disciplinary action be taken against staff members who could not enter the Hawthorne-Longfellow building on November 2 , 1990 . Furthermore , we demand that no disciplinary action , such as dismissal , on the part of Bowdoin College , be taken against students , faculty and staff involved in the protest . <p> The November 5 memo continues the chronology of events following the blockade of the library : <p> By 9:20 a.m . Dean Lewallen had invited 5 or 6 students to the Afro-American Center Library to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my inquiry as to why there had been no discussion , " when the door was open , " I was told that the memo was a regurgitation of what was known ; gave no clear indication as to the action that would be taken , whereas my statement on the budget has promised an interim answer by June of 1991 ; and made no explicit mention of the gay-lesbian demand . <p> Edwards said that he explained to the students the limits of his power to grant their demands , reiterated his agreement " on the diversity issues generally " ( suggesting for the first time that he included gay and lesbian concerns as matters of diversity ) , and proposed language he thought would be acceptable to the students . <p> Following his meeting with student representatives , Edwards went to the library to address a group of " some 50 to 60 students " who were still blocking the building 's entrance . Edwards found the protester " in a cheerful humor " but noted that " there were beginning to be disagreements between the protesters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered the following address to the assembled students : <p> Good morning to all of you . I just wanted to say to all of you that I am warmly in accord with your cause . But as your new president , you need to know -- and I say this from the bottom of my heart to you -- I am deeply disappointed that you have decided to block the library . <p> Libraries represent liberal learning and freedom of education and freedom of thought , and my understanding is that 's what you all stand for . You 've chosen the wrong symbol to block , because blocking libraries and burning books is what happens in fascism in Europe and you need to know that . That 's the starting point . OK ? But secondly -- and let me say -- when this is over , I want you to know that I want to have a continuing discourse with you , because I believe in this cause and I 'm strongly with you . <p> I want you to know that this is a statement that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your group . It says : <p> As I stated in my memorandum of October 31 , I am committed as president of Bowdoin College to expanding diversity at the College . . . . <p> To that end , <p> 1 . I shall meet with department and program chairs in the coming week to establish procedures for advancing this goal through recruitment in the 1991 season . I will also act to establish a committee that will begin work this fall to produce a plan , with time goals , for securing at Bowdoin a significant increase in the number of faculty from minority groups ( including women ) reflecting the demographic percentages of these groups in the United States . I would expect the committee to produce a hard interim report by June 1991 . . . . <p> 2 . I shall introduce to the faculty the proposal to establish a program in gay and lesbian studies and the staffing such a program would require . <p> That being so , I would ask you to disperse from the doors of the library and allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Emphasis in original . ) <p> " I believe , " wrote Edwards of the response to his address , " there was relief all around when the statement was read . " The relief was understandable , because Edwards had just handed the protesters everything they demanded , and they no longer had any reason to prohibit other students from using the library . Some of the protesters lay on the ground an additional fifteen minutes and then dispersed . <p> Edwards continued the November 5 memo with a self-assessment and a look forward : <p> How would I interpret all this , and what might it bode for the future ? There is a head of resentment at Bowdoin , and on a number of other campuses , on the diversity question . At Bowdoin , although there are some who are obdurate and want publicity , most genuinely seek more social , racial , and personal diversity and a welcoming atmosphere for them on the campus . <p> Edwards is obviously conversant with the political implications of diversity and is quick to recognize that some ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it unquestioningly . He therefore divided the campus population into two groups , the right-thinking majority who support diversity and the publicity-seeking opposition . Anticipating that the hard-hearted publicity seekers will continue to resist the mollifying suasions of the diversity camp , Edwards looked to the future with guarded optimism : <p> I believe we can make progress , but would caution that progress will not mean a solution or tranquillity . The more diversity we create , the more the campus will become a forum for expression by those who have suffered prejudice and indignity . This will not necessarily be calm , and it will require steadfastness because this will be the American social agenda of the ' 90s . <p> Edwards , who acceded to the demands of protesters to avoid polarization , pledged himself to keeping the campus in a state of constant polarization . There will be neither tranquillity nor calm , he said , as we pursue the social agenda he proclaims for our entire country for the remainder of the century . Edwards then returned to his assessment of the protest itself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement responding to student demands made undertakings that would have been quite reasonable to agree to in open discourse . The Library and Hawthorne-Longfellow Hall returned to normal after about four hours of disruption , without angry confrontation and polarization of the campus . I believe the protesters now understand the gravity with which the College will view interruptions of its academic processes . The deans will be taking steps to ensure that students henceforth understand the disciplinary consequences of such action . <p> In the only humorous remark I ran across in many memos , Edwards suggested that protesters will now begin to fear the judgment of his administration . On the contrary , the deans might spare themselves the effort of making students " henceforth " understand the consequences of library-block-ing ( as if students normally arrive at Bowdoin without any notion of decorum , rules , or the order of law ) . The students already understand full well the disciplinary penalties of their actions and look forward to being treated again to hollow strictures ( " You 've chosen the wrong symbol to block " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are happy to achieve something less than they demand ; these protesters asked for a slice of bread and received a loaf . Their statement demanded the creation of a position in gay and lesbian studies . Edwards promised to propose a program in gay and lesbian studies and the staffing such a program would require , thus revealing a greater enthusiasm for gay and lesbian studies than the protesters themselves demonstrated . <p> That enthusiasm is evident in the conclusion of the November 5 memo : <p> Regarding gay and lesbian studies , the College has established procedures for considering new academic programs which are faculty-driven , and gay rights is a volatile and political issue , with much potential for militancy and backlash . The faculty understand the importance of the College 's taking control of the issue , creating a rational process for analyzing it as an academic question-evaluating the research , disciplinary base , and theory that exist -- before considering the appropriateness of a new program at Bowdoin . The issue will be discussed at the coming faculty meeting . <p> Thus , Edwards injected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' statement of November 2 did not mention and which does not follow from his earlier reference to the academic issue of gay and lesbian studies . And once again , he attempted to discredit any opposing view in advance by yoking it with such strongly negative concepts as " backlash " and " militancy . " <p> As his various correspondence makes clear , Edwards regards diversity as the central concern of Bowdoin or of any college or university today . Just as clearly , he described that issue in Manichean terms , with good will and moral right on the side of diversity and ill will and immoral views on the other side . He took an advocacy position and , while pretending that nonaligned persons are welcome within the diversity camp , really left no neutral ground . However , as college president , he can not act as both advocate and judge . <p> In ending his letter to me , Edwards made a heavily hedged acknowledgment of a position on campus opposed to his own : " There are , incidentally , strong indications that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , tactics like blocking the library produce antibodies of resistance that deflect attention from the very cause the protesters seek . " However , within less time than it takes to study for a final exam , the protesters received agreement to all their demands , and more . To suggest that the tactic of blocking the library produced anything less than total victory for the student protesters , as Edwards did , is misleading . <p> In all that Edwards writes , a great deal is left unsaid . Nowhere does he admit that the opposition has valid arguments . Much has been written against affirmative action and a curriculum driven by political concerns . On campuses across the country , there are professors who question the appropriateness of a separate discipline devoted to homosexuality ( what of heterosexual studies ? ) . I mentioned the last of these points in my letter to Edwards , but he wrote nothing in response . <p> Similarly , Edwards left a great deal unsaid about his own views , which are offered without substantiation . He asserted that Bowdoin must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small college in Maine with a long history of drawing the majority of its students from Maine and Massachusetts should mirror the demographics of all fifty states . <p> Edwards 's reaction to the library incident is easier to understand in light of statements made in his convocation address , in which he saw " a fresh task before us of dimensions even greater , in a way , than those early Congregationalists faced when they set forth Bowdoin as a light and a beacon on what they considered to be their ' errand into the wilderness . ' " Judging that " we have perhaps yet another wilderness before us , " Edwards asserted that Bowdoin 's new mission is " to create a just and cultivated society . " Continuing the theme of social engineering , Edwards said he came to Bowdoin " with no interest in control , but with great interest " in engaging the college community " in defining the meaning of culture in modern America . " He went on to include within that sphere of definition not only " knowledge and understanding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed Bowdoin 's nearly 200-year-old mission from imparting knowledge and transmitting culture to creating a new society and defining culture ( including behavior ) . His promotion of the cause of homosexual studies and even of gay rights may be the first step in fulfilling the college 's new charter . <p> Through all his memoranda , addresses , and statements , it becomes apparent that Edwards believes not so much in allowing diversity to exist as in imposing " diversity , " coupled with a studied antagonism toward any opposing point of view . I found myself agreeing with Edwards on one matter : in the next few years , Bowdoin can look forward to troubled times . <p> By Gary Crosby Brasor <p> <p> Gary Crosby Brasor , formerly assistant professor of French at Howard University , is a policy analyst at Digital Equipment Corporation , 200 Forest Street , Marlboro , MA 01752 . <p> 
##4000371 As students of power relations have known for years , Machiavellian strategies can operate in academic departments just as they do in the larger world . Indeed , with such ideals as objectivity , rationality , and the disinterested pursuit of truth now subject to widespread ridicule by ideological militants and devotees of postmodernism , hardball politics may be more commonplace on campus than off . Unfortunately though , among the torrent of books and articles documenting the rising influence of academic ideologues , there has been little if any attempt to analyze the concrete political strategies by which activist faculty gain and perpetuate their power . This article is intended to rectify this oversight and to propose some acceptable countermeasures for those who wish to resist . The Ideological Cartel and Departmental Governance <p> Prof. Holley H. Ulbrich recently coined the term academic cartel to describe a small , closely knit group of professors who seek to enhance their academic standing and vocational benefits by dominating the decision-making machinery of a department. 1 Understanding university life as characterized by fluid coalitions that shift in response to changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " circumstances peculiar to academe virtually guarantee a lifetime for the departmental cartel that is brief . " 2 Our view , however , is that this fairly benign prognosis seriously underestimates the contemporary power of shared ideology and common political cause to neutralize " circumstances peculiar to academe , " freeze alignments , and extend the existence of departmental cartels indefinitely . Cartel Strategies <p> The key goal of an ideological cartel is to capture the departmental chairmanship , for it is the occupant of this position who usually appoints committees , defines and redefines jurisdictions , writes job descriptions and agendas , oversees peer review , and establishes the framework for hiring . As intermediary between dean and department , the chairman also exercises substantial control over the flow of information to higher levels , shaping impressions about the relative merits and contributions of the department 's members . This differential evaluation is often accompanied by what Richard Rorty calls " a lot of ad hoc departmental rhetoric " contrived to reeducate the powers that be about " the nature of the discipline . " 3 Once an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other strategies for cartel maintenance become far easier to execute . These are addressed in the following paragraphs . <p> The incremental transformation of the department 's agenda . The composition and orientation of a department are the cumulative result of successive decisions about courses and hiring . Continuity of control over these decisions is maintained by appointing cartel members as chairmen of departmental committees having jurisdiction over course additions , course deletions , the rewriting of course descriptions , and program reviews . Given enough time , the curriculum decisions made by these committees will restructure faculty needs and determine recruiting . When they do , two crucial consequences follow : noncartel faculty are gradually marginalized and rendered vulnerable to pressure to switch departments , seek jobs at other institutions , or take early retirement , and future recruiting focuses on those who share the cartel 's ideological vision of the discipline . <p> The dissolution of fixed structures . This strategy replaces permanent bodies possessing established jurisdictions and elective memberships with ad hoc ones appointed by the chair . These bodies are then empowered to make policy and procedural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The manipulation of information . Even when a departmental vote can not be avoided , control can still be maintained by withholding information until university deadlines are at hand . Then , cartel members -- having already determined their own position -- call the required meeting and force votes on policies that others have had little or no time to evaluate . <p> Cartel members can complement this strategy by reducing the number of departmental meetings ( easily done , for few faculty members campaign for more meetings ) . Infrequent meetings make it harder for noncartel members to pool knowledge from noncartel sources about emergent policy changes , and they prevent dissidents from confronting cartel leaders with potentially embarrassing questions . <p> The development of flexible evaluation methods so that performance scores of cartel members can be inflated in areas of responsibility they prefer to avoid . There are activities that university administrators respect but do not generously reward . To remain " respectable , " cartel members must avoid these burdens without incurring onus . Unfortunately , teaching ( especially of undergraduates ) is frequently regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teach inordinately heavy loads , thereby subsidizing the minimal teaching responsibilities of those inside the cartel. 4 In universities where teaching accounts for a sizeable percentage of the annual evaluation , policies must be manipulated to ensure that cartel members receive ratings equal or superior to those carrying the heavier burdens . This can be accomplished by various techniques , including preferentially assigning more lightly enrolled elective courses to cartel members or allowing them to teach seminars that do not require much preparation . Releasing time from teaching in return for nominal administrative assignments is yet another way to allow the favored to look better than they deserve . Adroit information management and appropriate obfuscation can hide these privileges from any but the most persistent inquiry . <p> The use of gossip to discredit dissidents . Accusations and rumors of sexual harassment , problem drinking , crankiness , lack of congeniality , or insubordination can irritate institutional sensibilities and identify the accused as " the other . " 5 This transforms legitimate intellectual differences into a question of personal failure , thereby discrediting criticism . <p> The suppression of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some larger university mandate . This maneuver requires a powerful act of intimidation to deter future debunking . For example , cartel members can seize an argument designed to reaffirm , in the midst of ideological dominance , the legitimacy of a nonideological perspective and reinterpret it as an attack on the moral purposes of the institution . This becomes easier as colleges and universities , often without much reflection , adopt vague mission statements on the importance of diversity , multiculturalism , and a sensitive learning environment . Cartel members can present the " subversive " argument to sympathetic university officials when its author is not on hand to rebut the argument 's misconstruction . At appropriate moments , the cartel departmental chair can then state or , even better , merely hint that senior administrators found the dissident position " disturbing . " Challenging Cartel Dominance <p> Most of those likely to be left out of ideological cartels entered the academy not out of any zest for confrontation but to enjoy the calm , quite pursuits of scholarship and teaching . But , as Machiavelli says , when " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not " change his mode of proceeding . " 6 Thus , when confronted by an ideological cartel , professional survival may well require developing a combativeness not originally thought part of the academic job description . For those willing to summon the appropriate resolve and application the following course is recommended . <p> Document everything . Since the leaders of the cartel have kept files and bestride the official channels of communication , it is necessary to retain memoranda , letters , announcements , and meeting agendas ( as well as to take minutes independently ) in order to document procedural tricks and double standards . Dissidents need such records to establish their credibility with administrators . <p> At every opportunity aggressively and openly question cartel policies . The question mark , as Saul Alinsky observed , is an inverted plowshare , a " carrier of the contagion of curiosity . " 7 Asking pointed questions at committee and departmental meetings forces cartel members to formulate convincing and internally consistent justifications for salary decisions , teaching assignments , committee appointments , and procedures in general . Forcing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or force cartel members to adhere to more evenhanded procedures , thereby weakening the cartel 's effectiveness . <p> Promote counter-pressure . Ulbrich advises dissidents to " raise the costs of cartel behavior by constant monitoring , by grievances , by complaints flied with the higher administration , and by establishing a reputation for the cartel among other academic departments so as to predispose any grievance hearing toward the grievant and . . . to create alliances within the local academic community that may bear fruit in the future . " 8 A problem does not exist until people define it as such ( to paraphrase Alinsky ) . 9 Encouraging colleagues to visit deans and air their complaints , either individually or collectively , alerts administrators that all is not well . A series of memos exposing the cartel , particularly from someone who has both seniority in the profession and tenure in the department , can also be very effective . <p> Redress intellectual power imbalances by calling in outsiders and create new forums for discussion . To legitimatize intellectual alternatives , dissidents can cite respected scholars from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring these professors to the campus as speakers . Dissidents can also sponsor educational programs , for example , brown-bag luncheons , focusing on such topics as departmental governance or the erosion of academic freedom . <p> Press colleagues to take a stand . In circumstances of ideological oppression , faculty must be aware of the Machiavellian necessity to choose : <p> A prince is also esteemed when he is a true friend and a true enemy , that is , when without any hesitation he discloses himself in support of someone against another . This course is always more useful than to remain neutral , because if two powers close to you come to grips , either they are of such quality that if one wins , you have to fear the winner , or not . In either of these two cases , it will always be more useful to you to disclose yourself and to wage open war ; for in the first case if you do not disclose yourself , you will always be the prey of whoever wins , to the pleasure and satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , nor anything , to defend you or give you refuge . For whoever wins does not want suspect friends who may not help him in adversity ; whoever loses does not give you refuge , since you did not want to share his fortune with arms in hand. 10 <p> Those who prefer others to do their fighting for them forfeit their claims to respect and risk coming to grief however things turn out . Once the campaign against the cartel acquires real momentum , fence-sitters should be reminded of this basic fact of life . <p> Alert college administrators to the fact that ideological cartels can expose the institution to embarrassment . It is becoming increasingly obvious that administrators who allow ideological cartels to flourish open themselves to embarrassment when the media and public observe the intolerance , zealotry , and abuses of power that these cartels engender . Repeated allusions in appropriate campus forums to conspicuous examples of such embarrassment may eventually penetrate the consciousness of even the most resistant provost or academic dean . <p> When all else fails , inform the media , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high-risk venture to be considered only in serious situations when there is no further internal recourse , iniquitous policies that for ideological reasons may pass muster within colleges and universities almost always look different when exposed to broader scrutiny . Moreover , savvy administrators may sometimes welcome such exposures as a means of weakening or overthrowing cartels they are otherwise helpless to confront . Needless to say , however , the personal costs of following this course may prove high for the whistle-blower . Conclusion <p> In the past , it was believed that the commitment of scholars to the canons of reason and evidence prevented the ideological capture of most academic departments . However , such transformations not only take place but do so through strategies that are likely to render them permanent . In these new circumstances , those holding traditional academic values may find themselves defined or harassed out of professional existence . As unpleasant as it may be , scholars must learn to recognize and respond to these attempts , which are likely to become increasingly common in the 1990s . These days , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasten one 's ruin . <p> 
##4000372 Section : ISSUES <p> I am taking it as given that politicization and low academic standards are the enemies of liberal education , that those enemies are currently in the ascendant , that my readers agree with me about this , and that they agree with me about little else . <p> There are two questions that I wish to address in this essay . The first is : In what sense of " defense " is liberal education in need of defense ? The second is : What are we defending ? Both questions turn on the difference , to put it crudely , between philosophy and politics , or , if you wish , between theory and practice or between scholarship and action . <p> Scholars accentuate their disagreements . They like to sharpen the issues . The deeper each goes into a question , the more he disagrees with every other scholar . And that is all to the good . It furthers understanding . Scholars , in addition , wish to win battles by fact and logic , not by the number of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement who does not understand it , that is disagreeable . But in a political battle , it does not matter why you vote with me as long as you do . Our agreement need only be practical , not philosophical . That is why politics makes strange bedfellows . The art of finding a ground on which we who agree about little can , nevertheless , stand together is not an art to be despised . It is , nonetheless , a political not a philosophical art . <p> Because scholars disagree about matters of fundamental import , they will not agree about the essence of liberal education . For the idea of liberal education is part of a network of ideas -- about knowledge , human nature , society , and God -- that are essentially contested . If we could agree about the exact form and contents of an ideal curriculum , we would already possess answers to all the unanswered questions that make liberal studies so lively an enterprise . Our failure to agree on a definition of liberal education is , therefore , as it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should teach the questions . But that is no answer . For we also disagree about which questions are meaningful , which are important , and which are still unanswered . In addition , this emphasis on questions obscures -- and perhaps is meant to obscure -- the fact that there is a great deal of knowledge that is almost beyond question , much of which should be conveyed to our students . Indeed , one of the most prevalent forms of contemporary politicization is an exaggerated emphasis on questions . For this has the effect of undermining the entire enterprise : its covert message is that there is no truth to be had and , hence , that questions are not to be taken seriously , that liberal studies are a game , and that nothing of importance remains except political commitment unqualified by information or reflection . Plying a sea of questions without the ballast of knowledge is a dangerous business . No wonder so many students and schools capsize . Furthermore , not to teach that which is known , and not to insist on accuracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our inadequately prepared college students and to perpetuate the low standards to which they have become habituated . And pandering breeds boredom . For one must first know something , before he can find the deeper questions intelligible , much less exciting . <p> So we are back to the fact that those of us who are most concerned to defend liberal education do not agree on its definition . This theme can be developed in greater detail than I have room for here . For example , many of those with a religious orientation claim that the root of politicization goes back to the same Enlightenment conceptions to which others appeal in opposing politicization . Hence , while on the issue of the moment we may agree , that agreement is like a sheet of ice over the liquid depths of more interesting disagreements . <p> That would be fine , if our interest were purely philosophical . However , we do not oppose politicized scholarship in idea merely . Instead , it is an immediate practical threat , undermining all our versions of liberal education . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arguing the issues . Instead , his object is power , not truth , and therefore he is unmoved by rational argument . Thus the defense liberal education needs is political , not philosophical . To see what this defense requires , let us examine the character of politicization more closely . Politicization 's Progress <p> How did the academy become politicized ? What were the rest of us doing ? Why did we let it happen ? It all seems so improbable -- so much so , indeed , that many people , both in and outside the academy , have trouble believing it is a fact . The explanation has several parts , but the major part has been overlooked , just because it stares us in the face : the politicized minority gained power precisely because it is politicized and the rest of the professoriate is not . Preferring power to truth , the politicized scholar can be ruthless , hence , efficient , in the pursuit of power . <p> Had genuine scholars been interested in power , they would not have become scholars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left in the 1960s . Having succeeded as students in imposing their will on entire institutions , they naturally wanted to continue the fun as adults -- and to make their livings at it . So they became scholars , of a sort , while retaining their commitment to " activism . " And they succeeded easily -- just as easily as they had won their student victories over reason and fair play . Hence the advent of the well-named " Tenured Left . " <p> It is true that by the 1960s , scholarship and teaching had already declined to the point where they were vulnerable to any intrusion bearing some signs of vitality . The curriculum had already become a wasteland of arid professionalism and premature specialization . Coherence and educational purpose were long since sacrificed on the convenient altar of student choice ( merely an excuse for teachers to pursue their scholarly specialties in undergraduate courses ) . This was the fertile field on which fell the seed of the weed called " relevance . " And many professors had become so involved in shallow careerism that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were not unhappy to gain a little extra time for their research , when student " activists " managed to shut down classes or put an end to grading . The same sort of professors are unperturbed today when their colleagues debase the curriculum with undemanding political content . It is also true that many of those who were paying attention lacked any defense against radical demands . Always they said , " Well , I do n't like their tactics , and they are going too far , but it 's in a good cause and I can not oppose them . " The same sort of professors are still saying that , but now it is about what their colleagues are doing . They profess to care about the rights or welfare of women and minorities , but in fact they do not care enough to oppose the outrageous things being done in their names . Nor do they understand the purposes of education sufficiently to see why the curriculum should not be politicized " in a good cause . " <p> Essential as these factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to recognize , in addition , that psychologically and institutionally the academy was not -- is not -- prepared to withstand the importunities and stratagems of the politically motivated . I have already touched on the psychological aspect -- the fact that genuine scholars are not girded for battle . Indeed , one might go further : a major impetus of scholarship -- beginning with Plato 's founding of his school in the original groves of Academus -- is to retreat from the hurry-burly of political strife , the better to understand it . Scholars are by nature the men and women least inclined to sacrifice accuracy and nuance to the crude demands of political rhetoric , and they are the persons least inclined to sacrifice to the exigencies of the moment that leisure which is necessary to their taking a large view of things . It should therefore surprise no one that genuine scholars have not been very good at defending themselves from the dirty work done by their politicized counterfeits . <p> But more important than psychological considerations is the fact that the academy as an institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance evolved to protect it from external political pressures but not to protect it from organized internal pressures to conform to a particular political program . Internally , that system serves to protect our enterprise from the biases that vary with individuals and from those plays for power to which overweening ambition leads an occasional scholar . It presupposes that nearly all academics have at least a large measure of commitment to the traditional goals of teaching and learning . It does not work when there is a sizeable minority who share essentially the same political goal and who are shameless in their pursuit of the power to advance that goal -- at whatever cost to truth and education . This is the reason the academic Left has succeeded in taking control of higher education , despite the fact that a ( diminishing ) majority of professors remain unpoliticized . <p> When faculty debates and committee deliberations -- never to tell the truth , noted for their high intellectual level -- are undermined by the concerted action of those who plan their strategies beforehand , who applaud speakers on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard big lies , such as that Western civilization is racist and sexist ) , and who do all they can to distract attention from the arguments of the " other side " and to intimidate those who dare make such arguments ( especially by calling them racists and sexists ) , then the system no longer works . For it depends on a certain amount of civility , intellectual honesty , and multidimensional disagreement -- as opposed to the reduction of every issue to two " sides . " Nor is there any mechanism in place to prevent the academic Left from tirelessly proposing new programs , recycling the same tiresome ideas in ever new forms . Opposition from genuine scholars , who would rather be doing their proper work , is thus exhausted , and students graduate " knowing " little more than that Western civilization is racist , sexist , and " homophobic . " Nor is there any mechanism for monitoring individual classes for such flagrant abuses of academic freedom as irrelevant political harangues , known falsehoods presented as fact , and biased grading . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat , forty years ago , was one of the means attempted for external political control of the academy . Defending Liberal Education <p> What , then are we to do ? There is no way out of this ocher than to explain -- clearly , repeatedly , and patiently to all who we can get to listen -- that politicization has changed the game and chat the game can not be restored without changing the rules , at least for the duration . We need to explain that academic freedom , which ordinarily requires independence from outside interference , calls for just such interference when that freedom is being subverted from within . Not that parents or trustees or the public should dictate curricula ; however , they have every right to refuse to fund those institutions that permit their own faculties to violate the principles of academic freedom or that otherwise do not live up to their own pretensions . In addition , we have to build up an internal body of resistance -- a group of faculty and administrators who understand what is at issue , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an alternative in answer to a public call for reform . <p> But for the purpose of gaining public support , as well as to gain the support of our colleagues , we need to be clear not only about what the academic Left is doing but also about what it is that our society is losing thereby . And this brings us to our second question : What shall we defend ? For all talk of strategy and technique is trivial in comparison to clarity about our goal . Nor can we move anyone if we only complain of what is wrong , and are perceived as mere carpers and cavilers . We must also say what it is that we stand for , and we must make that statement inspiring . Despite our philosophical differences , we have to find a common ground on which to make our appeal to colleagues , parents , trustees , and the public . Politicization 's Paralyzing Paradoxes <p> Here we confront a paradox . Scholarship leads us to sharpen our disagreements , rarely to resolve them , while an effective defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can stand together . The language of political campaigns is adopted deliberately . For another form of the paradox is this , that to fight the politicization of scholarship we must become political . This paradox is an enormous stumbling block to us . Our enemies use it to charge us with hypocrisy and those who should be our allies use it as an excuse not to fight . The former say we are just as political as they are , and the latter say that if we spend our time in fighting rather than in teaching and learning , then we have already lost . Both of these arguments are fallacious , just as it is a fallacy to suppose that a peaceful nation may not arm itself against warlike aggressors . Nevertheless , the paradox that underlies those arguments is not so easily dismissed , for it is subject to endless metamorphosis . No sooner have you rid yourself of it in one form than it reappears in another . <p> Consider , for example , the familiar plaint that opposition to politicization is right-wing politicization . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue goes well beyond the fact that politicization is currently from the Left . If that were all there is to it , then we could easily maintain that we oppose all politicization and not only its current leftist form . Furthermore , most of us would be saying that honestly , and few of those we want to convince would doubt that most of us are saying it honestly . But the issue is muddled by the fact that the Left -- I mean the academic Left , for what other Left is there today ? -- has adopted the thesis that all education is political . In consequence , any defense of unpoliticized education is ipso facto a rejection of leftist doctrine . The academic Left seems to have put us in the position of being unable to transcend politics . We either accept their politicization of the academy or , by opposing it , seek to place the academy in opposition to the Left , which , of course , is to politicize it . Deuced clever of them , what ? <p> But it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doctrine . They did not have to . The idea that all education and all scholarship is political does , of course , have its provenance in Marx 's idea of mystification . But it goes beyond that notion . Marx never said that every idea mystifies . Indeed , it is a corruption of Marxism to suppose that objectivity is impossible or that it is possible only after one has taken a political stance . For Marx himself sought to establish his views by rational argument based in part on historical data . Once upon a time , the Left thought it could win in a fair fight : by facts and by logic , it could win to its own view all those who were not mystified or self-serving . Only in the 1960s did a segment of the Left , namely , the New Left , decide to immunize itself from criticism by holding that everything is political , so that any inconvenient fact or argument could be dismissed as " reactionary . " ( In this , the New Left echoed in doctrine the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following every twist and turn of the Moscow-dictated party line . But evil practice is one thing , its justification in theory is another . ) <p> Thus , in opposing politicization , we do not reject leftist doctrine per se . Rather , we reject only the current debased form of leftism . And besides , rejecting a view as ground for academic practice is not inconsistent with giving that view a fair hearing within the academy . In fact , in the present case , the doctrine can not be fairly considered except by not acting upon it ( just as one can not simultaneously practice suicide and think about whether suicide is a good idea ) . For the serious examination of any view is possible only if ( 1 ) objectivity is possible and ( 2 ) we are trying to be objective ; but the idea that all education is political denies ( 1 ) and sanctions the violation of ( 2 ) . It follows that sincere radicals -- those who believe in the truth of what they espouse -- will join with us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall We Defend ? <p> What idea of liberal education joins the Jesuit and the atheist heir of the Enlightenment , the Orthodox Jew and the Fundamentalist Christian , the libertarian and the socialist in a common cause to save the academy ? I think an answer can be found in the history of liberal education , in the fact that a tradition that began in pagan Greece proved essential to the Christian universities of the Middle Ages and to secular education in modern democracies . For this suggests the existence of some common core that can be conceptualized and used in a variety of quite different ways and yet is identifiably the same thing . <p> The Pythagoreans believed that the study of mathematics liberated souls from their bodily prisons ; it did so because the truths revealed therein were universal and neither served any particular party 's self-interest nor depended on any particular person 's perspective . Thus Proclus credited that sect with creating liberal studies . The same ideal of impartiality is implicit in a religion that claims to be universal , not tribal . The Christian scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , in however subordinate a role , the liberal arts continue to serve that end and thus formed , and form , the body of Christian education . Nor is it any accident that modern democracies have fostered the liberal arts . For they , too , despite -- or because of -- their emphasis on individual liberty , depend on a general understanding of the impartial rule of law and of rights deemed universal . Without such an understanding , a democracy will degenerate into an unlimited , unmediated , unmitigated warfare of special interests . <p> Therefore , liberation from limited perspective , granted to us by the acquisition of objective knowledge and by the development of our rational faculties , is the goal of liberal education and makes that education valuable in a variety of contexts . We can disagree about whether a liberal education is complete if divorced from theological instruction ; we can disagree about whether moral teaching must be part of it or must be left merely as a hoped-for consequence of strictly mental training ; but we have to agree that knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves lead to or in conjunction with other things support that self-transcendence without which life is less than human . It is perhaps needless to add that low intellectual standards and politicization are the two wicked arrows that could penetrate liberal education 's heart and kill it . This is especially true of that contemporary form of politicization which teaches that one 's sex or race or class determines one 's " perspective " or " values " or " culture " -- for this is the very denial of the possibility of self-transcendence . <p> As the needs of a democracy are those that will be most generally acknowledged in our society , let us look more closely at liberal education in their light . One frequent criticism of the traditional curriculum is that it is elitist , and that a more democratic curriculum would give equal treatment to the contributions and cultures of all of America 's , or even the world 's , subgroups . I will ignore the problem that there is an enormous number of ways in which millions of people can be subdivided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far more important is the fact that the traditional curriculum was indeed designed for an elite group , and that it is therefore precisely the curriculum most needed by today 's democratic citizenry . To begin , again , with the ancient Greeks , liberal studies were those deemed suitable to the gentlemen of leisure whose only responsibility was to take a leading role in their polis . By teaching them a larger view of things and to think for themselves , it prepared them to rule . Since in our democracy the franchise is widespread , that same sort of education must also be widespread . In a democracy it is elitist no ! to make " elitist " education widely accessible . <p> Let us take military , political , and diplomatic history as an example , since that is so often invidiously compared to the " more democratic " social history . Social history , fascinating and valuable as that is , does not teach the art of statesmanship , of which the democratic citizen needs some understanding . It is far less useful to women and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to learn how to rule , which means studying what has been done by rulers , especially those of societies most like our own ; and those rulers have been , primarily , white males . It is a tendentious oversimplification , typical of present-day politicization , to suppose that former ruling classes were merely racist and sexist and that we have nothing to learn from them of prudence , statecraft , and practical wisdom . <p> The new , " multicultural " curriculum is not a curriculum for free men and women , prepared to take control of their own futures . It is , instead , a curriculum for those who will remain slaves to their origins , to their sex , race , age , class , handicap , or other peculiarity . It is , thus , inimical to democracy . So , too , is the related devotion of educational institutions to reforming students ' attitudes . In the first place , that really is elitist and antidemocratic , since it means that a self-selected group of educators has decided for all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Worse yet , it interferes with the transference of knowledge and development of mental skills that is essential to democratic citizenship . A democracy is in peril when its citizens can not think for themselves . Finally , the social reform motive serves as a welcome mat for politicization . If higher education is to perform its true service to democracy , it must drop the project of directly reforming society and return to the task of improving the minds of our young . <p> In conclusion , I think we can agree that the liberal arts tradition we defend is characterized most fundamentally by its quest for objective knowledge , both of historical and cultural peculiarities and of universal principles . Such knowledge lifts us out of the prison houses of our individual selves and peculiar conditions , making morality and democracy possible and supplementing the teachings of universalistic religions . Without this knowledge , partly achieved and partly hoped-for , unanswered questions can not be examined impartially nor taken seriously .

##4001472 A review of five measures of cognitive style suggested three underlying dimensions despite differences in the terminology and theoretical bases of these instruments . Consequently , factor analytic methods were used on five measures completed by a sample of 143 students and faculty : the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator , Gregorc Style Delineator , Decision Style Indicator , Learning Style Inventory , and Lifescripts . Results of this analysis identified three underlying factors consistent with predictions , i.e. , a thinking/feeling dimension , an information-processing domain , and an attentional focus dimension . Implications for future psychometric research are discussed . <p> There has been longstanding interest within the behavioral sciences in developing typologies of behavior . Such classification systems have been developed in such areas as personality ( Jung , 1923 ) , learning styles ( e.g. , Gregorc , 1982a ; Kolb , 1976 ) , decision-making styles ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) and social styles ( Christensen , 1980 ; Merrill &; Reid , 1981 ) . Moreover , these various schemes reflect the work of both theoretical and applied researchers in such fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there appears to be little integration across these fields regarding consistent similarities among various classification systems . Examination of such regularities may indeed help elucidate underlying theoretical processes/and or mechanisms ; consequently the purpose of the present study was to examine the conceptual similarity among five different taxonomies of cognitive behavior . Using factor analytic methods , we demonstrate the consistent overlap among these systems and argue for the existence of three primary dimensions of cognitive operation . It is important to emphasize that this work is not meant to be an evaluation , per se , of the quality of the particular measures used to create these taxonomies , but rather , an examination of the implications of the confluence of the models . REVIEW OF FIVE MODELS <p> We begin by reviewing the five models and then present the logic of our conceptual synthesis . Our review requires the explication of the key dimensions of each system ; to aid the reader , we have presented in Tables 1 and 2 the proposed conceptual equivalences among the five . We begin with a discussion of Jung 's model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1923,1971 ) theory of personality types rests upon three orthogonal , bipolar dimensions ( a ) a perceiving dimension , which is concerned with the ways we initially process information ; ( b ) a judging dimension , which characterizes decision-making ; and ( c ) an attentional dimension , which defines preferences for internal versus external focus . One end of the perceiving scale , termed Sensation , is practical , realistic , and present-oriented . Sensing types prefer facts , details , and structure . The opposite perceiving approach , Intuition , reflects a greater concern for meanings and implications rather than raw facts , and with patterns , rather than details . Intuitive types are imaginative and able to quickly recognize relationships in data . <p> Judging is accomplished either by Thinking , the term Jung used to denote an objective , logic-oriented mode of evaluation , or by Feeling , which is more personal and value-oriented . Individuals with a strong Thinking orientation tend to value control while those who lean toward Feeling generally prefer collaboration . <p> Jung also defined two opposing attentional preferences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gives more attention to the internal mental process . <p> Jung 's framework is the theoretical foundation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) ( Myers &; McCaulley , 1985 ) , an instrument widely used in counseling , educational , and industrial environments . Myers and Briggs introduced an additional dimension , called Judging-Perceiving , which describes an individual 's preference for organizing or controlling one 's external environment ( judging ) or for understanding these events ( perceiving ) . ( This was not one of Jung 's original dimensions ; moreover , we do not explicitly deal with this dimension in our study . ) <p> Several researchers , e.g. , Hellriegel and Slocum ( 1975 ) , McCaulley ( 1987 ) , have defined a 2 x 2 problem solving/cognitive style matrix by crossing Jung 's perceiving and judging dimensions , i.e. , Sensation/Thinking , Sensation/Feeling , Intuition/Thinking , and Intuition/Feeling . The utility of this taxonomy has been demonstrated in organizational studies of preferred organizational climate ( Mitroff &; Kilman. 1975 ) and executive decision-making ( McKenney &; Keen , 1974 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is the work of Gregorc ( 1982a , 1982b ) whose four learning style categories are based upon the crossing of sequential or random processing ( dimension 1 ) with concrete or abstract data ( dimension 2 ) . In his theory , " concrete " refers to the immediate experience of new information , no matter how it is dealt with , while " abstract " refers to the mental representation of the experience . Gregorc 's four styles are summarized by Butler ( 1988 ) as follows : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The preceding description of the Concrete Sequential can be applied to Jung 's Sensation type while the adjectives describing the Abstract Sequential are appropriate for the Thinking type . The Abstract Random description is quite suitable for Feeling types while Intuitives can easily be associated with the Concrete Random learning style . While no studies have directly compared MBTI types with those measured by the Gregorc Style Delineator ( 1982b ) , they have been linked in separate studies involving a third measure , the Kirton Adaptation/Innovation Inventory . <p> Kirton ( 1976 ) proposed two problem-solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work within the existing situation to solve a problem and tend to be practical , methodical , and conforming . Innovators , on the other hand , question all aspects of a problem , approach it from new angles and challenge rules . <p> Kirton 's descriptions generally coincide with Myers ' ( 1987 , p. 5 ) description of Sensing types who " ... accept and work with what is ' given ' in the here-and-now , and thus become realistic and practical " and Intuitives who " ... grow expert at seeing new possibilities and new ways of doing things . " Indeed , Carne and Kirton ( 1982 ) found significant correlations between Intuitives and Innovators and between Sensates and Adaptors . Joniak and Isaksen ( 1988 ) compared the Kirton and Gregorc instruments and found that Adaptors corresponded to Concrete Sequentials and Innovators to Concrete Randoms . The results of these two studies support the Jung/Gregorc parallel summarized in Table 1 . <p> Additional evidence of the parallelism between the Gregorc and MBTI systems can be seen in the response profiles of men and women taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored significantly higher on the Abstract Sequential channel while females scored higher on the Abstract Random channel . Both genders were predominantly Concrete Sequential . Similarly , Myers and McCaulley ( 1985 ) report that on the MBTI males are most often classified as Thinking types ( parallel to Gregorc 's Abstract Sequential ) while most females are typed as Feeling ( Abstract Random ) , and there are many more Sensates ( corresponding to Concrete Sequential ) in the general population than there are Intuitives ( Concrete Random ) . Thus data from the Kirton Inventory , as well as gender differences in response patterns to the two measures , suggest the similarity between MBTI and Gregorc " types . " Decision Style Inventory <p> Rowe 's Decision Style Inventory ( DSI ) ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) has its conceptual foundation in his earlier work with Driver ( Driver &; Rowe , 1979 ) on the use of information in decision making and idea generation . His model is based upon the dimensions of cognitive complexity and environmental complexity . The first term reflects an individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for people- ( vs. task- ) oriented work environment . The four styles derived from this model are : Directive , Analytic , Conceptual , and Behavioral . <p> The Directive Style reflects a practical , present-oriented approach . Directives are autocratic , action-oriented , and prefer structure . Analytics are logical , task-oriented , abstract thinkers . The Conceptual style is associated with creativity , insight , and intuition . Behaviorals are people-oriented , supportive , and receptive . Kolb 's Learning Style Inventory <p> Kolb 's ( 1984 ) learning cycle model represents another conceptual approach to classifying cognitive processing . Based largely on Piaget , Kolb uses the terms abstract and concrete differently than does Gregorc , relating them to Jung 's Thinking and Feeling dimensions . Kolb states that " An orientation toward abstract conceptualization focuses on using logic , ideas , and concepts . It emphasizes thinking as opposed to feeling " while " An orientation toward concrete experience focuses on being involved in experiences and dealing with human situations in a personal way . It emphasizes feeling as opposed to thinking " ( pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning theory is that of active experimentation versus reflective observation . In one of the several perspectives that Kolb offers on his theory of learning , he describes his two dimensions respectively as one of grasping information and one of transforming it . Grasping is accomplished by either apprehension ( concrete experience ) or comprehension ( abstract conceptualization ) . The two forms of transformation are extension ( " active external manipulation , " p. 41 ) and intention ( " internal reflection , " p. 41 ) . Kolb specifically relates intention to introversion and extension to extraversion . <p> Kolb 's four styles are defined by the intersection of his two dimensions . Convergers favor abstract conceptualization and active experimentation while Divergers emphasize reflective observation and concrete experience . Accommodators value active experimentation and concrete experience , while Assimilators prefer abstract conceptualization and reflective observation . <p> Comparing his Learning Style Inventory ( LSI ) and the MBTI , Kolb ( 1976 ) noted " The strongest and most consistent relationships appear to be between concrete/abstract LSI and feeling/thinking MBTI and between active/reflective LSI and extrovert/introvert MBTI " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning styles relate to the extraverted and introverted aspects of the Thinking/Feeling scale . Lifescripts <p> The last measure considered is Christensen 's ( 1980 ) Lifescripts . Designed for use in management consulting , the scale defines four styles ( Analyzer , Controller , Supporter , and Promoter ) that Christensen relates to social interaction rather than cognitive functions . Nevertheless , the authors believe that such styles , as described as follows by Christensen , do , in fact , reflect cognitive variations in the way people use information whether they are in social situations or performing more clearly cognitive tasks . Moreover , we see definite parallels between this taxonomy and the Thinking/Feeling and **25;441;TOOLONG dimensions of the MBTI . <p> According to Christensen , " Controllers want results . They are very task oriented and will make sure the job gets done " ( p. 3 ) . They " ... like to direct and coordinate the work of others " ( p. 3 ) . Myers and Myers ( 1980 , p. 85 ) tell us that " Extraverted Thinkers use their thinking to run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and " ... they enjoy deciding what ought to be done and giving appropriate orders to ensure that it will be done . " <p> Introverted Thinking types , like Analyzers , are logical and reserved . They " use their thinking to analyze the world , not run it " ( p. 89 ) . Extraverted Feeling types are friendly , tactful , sympathetic , and like dealing with people , while Promoters are described as gregarious , outgoing , and socially skillful . Introverted Feeling types are idealistic , loyal , and " value , above all , harmony " ( p. 97 ) . Supporters are also characterized as idealistic and loyal and " ... will try to keep conflict low in order to maintain harmony " ( Christensen , 1980 , p. 2 ) . <p> It should be noted that Lifescripts represents only one of a considerable number of style measures developed for consulting purposes ; cf. Life Orientations Survey ( Atkins , 1981 ) , The Self Profile ( DeVille , 1984 ) , and Social Style Profile ( Merrill &; Reid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in Bokoros ( 1989 ) . <p> We have considered five conceptual models of style relevant to cognition and noted their similarities ( see Tables 1 and 2 ) . We consider it significant that these pronounced similarities exist despite their differences in conceptual development , domains of application , specific item content and the response format of the measures . Jung based his typology upon observations made in the course of his clinical practice ; Gregorc and Kolb studied learning in the academic environment ; while Rowe and Christensen drew from work done in the industrial environment . <p> The similarity that exists among the systems suggests that the five measures may all be tapping into a single , consistent conceptual framework . Indeed , we hypothesize that a factor analysis of these five measures ( see also Table 3 ) will lead to the emergence of three factors : Factor 1 -- An executive cognitive function charged with controlling cognitive operations and arriving at decisions ; Factor 2 -- A receiving function ordering and encoding sensory input ; and Factor 3 -- An activating function determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a close relationship with Factor 1 . <p> Finally , we believe that factors 1 and 2 operate along bipolar dimensions analogous to serial and parallel processing . METHOD <p> The instruments used in this study were the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ( MBTI ) , the Learning Style Inventory ( LSI ) , the Gregorc Style Delineator ( GSD ) , the Decision Style Inventory ( DSI ) , and Lifescripts ( LFS ) . <p> The MBTI and LSI are relatively well-known instruments with documented psychometric integrity ( see Carlson , 1985 ; Carlyn , 1977 ; Myers and McCaulley , 1985 ; Thompson and Borello , 1986 , MBTI ; Freedman and Stumpf , 1978 ; Geller , 1978 ; Kolb , 1976 , 1981,1984 , LSI . ) Consequently , we will examine the latter three measures . <p> The GSD ( Gregorc , 1982a , 1982b ) presents the respondent with 10 sets of 4 words . In each set , the individual is asked to rank order the words in terms of how well they describe the respondent . Gregorc ( 1982b ) describes test-retest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct validity ( positive correlations between GSD style types and endorsement of 40 characteristics theoretically consistent with the types ) ; nevertheless , the psychometric soundness of the GSD does not appear to be well-documented . <p> The Decision Style Inventory ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) involves choosing from a set of four phrases the best ending to a sentence . Twenty sentences and word phrases are presented . Rowe ( Rowe &; Mason , 1987 ) reports significant split-half validity for his measure and reliable correlations between the DSI and other well-known measures- the MBTI , the LSI , and the Embedded Figures Test ( Witkin , Oltman , Raskin &; Karp , 1971 ) -but presents no actual data in his book . Finally , Christensen 's ( 1980 ) Lifescripts consists of 18 sentence completion items with four choices each to be ranked in order of how descriptive they are of the subject . The first six sentences are questions about a hypothetical autobiography ; the next six refer to a movie based on the book ; and the final six relate to critical responses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reported data on either the validity or reliability of the measure . <p> Although the last three measures do not have well-established reliability and validity , this does not present a particular difficulty in terms of the focus of our study , which is on the convergence of these measures . Indeed , the extent to which the measures are not psychometrically sound should just add random " noise " to the analysis and work against any convergence of factors . <p> The five measures were administered to 180 students and faculty members at Central Connecticut State University . One hundred and sixty-two of the subjects correctly completed all five measures . The data were then screened for outliers , skewness , and multivariate normality following procedures described by Tabatchnik and Fidell ( 1989 ) . The final sample of 143 individuals had a mean age of 32 years with a range of 17 to 72 . A variety of majors was reported , but most of the participants were from psychology , education , and business disciplines . <p> To prepare the data for factor analysis , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This transformation did not distort the meaning of the scales but allowed for more direct interpretation of the factor analysis in terms of the hypothesized factor alignment . For the MBTI , the dimensions were E/I S/N , T/F , J/P ( see Myers &; McCaulley , 1985 ) . On the LSI , we labeled CE - AC as LSI1 and AE - RO as LS12 . The dimensions of the GSD were defined as GSD1 = Abstract Random Abstract Sequential , and GSD2 = Concrete Random - Concrete Sequential , while for the DSI , dimensions were computed as DSI1 = Behavioral - Analytic , and DSI2 = Conceptual - Directive . <p> Computing continuous dimensions for Lifescripts was more complex since the instrument asked for responses under both normal and " adverse " conditions ( i.e. , negative reviews of the book and movie about their life ) . Since this division was not needed for our study , responses for a given item were combined into a single score for each type . The SP ( Supporter ) and PM ( Promoter ) scores were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obtained by combining AN ( Analyzer ) with CT ( Controller ) . Subtracting Task from People produced the scale , LFS1 , that we believe is associated with the MBTI 's T/F . The extraversion score ( CT + PM ) was subtracted from the introversion score ( AN + SP ) to obtain LFS2 . <p> The continuous scores were subjected to a principal factor analysis using varimax rotation ( SAS , 1985 ) . The specific factor alignment predicted is shown in Table 3 . RESULTS <p> A complete intercorrelation matrix of all variables is available from the authors . The pattern of correlations was generally consistent with predictions with the exception of the LSl 's AE and RO . Neither showed any meaningful association with Introversion or Extraversion . AE did show a small correlation with Sensation , and RO with Feeling . We also found that the GSD 's Sequential scores were significantly correlated with Introversion and the Random scores with Extraversion . <p> Kaiser 's Measure of Sampling Adequacy ( Kaiser , 1970 ) was 0.78 , exceeding the 0.6 threshold recommended by Tabatchnik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three factors , which account for 100% of the common variance , were retained . The eigenvalues were : 3.163 , 1.670 , and 0.854 , respectively . The inclusion of the third factor with an eigenvalue less than one was based on inspection of the scree plot ( see Tabachnick &; Fidell , 1989 , p. 635 ) . The factor loadings after varimax rotation are shown in Table 4 . <p> Loadings exceeding 0.55 , Comrey 's ( 1973 ) criteria for " good " factors , are enclosed in parentheses . As can be seen , the alignment of the dimensions coincides very well with our theoretical predictions . DISCUSSION <p> The findings support our hypothesis in nearly every respect . Factor1 represents a decision-making function : convergent and objective at one pole ; divergent and subjective at the other . It appears to play a supervisory role in cognitive functioning . Factor2 represents a basic data-processing orientation : at one extreme immediacy , accuracy , and applicability ; at the other patterns and possibilities . Factor3 consists of the MBTI **25;468;TOOLONG scale and a similar scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to external stimuli or to one 's own thoughts and ideas . While Kolb 's theory approaches this factor from a purely cognitive standpoint ( as opposed to Christensen 's emphasis on the social environment ) his active/reflective dimension failed to load on this factor , or any other . This may reflect more on the instrument per se than on Kolb 's learning theory . In our opinion one end of his scale relates to pragmatism , rather than to activity , and the other end to a preference for passive learning , which is not necessarily reflective . <p> All of the instruments , including the LSI , load successfully on Factor1 , the decisionmaking dimension . Lifescripts combines this dimension with Factor3 ( Introversion/ Extraversion ) . The " social " styles defined by this instrument apparently reflect the internal and external application of the executive cognitive function . <p> The pattern of results is also consistent with certain neurophysiological data regarding brain functions . Luria ( 1966,1970,1973 ) , based on research into functional deficiencies resulting from localized brain damage , postulated three primary structures he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 66 ) . The first block ( brain stem , reticular formation , and hippocampus ) , relates principally to arousal ( see also Eysenck , 1967 ) ; the second block ( temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes ) deals with encoding of information ; while the third block ( frontal lobes ) is concerned with planning and decision-making . <p> The three blocks appear to have direct functional correspondence to the MBTI , i.e. , block one with **25;495;TOOLONG , block two with sensation/ intuition and block three with thinking/feeling . The remaining four models show parallels with two of the three blocks . Both Gregorc and Rowe describe functions related to encoding ( block two ) and decision-making ( block three ) while Kolb 's and Christensen 's measures both consider functions akin to attentional focus ( block one ) and decision making ( block three ) . <p> What are the implications of our results ? We believe that the convergence of the five instruments , containing in total 28 separate cognitive/behavioral indices , into three bipolar dimensions argues for the fundamentality of these dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual measures in their appropriate applications , a focus on the underlying cognitive processes may result in the development of new measures ( or the simplification of existing ones ! ) that have greatly expanded utility and applicability . Moreover , such research may inform neurophysiological work examining the chemical and biological bases of cognitive behavior . We believe that future psychometric research should examine the commonalities among psychological measures and their implications for underlying psychological processes rather than adding to the continued proliferation of instruments of limited applicability .

##4001474 No gender differences appeared in personality ratings of aggression/assertiveness when separate rating scales were used to rate extensive interview and test material on elderly women and men . Men were rated significantly lower in aggression on a scale created to rate women than on a scale created to rate men , and men tended to be rated as less aggressive than women on the female scale . For women , aggression was apparent in their accounts of current activities , while in men aggression was more often apparent in their renditions of past-life activities . Gender differences were most apparent in verbal aggression in interpersonal interactions . Findings are consistent with the possibility of age-related decline in aggression in men . <p> This study explored gender differences in old age in personality ratings of aggression/assertiveness along with patterns of apparent change in aggression from middle to old age . A perennial issue in adult development and aging is mean-level personality change from middle to old age , in which men become less , and women more , aggressive ( Turner , 1982 ) . Longitudinal research using objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait aggression ( Costa &; McCrae , 1980 ) , while research on self-concepts ( Bengtson , Reedy , &; Gordon , 1985 ) indicates more , and research using projective tests ( Gutmann , 1977 ) suggests still more , differential personality change in aggression for women and men . <p> In the present study , ratings of aggression were made from lengthy structured interviews and test materials . In this study , aggression is defined as action which is carried out in a forceful way to achieve ends . High aggression refers to a high level of assertiveness and goal-directedness to push toward a goal despite obstacles . A high level of hostility or overt anger does not necessarily indicate high assertiveness . At the low end of the scale , the individual is not assertive ; hostility may be suppressed or covertly expressed , but the individual is withdrawn and nonassertive ( Turner , 1969 , p. 123 ) . <p> When such data were initially analyzed , Turner ( 1969 ) created and used separate five-point scales for male and female respondents to rate aggression , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed somewhat from those in women ; but , more important , examination of the interview and test protocols gave Turner the impression that men in this sample were , in general , less aggressive than women ( Turner , 1969 , p. 125 ) . Separate scales were created to control for these apparent gender differences , and , using the two separate scales , men and women did not differ in aggression . <p> But were the women in that sample indeed more aggressive than men ? To answer this question , men and women must be rated on the same scale . In the present , secondary analysis , aggression in male respondents was again rated , using the scale devised for rating women . Two comparisons were made . First , ratings of male respondents on the scale created in 1968 to rate men were compared to ratings of male respondents on the scale created in 1968 to rate women ; second , ratings of male respondents on the latter scale were compared to those of female respondents on the same scale . It was hypothesized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale than on the male scale , and that men would be rated as less aggressive than women when both genders were rated on the female scale . METHOD Sample <p> The sample consisted of 85 elderly Jewish persons ( 60 women and 25 men ) who were interviewed while on the waiting list for admission to one of three homes for the aged . The age range was 63-91 years old ( M = 78 years ) ; all respondents were born before the turn of the twentieth century . All respondents were ambulatory , free of major incapacitating illnesses , and showed no gross signs of altered brain function as defined by poor performance on several cognitive measures ( Turner , Tobin , &; Lieberman , 1972 ) . There were no gender differences in cognitive status ( Turner , 1969 ) or physical and functional capacity ( Tobin , 1990 ) . Data <p> A basic battery of instruments and focused interviews was administered to all respondents . This battery consisted of 18 structured instruments and 9 focused interview sections , administered in 4 to 6 sessions totalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made six types of judgment on each respondent after completing the interview . <p> Turner ( 1969 ) developed a definition for the construct " aggression " and devised five-point scales to rate aggression as a personality trait in men and women separately ; scales were constructed to distribute the sample evenly among the five points . Scale points shown below were devised to rate women , and in the present analysis were used to rate both genders . <p> Scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate women , and in 1990 , men also : Very Low Aggression . Respondent denies assertiveness in almost every instance , seeming instead to withdraw . Respondent seems unable to assert self , even in situations in which interpersonal conflict would not occur . Respondent may appear " helpless " or apathetic . Personal characteristics include : Respondent is a very quiet , compliant , unobtrusive person who places or has always placed others ' needs before own needs ; respondent represses own needs to propitiate others , is subservient ; Respondent is verbal and friendly to the interviewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; is timid and fears own decisions , so defers to those of relatives , or " gives in " so as to avoid confrontations and denies anger or expresses helplessness ; and Respondent despairs of influencing others and has withdrawn , feels helpless . Respondent may seem actually afraid of the interviewer . Low Aggression . Respondent is generally a very mild person , but on occasion goes after things despite being most uncomfortable in situations involving interpersonal conflict . Or respondent seems never to go after things directly , but instead manipulates others in a passive fashion to supply needs . Respondent may use martyrdom and whining as weapons , but at the same time conveys impotence in influencing others and an inability to follow through in an assertive manner . Rather than mildness , respondent may convey strong anxiety with consequent withdrawing tendencies and a strong wish to avoid trouble that is then acted on . Moderate Aggression . Respondent is not particularly assertive , but focuses considerable hostility outward , so may angrily tell others off . Respondent has much potential for interpersonal conflict that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very domineering in one or two relationships within the family circle , but is markedly fearful of ( and thus avoidant of , or deferent to ) nonfamily figures . Or , respondent 's aggressivity has a metered quality and is appropriately expressed ( but is not sufficiently intrusive/dominant to be rated a 4 ) . High Aggression . Respondent is very goal-directed in certain areas of life ; may be tough and argumentative , but is occasionally unsure of self and withdraws . Respondent is somewhat domineering ; or tends to assume leadership roles and actively assumes responsibility in social situations , but is not as intrusive/dominant as a 5 . Or , a mild , unobtrusive front covers an ability to assume control of people and social situations , so that respondent is strongly directive and powerful without seeming to be so . Very High Aggression . Respondent runs everything , takes over ; is a leader . Respondent may pop off unrestrainedly at every opportunity ; has a never-say-die attitude and is a formidable opponent . May manipulate people but in an active , commandeering , openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an iron-willed dictator who compels deference . Respondent is instantly prepared to fight for own rights in almost any situation . Highly intrusive . <p> For the purpose of comparison , scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate men in 1968 are shown below . The scale point definitions for personality ratings of aggression used to rate men in 1968 were : Very Low Ageression . Respondent may be extroverted or very quiet , but in either case he expresses impotence and helplessness in interpersonal conflicts ; e.g. , if his child says something mean to him , he cries , or feels he must " take it . " The interviewer may remark that he is especially mild-mannered , passive , and subservient . He is " broken . " He has a strong self-image of noncompetitiveness and unobtrusiveness ; he views himself as a man who " never argues . " Low Aggression . Respondent seems to do his very best to avoid conflict , but irritation slips through . He may be apathetic and humble but manipulates others . In his job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have an " underdog " air . Moderate Aggression . Respondent is easily irritated , agitated , and negativistic , but he deals with these feelings by isolating himself . He is a quiet man , but he has a stubborn streak . At present , he seems to be a quiet , even a passive man , but in earlier life he seemed to display decided masculine-assertive characteristics ; e.g. , he reveled in his superordinate position as foreman in which he directed the work of many other men ; or he once loved to participate in competitive sports . In general , he has a potential for conflict although he prefers to avoid it . High Aggression . Respondent was quite competitive in his business and took on many organizational activities and responsibilities . Often he has been a " doer " and still tries to control others . He is occasionally quite irascible , or he may be an egotist who persistently seeks to be the center of attention . Although he may express some timidity about crossing others , he will stand up for his rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbally aggressive or is quarrelsome and maintains a masculine-aggressive pose ; he is forceful and may even be physically aggressive , or he was when younger . He was , and still tries to be , dominant over others . Or , he is an egotist who takes on organizational responsibilities as well as relentlessly seeking a limelight . RESULTS <p> The mean score for women on the rating scale for aggression created in 1968 for rating women , M = 2.98 , SD = 1.44 , was almost identical to the mean score for men on the rating scale created in 1968 for rating aggression in men , M = 3.0O , SD = 1.26 . A second rater , unaware of the specific hypotheses of this study , rated 13 female and 18 male protocols on the female and male scales , respectively ; interjudge reliability ( product-moment correlations ) for female cases was .86 and for male cases , .93 . <p> Next , all 25 male cases were rated on the aggression scale created for rating women , M = 2.44 , SD = 1.00 . Interjudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale was .95 . Thirteen of the 25 men ( 52% ) were rated as less aggressive on this scale than they were rated on the scale for men . No men were rated as more aggressive on the female scale than on the male scale . It should be noted that 4 of the 25 men had received the lowest possible rating on aggression on the male scale , and therefore could be rated no lower on the female scale . Hence , of the 21 men who might have been rated lower on the female than on the male scale , 62% ( n = 13 ) were so rated . Men were rated as significantly less aggressive on the female scale than they were on the male scale , t(24) = 4.80 , p <.001 . <p> Finally , ratings of men and women were compared on the scale created for rating women . On the aggression scale devised for rating women , men ( M = 2.44 ) tended to be rated as less aggressive than were women , M = 2.98 , t(83) = 1.71 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study provide partial support for the hypothesis that men ( in this sample of Jewish elderly ) were less aggressive than women . Although half of the men were rated as less aggressive on the scale created for rating women than they were on the scale devised for rating men , and although this difference is significant , mean ratings for the two genders on the female scale failed to reach significance at the .05 level . <p> Gender differences were especially apparent above the midpoint of the scale . Twenty percent of the women , but none of the men , received the highest rating ( 5 ) on the female scale . Analysis indicated that , for women , the presence or absence of forceful goal-directed action was generally apparent in their accounts of current activities . For men , in contrast , the presence of forceful action was more often rated on the basis of their renditions of past-life , especially occupational activities . Occupational life and , for some , organizational activities and competitive sports , provided the context for male assertiveness . Organizational activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context for highly assertive women , but gender differences were particularly apparent in the expression of verbal assertiveness in interpersonal situations . Among men , verbal aggression often appeared as irritability ; assertive women , in contrast , were more zestfully direct in verbal aggression and more forceful in their attempts to achieve their goals in interpersonal contexts . These gender differences in the expression of aggression were not accounted for by differences in physical status ; the women and men in this sample were comparable in health status ( Tobin , 1990 ) . The gender differences in manifestations of aggression in this study are similar to the gender differences in expression of ego mastery style found in projective test responses of elderly . Gutmann ( 1964 ) reported that women tended to view conflicts as interpersonal , or deployed aggression directly , while men were more likely to struggle against an impersonal environment , or were unable to act instrumentally to reach their goals . <p> These data are cross-sectional , and it can not unambiguously be concluded that the men in this sample are less aggressive than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with such an interpretation . The mechanism for such a change , if it occurs , remains unclear in these data . Gutmann 's socioevolutionary model ( 1977,1987 ) is the most comprehensive approach to gender differentiation across the life span in personality traits such as aggression ( Huyck , 1990 ) . Gutmann has proposed that aggression in younger men has evolved in response to the demands of parenting ; when the offspring are no longer vulnerable and in need of support , men are free to become less aggressive . <p> Another suggestion is that occupational life provides a normative context for male aggression across many cohorts in our society , such that assertiveness dwindles when the occupational context is unavailable to men in old age . Intimate interactions , in contrast , form the normative context for female aggression , at least among the elderly cohorts thus far studied . Aggression , in other words , may be somewhat situation-specific for each gender . In this sample , however , assertive old women were more likely to be directly aggressive in public " impersonal " contexts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were in " private " interpersonal interactions . <p> The findings of this study are consistent , then , with the possibility of age-related decline in aggression in men . It also appears that the old men studied are indeed somewhat less aggressive than are the old women , at least when aggression , defined as forceful goal-directed action , is rated from extensive interview and test materials . ( In contrast , studies using objective personality tests such as the Guildford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey find large gender differences in the expected direction on masculine-associated scales Costa , McCrae , &; Arenberg , 1983 ) . <p> Because aggression in women in this study was readily rated on the basis of current activities , there is no way of estimating stability or change in level of aggression among women . Whether women increase in aggression from middle to old age remains an open question in these data . <p> 
##4001476 A three-alternative forced choice forward masking procedure was embedded in an arcade-style rocketship video game . Human subjects were categorized into five groups adults and 5- , 6- , 7- , and 8-year-old children . The masker was a 500-msec noise that simulated rocket engines and the 20-msec , 500-Hz sinusoidal signal was a chirp from a gremlin . The gremlin hid , at random , in one of the three rockets . Subjects responded and interacted with the game by touching the rocket hiding the gremlin . Results revealed that masked thresholds decreased for all groups as a function of the interstimulus interval . The reliability of the psychophysical approach was confirmed and a developmental trend lends support to the hypothesis that auditory processing improves as a function of age . Children 's auditory filters were suggested to be functionally larger than those of adults . <p> A child 's perception of the world , like everyone 's , is a function of experience and innate sensory abilities . In this respect important and fundamental questions exist concerning a child 's sensory competence . It is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young child can lead to permanent perceptual impairment if the defect is not recognized and corrected . As a result , the need to evaluate and understand a child 's visual capability is important . Likewise , the auditory modality is a vital and significant window to the world . Indeed , normal hearing mechanisms are clearly functional well before birth and are vital to normal speech development ( e.g. , Bredberg , 1968 ; DeCasper and Fifer , 1980 ; Elliott et al. , 1979 ; Morrongiello , Kulig , &; Clifton , 1984 ) . <p> The present paper examines an essential auditory parameter , temporal processing , using young children . The choice of time as the variable of interest , rather than frequency or intensity , was based on intuition as well as empirical data . Investigators of infant and child hearing have labored diligently to provide important contributions to the development of frequency and intensity processing ( e.g. , Allen , Wightman , Kistler , &; Dolan , 1989 ; Aslin , 1989 ; Davis &; McCroskey , 1980 ; Irwin , Ball , Kay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Schade , 1986 ; Jensen , 1987 ; Morrongiello &; Trehub , 1987 ; Morrongiello , Kulig , &; Clifton , 1984 ; Nossa &; Wilson , -1984 ; Olsho , 1985 ; Soderquist &; Hoenigman , 1973 ; Soderquist &; Moore , 1970 ; Thorpe , Trehub , Morrongiello , &; Bull , 1988 ) . There is , however , no doubt that temporal patterns within acoustic events are equally vital to the normal unfolding of language , speech , and musical perception ( e.g. , Bailey , 1983 ; Elliott et al. , 1979 ; Elliott , Hammer , Scholl , &; Wasowicz , 1989 ; Nossa , Rossman , Bond , &; Miller , 1990 ; Studdert-Kennedy , 1975 ; Tallal , Stark , Kallman , &; Mellits , 1981 ; Trehub , 1987 ; Wightman , Allen , Dolan , Kistler , &; Jamieson , 1989 ) . Investigations that focus on the temporal parameter , use convergent methods , and control subject variability should generate significant information regarding auditory development in children . Our initial goal in this project was to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forward-masking paradigm . <p> Aside from the problem of children 's variability within psychophysical tasks ( which is addressed below ) , we were concerned about the development of the auditory system . We hypothesized that a child 's performance in a forward-masking task would be inferior to that of an adult . This is because recent data show that children 's auditory filters are larger than those of adults ( e.g. , Irwin et al. , 1986 ) . If the auditory filters are larger , they would be less efficient and less selective in funneling-out and removing extraneous sounds . The predicted result would be that children would have higher masked thresholds because of the decreased signal-to-noise ratio concomitant with large auditory filters . Signal detectability decreases as a function of increasing filter size ( the filter passes more noise and decreases the S/N ratio ) . When the temporal domain is examined , as in forward masking , one would expect the signal to be less detectable for children with large auditory filters . Further , one would expect that children of different ages would perform differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young children with large filters would be expected to have higher masked thresholds than older children and adults . Further , the functions should vary systematically as the interstimulus interval changes . These conjectures were examined in the present study . <p> The use of children in behavioral psychophysical tasks raises interesting and complex questions . It is well known that psychophysical tasks necessitate focused attention and careful following of verbal instructions . It is equally clear that one often encounters difficulties when young children are requested to be careful psychophysical observers . Some of the more obvious impediments are motivation , attention , restlessness , and just plain boredom . A request to sit quietly in a sound attenuated booth , push buttons , and attend to weird noise bursts and/or tone pips over earphones is not a child 's idea of fun . Under such conditions a child quickly becomes bored , disinterested , and inattentive to monotonous repetitive stimuli . If no effort is made to maintain a recalcitrant child 's curiosity and interest in the task , the data collected during even a short experimental session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the task ! ) . To overcome this obstacle an experimental technique has been developed , both in our laboratory and others ( e.g. , Abramov et al. , 1984 ; Allen et al. , 1989 ; Hall &; Grose , 1990 ; Jensen , Neff , &; Callaghan , 1987 ; Wightman et al. , 1989 ) , where a psychophysical technique is embedded within a computerized video game . This innovation allows investigators to focus on primary auditory processes while maintaining the child 's cooperation . The introduction of a touch screen system to replace button presses also appears to be a useful innovation . <p> There are several approaches to the investigation of auditory perception via the temporal parameter. 1 The rapid temporal shifts within the flow of fluent speech suggest forward masking as one promising avenue . The detection of a signal that is preceded by a masker is , in part , a function of the interstimulus interval ( ISI ) between the two stimuli ( Elliott , 1962 , 1971 ; Soderquist , Carstens , &; Frank , 1981 ) . Using forward masking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of a subject to detect a brief signal following a masker . METHODS Subjects <p> There were 25 subjects categorized into five equal sized age groups : 5 through 8 , and adults . Each subject had normal hearing and was examined by the University Speech and Hearing Center . Children were recruited from local day care centers and elementary schools . Adults were selected from faculty and students at the University . Brief Illustrative Procedure <p> On the day of the " game " the child was brought to the Auditory Perception Laboratory . Upon arrival he or she was shown toys and prizes that could be won by playing the game . After a short acclimation period , the child was allowed to enter the " game room " with one of the research assistants . The child sat at a table within the room . The child 's monitor , and a similar one outside the room for the experimenter , were interfaced with a microcomputer and a touch screen system . When the child entered the room , an introductory logo was on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " danced and " chirped " ( Figure 1a ) . The child and the research assistant put on matching earphones and listened to the gremlin while the instructions for the game were explained . Once the child understood the goal of the game , i.e. , to find the gremlin hiding in one of the rocketships , a practice game would begin . The game would start when the child touched the gremlin displayed on the monitor . When the game began , the visual image changed to that of three rocketships resting on launch pads . The child could hear each rocketship , in sequence , " test its engines " ( a noise burst ) . As each rocketship tested its engines , red flames would emanate from the rocket simultaneously with the noise burst ( Figure 1b ) . On each trial the gremlin would signal its hiding place by providing a chirp ( the signal ) immediately following one of the three noise bursts . Using the chirp as a cue , the child 's task was to touch the rocketship containing the gremlin ( Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment in the score shown on the screen and the emergence of the gremlin from the top of the rocket ( Figure 1d ) . The gremlin would chirp and zig-zag upward into the sky until , near the top of the screen , it would be vaporized with a laser beam and disappear with a bang ( the backfire of a Model-T Ford , near 60 dB SPL ) ( Figure 1e ) . If the subject made an error , the gremlin would appear briefly below the correct rocketship , dance , chirp three times and disappear ( Figure 1f ) . The game continued in this manner until the threshold for the signal was estimated by the 3AFC adaptive procedure ( Levitt , 1971 ) . At the completion of each game the rocketship would blast off for a new planet , the point total would appear , and a brief rest period was introduced . Each game lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes and averaged approximately 30-35 trials . Following the practice game , the experiment would begin and the child would play three games at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between games . With older children , the assistant often left the game room and the child played alone . In situations where the assistant remained in the room , he or she removed the earphones and sat silently behind or to the side of the subject . The subject 's performance was , in all cases , monitored via a one-way mirror . Adults played the same game and had the same practice . Apparatus and Stimuli <p> Each subject was seated in front of a Zenith VGA Multi-Sync monitor inside a double-walled chamber . Auditory stimuli were presented via matched earphones ( TDH-49 in supraural cushions ) . The video game was produced using Borland Turbo Pascal 4.0 and subject responses were recorded via an Elographics Touch Screen and controller . The signal was a digitally generated 500-Hz sinusoid using a sampling frequency of 25 kHz . The signal was converted by a Data Translations 2801-A D/A converter . The rise/fall of the signal ( the gremlin chirp ) was 5 msec . The total duration of the signal was 20 msec . The 500-msec analog noise , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision noise generator bandpassed ( 10-3kHz at 3 dB down ) through a 24 dB/oct Krohn-Hite 3100 adjustable filter . The noise spectrum level ( No ) was approximately 38 dB ( 73 dB SPL overall ) . The stimuli were mixed , amplified . and controlled using Coulbourn Instruments mixer/amplifiers ( S8224 ) , Coulbourn Instruments programmable attenuators ( S85-08 ) , and a Crown D-75 amplifier . Stimuli were monitored using a Tektronix storage scope ( SAISN amplifier and SL4N spectrum analyzer ) , Ballantine 320A true RMS meter , and Hewlett-Packard manual attenuators ( 350-D ) . Psychophysical procedure <p> A three-alternative forced choice psychophysical procedure ( 3AFC ) using a 2-down/ 1-up Levitt ( 1971 ) adaptive algorithm was embedded into the previously described video game . The algorithm provided a 71% correct detection at the masked threshold . <p> The interval between noise bursts ( inter-rocket interval ) was 500 msec . The interval between the noise offset and the signal onset ( ISI ) was either 10 , 30 , or 100 msec for each game . On each trial the 20-msec signal followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject indicated their decision by touching the rocket where the gremlin was thought to be hiding . The signal level varied according to the 2-down/1-up algorithm ( Levitt , 1971 ) . If the subject made two consecutive correct responses , the signal intensity decreased . The signal level increased for each incorrect response . An individual game was terminated after eight turn-arounds . A turn-around occurred whenever the signal intensity changed from increasing to decreasing , or vice-versa . The signal level changed in 4-dB steps for the first three turn-arounds and in 2-dB steps thereafter . The masked threshold for each game was based on the signal intensity at each of the last five turn-arounds . The final datum , for each ISI , was obtained by deriving the mean from the thresholds of three consecutive games . The order of ISI was counterbalanced as much as possible across subjects . The signal intensity for the first game was always at 60-dB SPL . The beginning signal level for the following two games was determined by randomly adding between 10 to 19 dB to the signal threshold obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , and 4 show , for representative subjects , signal level as a function of trial number . Figure 2 displays the results for a 5-year-old in the left column , and a 6-year-old on the right . Figure 3 shows data for the 7- and 8-year-old groups . Figure 4 shows the performance of two adults . Each column displays three games at each of the three different ISIs . The Mean ( M ) and Standard Error ( SE ) , calculated across games , are indicated within each panel . As is evident from the figures , the performance of the subjects was similar regardless of age . That is , there was a systematic decrease in signal level across trials . Once the masked threshold was approached the subjects tracked the signal to the end of the game ; viz. , the eighth turn-around . Also , as can be seen from the figures , the within subject variability ( SE ) was quite small and differed little as a function of age . This latter result reflects the reliability of the subject 's performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mean masked threshold is plotted as a function of ISI . The standard error shown below each ISI indicate the presence of individual differences across subjects . The mean threshold , in all but four instances , decreases as a function of increasing ISI . In addition , the standard error for adults , at each ISI , is smaller than the standard error for children . The single exception is the 10-msec ISI for the 6-year-olds . <p> Figure 6 shows the mean-masked thresholds ( top panel ) and the best data ( lower panel ) for each group . In the former case each data point was determined by averaging across all subjects and all games . In the best data condition only a subject 's best game was used in the calculation . The best game was defined as the one that yielded the lowest masked threshold . The figure shows clearly that age affects task performance . The younger the child the higher the masked threshold . Two mixed design ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for age and ISI ( p < .001 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A significant Age X ISI interaction ( p < .02 ) occurred for the Mean Data but not the Best Data ( p > .35 ) . The Greenhouse-Geisser correction for df was applied where appropriate . Bonferroni post-hoc tests showed that , in both sets of data , the adult means were significantly lower ( p < .05 ) than those of the children at all ISI values . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS <p> The data support the conclusion that the rocketship video game reduces the within-subject variability often reported when young children are used in psychophysical experiments . One of the most striking features of the technique , aside from the video game itself , was the introduction of the touch screen for the subject 's response . The children specifically enjoyed interacting with the game by touching the rocketship which hid the gremlin . The immediate recording of the correct response and the attempted escape by the gremlin ( and its subsequent demise ) appeared to be important feedback for the child and the success of the technique . The interactive mode provided by the touch screen was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although button pressing had been used as a response mechanism for some of the older children at the outset of the project , the change to the touch screen activity , in conjunction with the inherently interesting gremlin rocketship video game , increased the children 's attention span , interest , and motivation to the level where even the younger children responded like adults ( e.g. , Figures 2 through 4 ) . That is , their data were reliable and systematic as they tracked the signal . In addition , they had relatively small standard errors both within a game as well as between games . The possible exception to this was the 5-year-olds . Not all 5-year-old children could learn to associate the gremlin chirp with the rocketship hiding the gremlin . Approximately 40-50% of the children at this age had difficulty and could not do the task after one practice game . Older children were all successful and played the game with no difficulty . <p> The data on the forward masking ( Figure 6 ) show clear and significant differences among the groups . The noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The younger the child the more effective the noise was in masking the signal . A plausible explanation is suggested by the rather remarkable similarity among the groups . The mean thresholds shifted downward systematically as age increased . This outcome suggests a single underlying factor associated with the differences in performance across groups . This factor , we believe , is the functional width of the auditory filter centered at the signal frequency . If the filter were larger in young children and decreased as a function of age , as suggested by other investigators ( e.g. , Irwin et al. , 1986 ) , then the present results are easily interpreted . The wider filters , at young ages , permit more noise to enter the auditory system and mask the signal . As the child grows older these functional filters decrease in width , are more selective , and simultaneously restrict the amount of noise entering the system . The reduction in noise at these older ages yields a lower masked threshold and parallel functions . <p> Finally , it is worth noting that even though the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 8 , there are significant differences between a child 's performance and that of an adult . First , it appears that , if the performance is indeed dependent upon the auditory filter width , the auditory filters have not reached their adult level by the age of 8 . Second , the between-subject variability was , in nearly all cases , larger for children . This outcome also suggests that children 's perceptual systems are still developing through 8 years of age . Moreover , the rate of development appears to vary widely ( Figure 5 ) . The data show , for example , that some of the younger children performed the perceptual task as well as children 2 years older . Large individual differences , however , are expected during the course of development . The critical factors for our purposes were the low within subject variance and the steady improvement in performance as a function of age . <p> 
##4001553 Maria Montessori ( 1870-1952 ) , the Italian physician turned educational theorist , espoused a form of education for young children that considered them in their entirety -- spirit , mind , and heart . Today , such education is called " holistic " and stands as a counterpoise to the kind of experience typically offered children in American schools ( J. Miller 1988 ; R. Miller 1990 ) . The holistic worldview is essentially a spiritual , rather than a materialistic , one . It prizes such tuner human qualities as mind , emotion , creativity , imagination , compassion , a sense of wonder , reverence , and the urge for self realization , recognizing these as vital aspects of human existence ( R. Miller 1990 , 58 ) . <p> Montessori 's view of the child is that of a human person creatively unfolding from within . " We know , " she says , " how to find pearls in the shells of oysters , gold in the mountains and coal in the bowels of the earth , but we are unaware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enters this world to renew mankind " ( 1970,240 ) . Montessori sees spiritual powers as a form of wealth that must go into circulation so that others can enjoy them , wealth that must be expressed and utilized ( 1970,140 ) . <p> As a young , enthusiastic educational reformer , Montessori agreed with Frederick Froebel 's view of education , to which she owed much : " By education , then , the divine essence of man should be unfolded , brought out , lifted into consciousness , and man himself reused into free , conscious obedience to the divine principle that lives in him , and to a free representation of this principle in his life " ( 1970,4 ) . Montessori 's agreement with Froebel stemmed from both her Roman Catholic belief in human transcendence and her clinical observations of young children . <p> Montessori 's life-long perception of her work as " scientific pedagogy " and her apparent need to have it considered as exclusively " scientific , " rather than as partially emanating from an intuitive or ideological source , strongly influenced the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the end of her life , especially in her books , The Absorbent Mind ( 1967 ) and The Child in The Family ( 1970 ) ( both posthumously published ) , she clearly indicated her method 's alt encompassing inspiration . <p> As an old , wise , and revered sage , interned in India during World War II , Montessori revisited her earliest educational views and restated them in language congenial to her audience . Together with Krishnamurti , Montessori believed that the right kind of education cultivates one 's whole being and with Gandhi , that " unless the development of the mind and body goes hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul , the former alone would prove to be a poor lopsided affair " ( 1970,138 ) . <p> For Montessori , education is a " help to life . " It transcends the narrow limits of direct instruction and direct transmission of knowledge from one mind to another . Montessori 's focus was on the " preparation of the environment , " the key to her idea of education from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert through children has the environment as its instrument , for the child absorbs his environment , takes everything from it , and incarnates it in himself " ( 1970,66 ) . Montessori deplored the universally limited perception of education as an education merely of the mind . " If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated Line of a mere transmission , there is little hope from it in the bettering of man 's future . If help and salvation are to come , they can only come from the children , for the children are the makers of men " ( 1970,4 ) . <p> Montessori sees education as a help to the unfolding of the child 's inborn psychic powers . She , through her method , proposes to unleash the constructive energy of the child , which she maintains has returned unnoticed for thousands of years . Using as an example the facility with which every child acquires his or her language of origin , Montessori finds within every child a painstaking teacher . " The only language men ever speak perfectly is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them anything " ( 1970,6 ) . Montessori sees the teacher 's task as " not to talk " but to prepare and arrange a series of motives for cultural activity within an environment especially designed for the young child . The child 's education is not acquired by listening to the teacher 's words but by virtue of experiences in which the child acts on his environment . Forty years of experience with young children in many countries persuaded Montessori that the child 's individual activity was the one factor that stimulated and produced development ( 1970,8 ) . " We teachers can only help the work going on , as servants wait upon a master . We then become witnesses to the development of the human soul " ( 1970,9 ) . <p> Montessori sees the traditional credit given parents , especially mothers , for the formation of the child as a major obstacle to understanding the child 's inner powers . " We used to say that it was the mother who formed the child ; for it is she who teaches him to walk , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by the mother . It is an achievement of the child . What the mother brings forth is the baby , but it is the baby who produces the man " ( 1970,16 ) . Montessori reserves a particularly harsh judgment for authoritarian parents bent on replicating themselves in their children . She saw the reactions of the young children in her schools , where youngsters ' repressed spirits expanded and revealed themselves , as an indication of the serious child-rearing errors committed in the past . She described the children in her schools as tranquil , absorbed , and intensely interested in their work , achieving an amazing level of serenity . " Evidently , our students ' natural spontaneity , which derives mysteriously from the child 's inner life , had long been suppressed by the energetic and inopportune intervention of adults , who believe they can do everything better than children , substituting their own activities for those of the children and forcing them to submit their will and initiative to adult control " ( 1970,10-11 ) . <p> Children who live in a world created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . Montessori sees virtually all child rearing and education pervaded by the notion of adaptation of the child to the adult world , adaptation based upon an unquestioning obedience , " which leads to the negation of the child 's personality " ( 1970,12 ) . Her solution to the problem is to create for young children an adaptive environment different from the ones in which children typically operate and that have already formed their characters . " The implementation of any educational system ought to begin with the creation of an environment that protects the child from the difficult and dangerous obstacles that threaten him in the adult world . The shelter in the storm , the oasis in the desert , the place of spiritual rest ought to be created in the world precisely to assure the healthy development of the child " ( 1970,13 ) . <p> Montessori argues for the child as a separate being , rather than as an extension of parents or as an appendage of family . " The child as a separate entity , with different needs to satisfy in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration " ( 1970,15 ) . Montessori exhorts parents , politicians , and educators to join forces in their respect and help for the " construction work the human soul is called upon to do , a work of formation which brings out the immense potentialities with which children , the sons of men , are endowed " ( 1970,17 ) . <p> Montessori 's explanation of the child 's immediate postnatal development is as a " spiritual embryo . " Just as the prenatal period has done its formative work in the physical sphere , so the formative work of the postnatal period is to make the baby into a kind of " spiritual embryo . " Unlike infra-human species , only man has this double embryonic life characterized by his prolonged infancy . " If the work of man on the earth is related to his spirit , to his creative intelligence , then his spirit and his intelligence must be the fulcrum of his existence , and of all the workings of his body . About this fulcrum his behavior is organized , and even his physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual halo " ( 1970,61 ) . <p> If it is , as she believes , the nature of man be ruled by an enfolding spiritual halo , then , Montessori maintains , the care given the newborn must be care transcending bodily needs . The ability of newborns to absorb everything around them directly dictates the design of a particular environment for them . " The child has a different relation to his environment from ours . Adults admire their environment ; they can remember it and think about it ; but the child absorbs it . The things he sees are not just remembered ; they form pan of his soul , He incarnates in himself all in the world about him that his eyes see and his ears hear . In us the same things produce no change , but the child is transformed by them " ( 1970,62 ) . <p> Montessori underscores the immense influence that education , in the guise of a " prepared " environment , can exert on newborns. gifted as they are , with a capacity for incarnation . This environment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children are born with a vital force already present in general structure of the absorbent mind . This structure changes throughout their early life in response to growth and psychic development , as well as to their interactions with the environment . <p> Montessori envisions as the steward of the child 's emergent spirit a parent or teacher with faith that children , if allowed , will epiphanize their true selves . " Our schools , " she says , " offer the tinies ( two and three year olds ) a sheltering refuge in which the first elements of character can take shape " ( 1970,222 ) . The teacher is the keeper and custodian of the environment and an exemplar of non-intrusive behavior . " Although the relationship between the child and teacher is in the spiritual field , the teacher can find a very good model for her behavior in the way a good valet looks after his master . ...

##4001557 In the beginning there was Spider Woman , she who was called Thought Woman . At the dawn of being , Spider Woman spun a line from North to South , and another from East to West . She sat by these threads that stretched to the four horizons , which she had drawn across the universe , and she sang . As she sang two daughters came forth : Ut Set , who became the mother of the Pueblo people , and Nau Ut Set , who became the mother of all others . On all her daughters ' children Spider Woman placed a covering of creative wisdom , spun from her own spider being . To each she attached a thread of her web . It is for this reason that each person has a delicate thread connected to Spider Woman , connected through a doorway in the top of the skull . We chant to keep the doorway open . <p> Many forget the door . They grow cruel and corrupt . Only those who remember to keep the door open , to draw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . They can see and feel the thread that is their part of the web of destiny that Spider Woman weaves . -- Keres Pueblo creation myth adapted from Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood by Merlin Stone <p> <p> Narratives concerning the origin , nature , and functioning of the world provide a container within which the individual develops a particular relationship to experience . That container helps to delineate the boundaries of consciousness for both the individual and the group . As Paula Gunn Allen says in her recent book Grandmothers of the Light ( 1991,229 ) , " Thought Woman spins her web of dreams , thinks us into being , dances us into existence . As she thinks , so we are . " This article examines the thesis that , as the gods or goddesses of creation think , so the individual is . Cosmology , that aspect of a culture 's mythology that defines the origin and nature of the universe , reflects psychology ; the culture 's image of the cosmos is mirrored in the structure of the individual psyche . My use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of the self , particularly the relationship between ego and the unconscious . <p> This is not to imply a direct cause and effect relationship between the structure of the psyche and cosmological narrative . That in itself would be an attempt to force a complex nonlinear reality into a linear form . Cultural and clinical observations imply that cosmology and psyche do not interact in a specifically predictable , diagrammable way . The relationship between psyche and cosmology seems to be that of an interactional field , a series of reflections connected in a web of facets , many of which can not be addressed in this discussion and some of which are unknown to us . This field filters perception and guides the assignment of value and meaning , shaping the experience of reality . Accessing a nonlinear reality is difficult with linear , cognitive tools . The rationally oriented ego must adjust to tracking visible aspects of this web in order to gain clues concerning its nature . This process is somewhat like following the trails of atomic particles in a cloud chamber . The object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduce certain of its characteristics from its visible effects . <p> One visible effect of the multilayered field is cosmological narrative . These narratives are constructs of reality that include metastories concerning the creation of the world and the way the world functions ; tales of the nature of a particular human group and its place and function in that world ; and individual life stories of origin , purpose , and relationship to the whole . The scope of normal awareness and the limits of perception can to a certain extent to be charted or envisioned by building a picture of individual or group cosmology . An exploration of the cosmological stories of Western science illustrates this relationship and reveals psychological implications concerning the experience of mystery and rationality . In contrast , the cosmology of the Spider Woman stories presents a different perception of reality . <p> Spider Woman , as a Goddess of creation , evokes a universe in which tangible and intangible realities overlap ; human beings exist in both layers . The cosmology of the Keres Pueblo provides a container within which the individual can maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destiny . Enactment of a ritual round of ceremony connects the community and its members to the mythic universe of mystery , the ground of being . A cycle of stories describes the mythic world as an integral part of the " real " world and conveys , through narrative , relationships among the cohabitants of a multilayered universe ( Gunn Allen 1991 ) . Attention and participation will bring the individual to awareness of his or her connection to the cosmos , a weblike interconnection that permanently exists , although it might be " forgotten . " Mystery is a natural , even nourishing aspect of existence , conveyed through story and image as both immanent and transcendent , ineffable but deeply felt , the source of meaning and inspiration . This creation story portrays a metaphysical ground of being much like the Hindu picture of Brahman , " the life force of the universe which secretly dwells in all things , " as the Upanishadsjung describes it . How do these images compare to those of Western cosmology ? <p> Some mythic traditions of the Western world offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateways to mystery , but the common practice of secular life in Western culture excludes a personal connection to the ground of being . The dominant worldview attempts to define the universe , its inhabitants , and their relationships through a scientistic methodology that explicitly excludes the existence of mystery . This cosmological structure constitutes a secular myth which states that the cosmos is entirely subject to rational explanation , if only one has sufficient data . <p> Thus the prevailing cosmology of America has gone beyond the worldview of the patriarchal monotheisms . The Genesis God of creation forms a world in which the individual is born out of connection to the ground of being but , through the careful following of rules , may gain a hierarchical relationship to the source of creation ( Campbell 1968 ) . Received secular wisdom depicts instead a cosmos to which one can relate only through the medium of rational understanding . The God of creation in this cosmology is rational cause and effect , and the ground of being has all but disappeared from conscious perception . <p> Within this worldview the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have explained and that which we are in the process of researching . As a pragmatically enlightened people , we travel down the linear road of time , acquiring knowledge of and therefore mastery of a fundamentally mechanistic cosmos in which human cognition is the essence of awareness . Insights that question the primacy of linear understanding , such as chaos theory or the delineation of the unconscious , are regularly reworked so that they appear to support the quest for a fully rational explanation of the universe . All those aspects of the universe and the human being that are not particularly amenable to rational analysis assume nonreality . And thus the cosmos is split . One can not experience any valid relationship to the mysterious ground of being , because mystery itself is merely a misperception springing from inadequate research . We " limit the definition of reality to the body of theoretical and empirical knowledge at our disposal and declare as meaningless all questions about the actual nature of systems " ( Keller 1985 , 147 ) . Experiences and inquiries that resist the process of linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual . <p> How are nonrational experiences relegated to shadow ? Most commonly , society or culture , particularly patriarchal culture , is spoken of as a sort of force that somehow controls the individual 's perceptions and creates shadow . The image is of culture as an external power whose influence can perhaps be eliminated by the individual through insight and the adoption of new rules for thinking and living ( as with political correctness ) . Such efforts are frequently ineffective . People raised within the Western worldview mirror the cosmological split of the culture in the structure of their psyches . They must work with the " real but unknown " ( Jung 1966 ) aspects of self in order to effect a change in how reality is experienced . Intellectual decisions are inadequate for this level of change . <p> How is the split cosmos of Western culture reflected in the individual psyche ? Conscious and unconscious aspects of the psyche are strictly separated . The standard ego in this configuration is the ultimate rationalistic arbiter of reality itself , the personality 's scientist attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Internal and external experiences that can not be molded to the ego 's grasp can only reside in the unconscious . Ego strength is directly opposed to that archetypal , nonlinear world of mystery that is without boundaries . Thus , it lives in the unconscious . Flexibility in the separation of ego and unconscious is synonymous with inaccurate perception , if not delusion . <p> In the typical individual only severe trauma or neurological imbalance will prevent the structure of the psyche from being formed by the time adulthood is reached . From that point , perception is determined by the boundaries of the ego and the relationship between ego and unconscious . Jung ( 1966 ) thought that the ego forms a lens or filter that bends external and internal stimuli into shapes it can handle . The ego complex of the healthy Western , post-Enlightenment individual is cognitively imperialistic in its effort to master all phenomena . This style of ego is the perfect partner to a cosmology that imagines a universe in which the conquest of phenomena through rational understanding is the ultimate good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . Where can ineffable mystery reside in the domain of such an ego ? It exists in the unconscious aspect of the psyche , where its spiritual reality is enmeshed with all other unexplainable phenomena , including pathogenic material . <p> It was Jung 's opinion that the ego-dominated , rationalistic stance of the Western psyche gives rise to loss of meaning in the experience of life ( Jung 1966 ) . In this way , the disappearance of meaning from inner life reflects the disappearance of the ground of being from cosmology . His attempt to mediate this psychic structure was to emphasize the deep archetypal meaning in mythic images that emerge from the unconscious . The individual 's journey into the archetypal level of the unconscious aspect of the psyche provides a connection to the ground of being and thus a felt sense of meaning . Analytic psychologists tend to use this framework to interpret the myths of tribal cultures as though the images in those stories are manifestations of the unconscious life of the tribe ( e.g. , Sandner 's Navajo Symbols of Healing , 1979 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego complex , this is an accurate interpretation . If they do not have that structure , it is a misrepresentation . <p> Several years ago I was visiting a friend who was pediatrician for the Indian Health Service on a Navajo reservation . We were driving through an arroyo in her truck one day , when she told me about beliefs concerning the coyote that she had encountered among her patients and their parents . She then asked me what I made of these beliefs . Clearly she was asking me for a psychological interpretation . I looked out the window to consider my answer , and there was a coyote running along the top of the arroyo , keeping pace with the truck . Before I could say anything , the coyote dashed across the path of the truck . Smoke immediately began to pour from the dashboard , and the truck shuddered to a halt . I offered no psychological interpretations to my friend concerning the unconscious meaning of coyote stories . <p> When Gunn Allen writes of the " living reality of the Medicine world " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly challenges the usual and traditional psychological interpretations of mythological symbols . Her statement that myths are " factual accounts " that " connect with deep levels of being , not because the figures they tell about are . . . denizens of . . . the unconscious but because the supernaturals live within the same environs that humans occupy " asks us to shake loose from the Western ego complex and enter into the cosmological container of Spider Woman . <p> Her statements , which are echoed by Leslie Marmon Silko and others , seem to indicate an ego complex that is not imperial in its rational conquest of the phenomenal world but which is willing to be acted on and to interact with aspects of the cosmos that can not be explained or mastered . I speculate that the psyche formed within such a cosmological container might have an entirely different relationship to nonlinear aspects of the universe . The relationship between ego and unconscious might not be an adversarial split but rather a floating and permeable one . Cosmos and psyche in such a container might reflect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjectobject split . <p> A year after the incident in the arroyo , I again visited my friend . She continued to recount the stories told to her by her patients , but she told them with a fascination and absorption that clearly did not ask for interpretations . When I mentioned the shift in her attitude , she told me her own story . One night a very small baby who was expected to die had inexplicably rallied and lived . This was not an unknown experience for her as a doctor , and , within the culture of medicine there are accepted ways of looking at such events . For some reason , that night she realized that the accepted stance was a sort of nonexplanation , a way of putting aside a mysterious event . She began to consider her experience with the baby as a real question . Six months later that particular question was still unanswered , but , in trying to answer it , my friend had entered into a chain of questions concerning her beliefs about the nature of reality , causality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cosmological beliefs were completely changed but several gateways had opened in its framework and a relationship with the mysterious had begun with that first question based in genuine curiosity . Such questions honestly addressed are the key to change . <p> There is a story in which the twins Monster Slayer and Born for Water meet Spider Woman on the path of the gods . She says , " Before I help you must tell me as fully as you can who you are and where you come from . You must tell me what you have done and what you hope to do " ( Zolbrod 1989 , 196 ) . The twins do not find it easy to answer her , but , when they do , they enter a new level of experience . If an individual or group is willing to articulate a detailed picture of the universe and their place in it , and especially to bring the underlying unconscious assumptions of that picture to light , room is created for previously unknown influences . As Keller describes her analysis of the construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that we make for nature and nature 's observable phenomena . There is space as well between the ideology of inquiry and its practice ( Keller 1985 ) . Into these spaces , the process of change enters . <p> This process can take place concerning a specific aspect of worldview , or it can encompass the nature of reality . It is a process that can be triggered by a crisis , a piece of luck , an accident , an epiphany , an insight . It is not a question of choosing a story or script that is therapeutically or politically correct . Becoming conscious of and articulating the cosmological narrative that one is already living and finding its opportunities for expansion is the essence of the process . Such a narrative , when honestly mapped , contains many levels of the self . The ego is included but not exclusive . In addressing the myth and the story , we can go beyond a cognitive consideration or analysis of beliefs and beyond a catharsis of emotional reality . Exploration through narrative and image affects the internal relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psyche processes experience , the interaction of the ego and the unconscious . <p> As the mythic narrative unfolds , a container is needed for the multiple and sometimes contradictory layers -- symbolic , somatic , emotional , cognitive , and communal -- which emerge . Myth is " explanatory of how we began and also a prescriptive account of how subsequent beginnings ( which renew the cosmos ) should proceed ; the Last Supper , for example , tells us not only how the Christian era began but how its energies can be periodically renewed " ( Young 1991 , 28 ) . A ritual act recaptures the nature of the world with its multiple layers and connects individual consciousness back to those layers least evident in the work-a-day world . The split cosmos and the split psyche are woven back into the web . Ritual practice provides a container which also feeds back into the exploration of narrative . Many activities beyond those which are typically referred to as ritual serve the same function -- art , ceremony , psychotherapy ( the ritualistic aspects of which are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . What ever the form of the ritual , it must be rooted in the cosmological narrative in order to renew the cosmos in an evolving form ; in turn , the ritual must inform the myth .

##4001353 To put Singer 's ( 1992 ) work on relative deprivation and responses to preferential treatment in context , studies from a procedural justice perspective are reviewed . That review suggests that the psychological dynamics of preferential treatment are well accounted for by concepts derived from theories of procedural justice . It is thus argued that , to be parsimonious , Singer 's work is best conceptualized in procedural justice rather than relative deprivation terms . <p> What theoretical approaches have provided us with some understanding of the social psychological dynamics of preferential treatment ? According to Singer ( 1992 ) , " . . . neither distributive nor procedural justice ! theories have been applied to fairness issues involving personnel selection or preferential hiring ( p. 130 ) . But Singer has apparently ignored that theories of procedural justice have been used to conceptualize the psychological dynamics of preferential treatment . Indeed , the evidence from studies guided by procedural justice theory is so strong that such studies constitute a standard by which new theoretical approaches to the issue should be gauged . PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preferential treatment from a procedural justice perspective have been varied and , in the main , were undertaken in response to studies rooted in a pure distributive justice perspective . Working from equity theory , Austin , Friedman , Martz , Hooe &; Ball ( 1977 ) had claimed to show that , when individuals were led to believe that they had been selected for a position because of their gender , they evaluated their own selection as unfair . The notion was that , if an individual was selected because of his or her gender , that would mean that the individual 's outcomes ( i.e. , getting the position ) would not be commensurate with her or his inputs ( i.e. , their technical qualifications ) . In view of their findings , Austin et al . concluded that " the procedure of affirmative sexual discrimination renders situations unfair even when normal standards of distributive justice are satisfied : ( p. 292 ) . <p> Nacoste ( 1985 ) took exception to the conclusions drawn by Austin et al . He argued that , since those researchers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , it was premature to claim that they had shown that the " procedure of affirmative sexual discrimination " is viewed as unfair by recipients of the gender-based favorable treatment . Working from the then relatively new procedural justice literature , Nacoste argued that one could differentiate between classes of preferential selection procedures . Specifically , he argued that a procedure of preferential treatment could be designed to give an absolute advantage to members of a certain group ( e.g. , women ) , while another procedure could be designed to give some weight to membership in that group while still giving significant weight to technical qualifications . The former procedure would ignore " equity inputs " ( e.g. , completion of high school ) , whereas the latter procedure would give those " equity inputs " significant weight without ignoring group membership . As Nacoste put it , " the distinction between the two is at least analogous to the distinction ( made in the procedural justice literature ) between an equity and a legalistic procedure " ( p. 228 ) . Given this procedural justice connection , Nacoste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would be perceived as fairer by beneficiaries of preferential treatment and cause those beneficiaries to have more positive emotional responses to being selected . Using a manipulation of procedure that was true to that conceptualization , Nacoste provided strong empirical support for his hypothesis . Even with individual qualifications varied , selection procedure had independent effects on the perceived fairness of the process and outcome as well as beneficiaries ' affective responses . <p> Following that work , a number of other studies were conducted . Nacoste &; Lehman ( 1987 ) showed that the level of evaluation apprehension that might be experienced by beneficiaries of preferential treatment varied with type of selection procedure . A selection procedure that did not give weight to equity inputs ( i.e. , a nonequity procedure ) as compared to one that did ( i.e. , an equity procedure ) increased the level of evaluation apprehension experienced by beneficiaries . When a nonequity procedure was used , beneficiaries expected that relevant others would not evaluate their work objectively and positively . <p> Working from both the research on procedural justice and interdependence theory ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) addressed a question raised first by Touhey ( 1974 ) and secondly by Heilman &; Herlihy ( 1984 ) . The question : What are the conditions under which preferential treatment might negatively affect beneficiaries ' interest in an occupation or an organizational position ? Taking an approach different from any other proposed , Nacoste argued that individuals use procedures as a basis or cue for inferring an organization 's " disposition toward fairness . " He argued further that those inferences are important because they would influence the extent to which an individual would be attracted to formal association with the organization . Using the same manipulation as employed by Nacoste ( 1985 ) , this study found that , ( 1 ) based on the selection procedure used , beneficiaries do indeed make inferences about an organization 's disposition toward fairness , and that ( 2 ) the most important predictors of beneficiaries ' attraction to an organization are those procedure-based inferences ( Nacoste , 1987a ) . <p> These studies ( Nacoste , 1985 ; 1987a ; Nacoste &; Lehman , 1987 ) focus on the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they include concrete manipulations of procedures . But that is not much of a limitation , since it has been shown that beneficiaries ' prior evaluations of the fairness of the procedures of preferential treatment affect beneficiaries ' self-evaluations of ability when their selection by preferential treatment is made salient ( Nacoste , 1989 ) . Finally , as an aside , it is worth noting that some of this work has been replicated directly and extended to racial target groups ( e.g. , Arthur , Doverspike , &; Fuentes , 1992 ) and that , because of this work , the relevance of procedures in preferential treatment is being acknowledged generally ( Ayres , 1992 ; Tougas &; Beaton , 1992 ) . <p> We should be aware , of course , that the foregoing studies of the relationship between procedural justice and reactions to preferential treatment focused on the responses of potential beneficiaries . That fact notwithstanding , there is at least one published study that focused on the role of procedural justice in the responses of nonbeneficiaries . In the context of voting behavior , Nacoste ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also affected by the type of procedure used in making personnel selections . He argued that reactions to Walter Mondale 's selection of Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in a U.S. presidential election would be affected by an individual 's prior beliefs about , and evaluations of , affirmative action procedures . Procedures dictated by policies of preferential treatment would be relevant , Nacoste thought , because so much attention had been focused on " why " Ferraro was selected : was it her qualifications or her gender ? Following and extending the conceptualization of procedures developed by Nacoste ( 1985 ) , this study ( Nacoste , 1987b ) measured ( 1 ) college students , beliefs about how much weight was generally put on technical qualifications vs. group membership ( e.g. , gender , race ) in an afffirmative action procedure ( average procedure ) and ( 2 ) college students ' tolerance for the use of group membership as a selection criterion in an affirmative action procedure ( unacceptable procedure ) . Controlling for a variety of factors important to voting behavior ( for example , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote , discrepancies between the Average-procedure and the Unacceptable-procedure were strong predictors of tendencies to vote for the Mondale/Ferraro ticket . A respondent became less inclined to so vote in response to Mondale 's selection of Ferraro when the respondent thought that the Average-procedure gave the same or more weight to group membership , which the respondent evaluated as unacceptable . As importantly , those voting inclinations were a strong predictor of the final pattern of voting by study participants in the 1984 presidential election . PARSIMONY IN PSYCHOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS <p> Clearly , the evidence is that the reactions of both beneficiaries of preferential treatment and others are affected by procedural justice considerations . Thus , there is no basis for Singer 's ( 1992 ) assertion that no work has been done on the relationship between procedural justice and psychological responses to preferential treatment . In fact , the ability to use procedural justice as an approach to the responses of both beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries suggests that a procedural justice approach has the potential to be comprehensive . <p> But what makes procedures so powerful in this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach for work that follows in this domain ? In an important theoretical advance , Barnes Nacoste ( 1990 ) has argued that , like other procedures , procedures of preferential treatment or affirmative action are responded to " as a function of the degree to which evaluation criteria are structured within a selection procedure to give ' voice ' to each individual 's claims to deservingness of an outcome " ( p. 182 ) . The theory behind this claim is that : <p> Affirmative action selection procedures will be made up of two general sets of criteria : traditional qualifications and group membership , or universalistic and particularistic criteria , respectively . Universalistic criteria are criteria that are thought to be achieved and performance-related ( e.g. , experience ) . . . In procedural justice terms , these are " voice-related " criteria because consideration of these criteria gives voice to each person 's claims to achieved and lto performance-related deservingness of the outcome ( e.g. , a promotion ) . Particularistic criteria are not thought to be performance-related ( e.g. , ethnicity ) . . . Particularistic criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not relevant to achieved , performance-related deservingness . <p> According to Barnes Nacoste , any combined use of these criteria will constitute a procedure of preferential treatment . Moreover , <p> To the extent that universalistic criteria are given the most weight , beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries will perceive the policy to be fair because such a weighting structure gives " voice " to each person 's performance-related claims to deservingness . However , where particularistic criteria are given the most weight , the policy will be perceived to be unfair because a selection procedure so structured " silences " the performance-related " voice " associated with each individual 's credentials ( pp. 182-183 ) . <p> This theoretical approach is obviously supported by the research reviewed . As already indicated , in the Nacoste program of research , universalistic- ( or equity-based ) procedures were perceived as fairer than particularistic- ( or nonequity-based ) procedures . But what support is there for this " voice " interpretation ? From very early on in the procedural justice literature ( Thibaut &; Walker , 1978 ) , it has been shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to present individualized claims to an outcome ( for a recent overview see , Lind &; Tyler , 1988 ) . That is seen most clearly in the higher preference that individuals generally express for procedures that give them process control -- i.e. , control over the arrangement and presentation of their claims . When individuals have such process control or " voice , " not only do they perceive the procedure as fairer and are more satisfied with the procedure , but they also evaluate those acting in their behalf and the decision maker as more competent ( Thibaut &; Walker , 1975 ; pp. 67-80 ) . Aside from the effects on perceived fairness of process and outcome that we have seen for different procedures of preferential treatment , further evidence supportive of the voice interpretation comes from procedural effects on perceived competence of decision makers . In Nacoste 's 1985 study , subjects who thought that the selection committee had used a universalistic-procedure were more likely to believe that the committee was competent in carrying out its duties . Apparently , similar to that for other procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gives significant weight to voice-related decision criteria is taken as an indication of competent decision making . <p> Given the existence of what appears to be a comprehensive theoretical approach in the form of procedural justice , the value of new contributions to this literature must be evaluated in light of that approach . We should ask , is the new contribution distinct from the dominant framework ? If it is not distinct , is the new contribution consistent with the dominant framework ? <p> Although couched in terms provided by theories of relative deprivation , Singer 's ( 1992 ) work is not operationally distinct from the work done on the influence of procedural judgments on reactions to preferential treatment . Singer has essentially manipulated procedure at the level of the weight given to decision criteria . Rather than manipulate the overall structure of the procedure , indicating what decision criteria are supposed to be used and in what weighting arrangement , Singer manipulates and tests the effects of the actual decision criteria used . In a selection for training context , that is accomplished by providing information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender group membership . The trainability score is obviously the universalistic decision criterion and group membership the particularistic decision criterion . Singer 's results also follow what would be expected from the procedural justice approach to reactions to preferential treatment ; to the extent that the particularistic criterion appears to be given more weight than the universalistic criterion , the final decision is evaluated as less fair by those disadvantaged and advantaged by this positive weighting of group membership . <p> On the one hand , then , there is no reason to consider Singer 's work as other than another demonstration of the role of procedural justice in responses to preferential treatment . To accept the relative deprivation interpretation Singer offers is simply not parsimonious . Specifically , the latter would require us to violate in our inductive logic , the " requirement of total evidence . " Putting it directly , before accepting any new conceptual interpretation , " the total evidence available must be taken as basis for determining the degree of confirmation " ( Carnap , 1952 , pg . 211 ) . In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirical relations already developed from a procedural justice conceptualization . <p> On the other hand , Singer has made a contribution by providing a very important confirmation of one implication of the procedural justice approach to the psychology of preferential treatment . In two conceptual statements by Barnes Nacoste ( 1990,1992 ) , it is strongly implied that there should be a linear relationship between the weight given to universalistic relative to particularistic decision criteria . Whereas some empirical suppoti for this theoretical expectation has emerged ( e.g. , Nacoste , 1985 ) , that support has been indirect . So Singer has taken the critical step of demonstrating in full the expected linear relationship between procedural stntcture and psychological responses to preferential treatment . <p> 
##4001355 On the basis of both previous and recent research on intercultural perceptions ( Lee &; Ottati , 1993 ; Triandis &; Vassiliou , 1967 ) , it is hypothesized that perceived group homogeneity would be intimately related to familial loyalty ( or commitment ) and stability . A cross-cultural questionnaire study was conducted both in the People 's Republic of China ( n=182 ) and in the United States of America ( n=182 ) . The results revealed that both Chinese and American subjects perceived a collectivistic society to have more familial commitment and stability while they perceived an individualistic society to have less familial commitment and stability . The implications for this study have been discussed . <p> As the divorce rate in the United States rose surprisingly from the 1950s to 1980s , the issue of marriage and the family seems increasingly important to research . Ostensibly , marriage and the family have an effect on the quality of life . Because of this , much work has been done on love and intimacy ( e.g. , Clark &; Reiss , 1988 ; Fromm , 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see O'Leary &; Smith , 1991 ) . However , little attention has been paid to cross-cultural research on why one culture ( such as the United States ) has a higher divorce rate than another , and on whether culturally different people would have a different degree of their family commitment and stability . <p> Many social scientists have argued that socio-cultural context has much impact on familial loyalty and marriage stability ( see Bellah , Madsen , Sullivan , Swidler &; Tipton , 1985 ; Dion &; Dion , 1988 ; Triandis , 1990 ; Yang , 1986 ; Yee , 1989 ) . Some research has even suggested an influence of culture and religion on familial responsibility and stability ( e.g. , Brodbar-Nemzer , 1986 ; Cherlin &; Celebuski , 1983 ; D'Antonio et al. , 1982 ; Hsu , 1983 ) . For instance , Brodbar-Nemzer ( 1986 ) has found a relationship between divorce and group commitment . That is , American Jews who had a greater group commitment on a variety of Jewish variables ( e.g. , denomination , ritual observance , synagogue attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were consistently less likely to have been divorced . <p> Although the study by Brodbar-Nemzer indicated that Jewish culture and religion had an influence on American Jewish familial loyalty and marriage stability , would non-Jewish Americans agree that , because of Jewish culture and religion , Jews are more committed and loyal to their families than non-Jewish people ? Unfortunately , his research did not address this question . The current study attempts to test whether there would be a perceptual agreement between culturally different subjects as far as familial loyalty and marriages stability are concerned . <p> In social sciences , it has often been argued that Chinese culture is collectivistic while American culture is individualistic ( e.g. , Fairbank , 1987 ; Hsu , 1983 ) . Consistent with this position , Triandis and his colleagues ( Triandis , 1990 ; Triandis , McCusker &; Hui , 1990 ) have found that in individualistic cultures , people put much emphasis on values and interests that serve the self by making the self feel good , be distinguished , and be independent . These people more likely tend to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , in collectivistic cultures , people stress values and interests that serve the ingroup by subordinating personal goals for the sake of preserving ingroup integrity , interdependence of members , and harmonious relationships , and the self is usually defined in ingroup terms ( also see Triandis et al. , 1988 ) . <p> Furthermore , Triandis , McCusker and Hui ( 1990 ) pointed out that one of the distinctions between collectivistic and individualistic cultures was that people in a collectivistic society tended perceived ingroup members to be homogeneous while people in an individualistic society tended to perceive the ingroup to be heterogeneous . In their cross-cultural research , Lee and Ottati ( 1993 ) have also found that both Chinese and Americans perceived Chinese people to be homogeneous and perceived Americans to be heterogeneous . Triandis ( 1990 ) also reported similar results among Chinese mainland residents and American Illinois residents . <p> If people emphasize " homogeneity " or collectivity socially , it may suggest that the loyalty to or harmoniousness with an ingroup ( e.g. , family , work group or community ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals or interest over society or group ( e.g. , family , work group or community ) , it means that the self/individuality and personal pleasure are important . <p> Research by Buss and 50 other cross-cultural psychologists all over the world ( Buss et al. , 1990 ) also showed that people from collectivistic cultures such as China , India and Iran valued " chastity " and " good house keeping " in selecting matches , whereas people from individualistic cultures such as France , America and Spain stressed " personal pleasure " and " exciting personality . " When love and marriage are primarily seen as psychological satisfaction in individualistic cultures , they may fail to fulfill their social function of providing people with stable , committed relationships that tie them into the larger and more homogeneous society/entity . For example , it was reported that Americans got much " happier " with their marriage relationship in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 1950s , but the rate of divorce has increased ( Bellah et al. , 1985 , p. 85 ) . <p> Moreover , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services , the divorce rate per 1,000 population remained 4.7 in 1990 , and between 1970 and 1990 the proportion tripled from 47 divorced persons per 1,000 married persons ( with spouse present ) to 142 per 1,000 ( Wright , 1992 ) . Dion and Dion ( 1988 ) explained that Americans ' high rate of divorce was possibly due to the culture 's exaggerated sense of individualism in society or due to much emphasis on one 's individuality and independence from their group ( e.g. , family ) . <p> Seligman ( 1991 ) also pointed that much individualism and the waxing of the self in the United States coincided with a diminished sense of community and loss of higher purposes ( e.g. , less family stability ) . Similarly , Bellah et al . ( 1985 ) stated , " The meaning of one 's life for most Americans is to become one 's own person , almost give birth to oneself , " and much of this process involves breaking free from their families , communities and inherited ideas ( p. 82 ) . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families as shameful and/or at least as negative ( Hsu , 1953 , 1963 ) . They derive the meaning of the self from their relationship to others and perceive themselves to be similar to or at least part of a group/family ( Tu , 1985 ; also see Yee , 1989 ) . Therefore , on the basis of the foregoing discussion , it is reasonable to assume that perceived group homogeneity would be positively correlated with familial loyalty and stability . METHOD Subjects <p> The sample consisted of 182 subjects in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and 182 subjects in the United States of America ( USA ) . Within the Chinese sample , there were 162 students and 20 teachers . This included 20 subjects from the Changsha Railway Institute ( Southern China ) , 75 from Hunan Normal University ( Southern China ) , 49 from Beijing Normal University ( Northern China ) , 17 from the Beijing Management College ( Northern China ) , and 21 Mainland Chinese students from elsewhere . The sample encompassed a variety of academic majors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Management , Mathematics , Chemistry , Physics , and Engineering . The average age of the Chinese sample was 27.2 . There were 104 male subjects and 78 female subjects . A total of 26 subjects got married while the rest of them were single . The Mainland Chinese subjects received the questionnaire from their academic instructors . <p> The American data were collected from 182 American college students . These subjects were approached in class and received the questionnaire from a research assistant . As with the Chinese sample , the American sample encompassed a variety of academic majors . These included Psychology , Sociology , Biology , Chemistry , and Engineering . There were only 6 subjects who got married . Eighty four of the American subjects were male and 98 were female . The average age of the American sample was 21.2 . Measures <p> The questionnaire items included measures of perceived group homogeneity and perceived family commitment and stability . The measure of perceived group homogeneity was also used in the study of Lee and Ottati ( 1993 ) . In measuring both perceived group homogeneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the items along a five-point ordinal scale ranging from " strongly agree " ( 1 ) to " strongly disagree " ( 5 ) . <p> Perceived Group Homogeneity . After subjecting the homogeneity items to tests for accuracy and reliability ( see accuracy and reliability results below ) , the pool of items was reduced to 12 measures as the independent variable . Specifically , these perceived homogeneity items were extracted from a cross-cultural questionnaire through a factor analysis ( see Lee &; Ottati , 1993 ) . In order to assess perceived group homogeneity , the following items were administered : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Thus each subject responded to a total of twelve **25;684;TOOLONG items . Translated versions of these twelve items were administered to the Chinese sample . <p> Perceived Familial Loyalty/Commitment . The dependent variable in this study was family commitment . A factor analysis of these family commitment items revealed that the following items loaded strongly on the first factor for both the Chinese and American sample . These items were used to assess the perception of Sino-American family commitment and stability . PREFORMATTED TABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American target culture were administered to both Chinese and American groups . Thus each subject responded to a total of six family commitment and stability items . The Chinese sample was given translated versions of these six items . RESULTS <p> All items were scored such that higher numbers reflect greater perceived group homogeneity , and greater familial loyalty/commitment and stability . Sums of the appropriate items were also computed in order to arrive at indices of total group homogeneity and total familial loyalty and stability . Accuracy and Reliability of Measures <p> Accuracy of Translation . The English version of the questionnaire was translated into a Chinese version by the author of this article . The author is a native of Mainland China who has known English for over 12 years and has resided in the United States for the past six years . In order to check the accuracy and consistency of the English and Chinese versions , both versions were administered to 22 Chinese bilinguals who had studied English for an average of 10.4 years . The bilingual judges rated the translation for each item as very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or very inaccurate . On the basis of their ratings , 72% of the judges rated these items as " very accurate " or " accurate " ; 20% rated these items as " hard to be evaluated " ; and only 8% rated these items as " inaccurate " overall . Because the author understands Sino-American emics ( i.e. , culture-specific aspects ) and etics ( i.e. , culture-common aspects ) , the results of this evaluation method should be as valid as the outcome of back translation or multiple translation procedures ( Brislin , 1986 , 1993 ) . <p> Homogeneity Scale . In order to assess the internal consistency of the homogeneity scale , an alpha coefficient ( Cronbach , 1951 ) was computed for the American and Chinese samples separately . The alpha for the American sample was .73 and the alpha for the Chinese sample was .71 . In sum , the homogeneity scale satisfied fairly stringent criteria with regard to both accuracy and internal consistency . <p> Familial Loyalty/Stability Scale . The item set , which taps a familial loyalty and stability measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese ( alpha=.69 ) and American sample ( alpha=.58 ) . Basic Sino-American Findings <p> The results from the Chinese sample indicated a significant correlation between perceived Chinese homogeneity and Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.20 , p < .01 ) and a significant correlation between perceived American homogeneity and American familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.30 , p < .001 ) . In the American sample , there was only a significant correlation between perceived Chinese homogeneity and Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( r = +.17 , p < .05 ) , and the relationship between American homogeneity and American familial loyalty and stability was very weakly correlated ( r = +.07 , ns ) but not significant . <p> Moreover , Chinese subjects scored higher in Chinese familial loyalty and stability ( M = 9.31 ) than in American familial loyalty and stability ( M = 2.97 ) , t ( 181 ) = 28.67 , p < .0001 . In a similar vein , American subjects reported that Chinese had more familial loyalty and stability ( M = 8.74 ) than Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 11.89 , p < .001 ( see Table 1 ) . This supported the hypothesis . <p> As noted previously , the Chinese culture , which was collectivistic , was different from the American culture , which was individualistic . This cultural difference was reflected in the results both in the Chinese and in the American sample -- i.e. , strong evidence of the close relationship between perceived homogeneity and familial loyalty and stability . DISCUSSION <p> Based on the previous data , this study revealed that perceived group homogeneity was correlated with the judgments of familial loyalty/commitment and stability , and that both Chinese and American subjects reported that , the more homogeneous a culture was perceived to be , the greater perceived familial loyalty and stability it might have . In other words , the results both from the Chinese and from the American sample showed that Chinese families were seen as more stable and Chinese people were seen as more loyal to their families than American counterparts . <p> The current results may be due to different cultural ideologies . For example , according to Bellah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans believe the individual has a primary reality where a group or society is a second order , a derived or artificial construct ( p. 334 ) . On the other hand , there is a totally different ideology of family commitment and marriage stability in Chinese culture . To many Chinese , a group ( e.g. , family , clan , or community ) is always a part of his selfhood and is a place where he or she always stays ( Tu , 1985 ) . For example , a Chinese may think family commitment and marriage stability are more important than his or her personal interest or pleasure . This ideology is possibly based on Chinese Confucianism ( Lee , 1991 ; Tu , 1985 ) . Fairbank , an American sinologist wrote : <p> The Chinese are collective , seemingly eager to be just like one another , to work together and not separately , to conform and not deviate , and to get their satisfaction from the approval of the group and constituted authority rather than from realizing private ambitions or any form of self-indulgence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within group , not apart from it , is of course not a transient vogue but the product of many centuries of Confucian family collectivism , now redirected to serve the people ' ( Fairbanks , 1987 , p. 96 ) . <p> Moreover , Chinese people usually reprimand or at least hold a very negative attitude toward those who deviate from an ingroup ( e.g. , a family or community ) while Americans do not . Take divorce for example . American men and women " can marry as often as they are widowed or divorced , and there is no significant stigma against either " ( Hsu , 1963 , p. 193 ) . In China , the pressure from a family , from a community , and from peers ( e.g. , friends or colleagues ) is very severely put on those who will get or have gotten divorced . The divorced people are usually stigmatized . <p> Although the data here revealed that perceived group homogeneity were related to familial loyalty/commitment and stability in this cross-cultural survey , other explanations deserve discussion . One of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than Chinese subjects . But by analysis of variance , age was not a significant mediator of our dependent measures . <p> Another interpretation is a " kernel of truth " ( Allport , 1954 ; Triandis &; Vassiliou , 1967 ) . That is , perceptions or stereotypes of a social group are based on the objective characteristics of the target group . Some social stereotypes or social perceptions may have a component of veridicality ( Funder , 1987 ; Jussim , 1991 ) . In other words , it is possibly true that Chinese may have a lower rate of divorce than Americans regardless of whether Chinese are perceived as homogeneous or not . <p> Nevertheless , we need to realize that , due to an open-door policy in recent years , the People 's Republic of China has become more and more exposed to Western cultures and ideology . As a result , the concept of the self in China today also is changing ( Chu , 1985 ) . Chinese families now are less stable than before . It was reported that the rate of divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ await further research . <p> In conclusion , the results of this study suggested that perceived group homogeneity is related to the judgments of familial loyalty and stability . That is , Chinese and American college subjects perceived Chinese to have more familial loyalty and stability whereas they perceived Americans to have less familial commitment and stability . These data may be due to different cultural ideologies . Also , as Mainland China changes , its family structure and stability will change . <p> 
##4001477 Letter series and number series tests , consisting of items based on identical rules , were administered in a counterbalanced design to 320 ( 160 female and 160 male ) undergraduates in order to investigate the gender differences in inductive reasoning ability measured by letter and number series tests . Results indicated that female college students obtained significantly higher ( p < .05 ) means on letter series tests , but showed no such superiority on number series . <p> Gender differences in biosocial and behavioral attributes constitute a lively area of scientific debate and research . Some reviews of research ( Maccoby &; Jacklin , 1974 ; Maccoby , 1990 ) seemed to indicate some replicable gender differences in performance on tests of mathematical and spatial abilities , but other aspects of intellect seemed to be equal in the two genders . Other reviewers ( Hyde , Fennema &; Lamon , 1990 ) concluded that gender differences in mathematics performance were small and favored females in samples of the general population . Girls showed a slight superiority in computation at or below the middle school level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college on complex problem-solving tasks . Also , the magnitude of the differences in mathematics performance in favor of men has declined over the years ; studies published since 1974 have shown difference only about half as large as that indicated by studies published in 1973 or earlier . <p> A number of problem-solving tasks ( e.g. , probability concepts or probability learning tasks , matrix items , and letter series or number series items ) involve cognitive processes that are common to the traditional psychometric instruments , sequential information processing tasks , and mathematical problem solving . Letter or number series items are considered a measure of inductive reasoning ability ( Thurstone , 1938 ) and a convenient vehicle for illustrating a theory for the acquisition of rules for sequential patterns ( Simon &; Kotovsky , 1963 ) . Letter or number series items involve mathematical operations whose frequency and complexity can be manipulated to construct very difficult sequential patterns or problem-solving tasks ( Butterfield , Nielsen , Tangen &; Richardson , 1985 ; Quereshi , 1960 ; Quereshi &; Fisher , 1977 ) . <p> It seems that items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offer unusual opportunities for investigating certain theoretical and practical problems in both cognitive psychology and psychometrics . Although letter or number series tests have been used in a number of well-known group ability batteries such as Primary Mental Abilities ( PMA ) ( Thurstone , 1938 ) , studies comparing female with male samples on letter or number series tests have not been reported in the PMA technical reports or any other relevant published source . <p> If there are no gender differences in performance on letter or number series items , we have available a universe of gender fair items for measuring inductive reasoning . In addition , a theory for the acquisition of rules for sequential patterns can be considered applicable to all regardless of their gender . We therefore attempted to investigate the gender differences in performance on letter series and number series tests in college undergraduates . We hypothesized that college women and college men would have equal means on letter series as well as number series tests . METHOD Subjects <p> Three hundred twenty undergraduates ( 160 women and 160 men ) from an introductory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study in exchange for some extra points toward their course grades . Chronologically , they were between 18 and 25 years and , ethnically , 97% were white and 3% were Asian American . Material <p> The Michill General Ability Test ( MOAT ) ( Quereshi , 1960 ) is a standardized test that has two forms ( LA and LB ) , each consisting of 44 letter series items . The two forms have parallel-form reliability of about .80 and concurrent validity ( correlation with Wechsler full-scale IQ ) of about .60 in samples of over 100 ( Erstad , 1988 Quereshi &; Fisher , 1977 ; Quereshi &; Ostrowski , 1985 ) . With the letter series items in MGAT forms LA and LB as the guides , we constructed two new forms NA and NB , each consisting of 44 number series items , such that each item in NA or NB was identical to a corresponding item in LA or LB in both composition and rule except that it employed two-digit numbers as the constituent units . Procedure <p> All 320 persons ( 160 women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 40 women and 40 men ) each but each person was assigned to a given group on a random basis . Group 1 ( n = 80 ) first completed the letter series form A ( LA ) and then the number series form A ( NA ) ; group 2 ( n = 80 ) first completed the NA and then LA form ; group 3 ( r ' = 80 ) first completed the letter series form B ( LB ) and then the number series form B ( NB ) ; and group 4 ( n = 80 ) first completed the NB and then the LB form . The tests were administered in a counter-balanced order during a single 2-fur session under essentially power conditions . Each 44-item test was accompanied by five practice problems and the following instructions : <p> Each problem in this test is arranged according to a certain rule of its own . You are to discover the rule and then provide the last letter/number in the row . See that there is a dot ( . ) at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row that you have to find out . Write this letter/number clearly in the space provided for answers . Data Analysis <p> Because we wanted to investigate the differences between the two genders on letter series and number series separately , the data were subjected to a 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) , with gender and forms as the two independent variables of two categories each and the letter series and number series as the two dependent variables . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <p> The MANOVA results are given in Table 1 . Although the multiple Fs are significant ( . p < .05 ) for both main effects ( gender and form ) , our major concern is the gender main effect as exhibited by either of the dependent variables ( letter series and number series ) . The univariate F ratios for the gender main effect show that the differences between the two genders are significant beyond the .05 level on the letter series tests but not on the number series . Examination of the means for the two genders indicates that the letter series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . <p> Because the interaction is not significant , the interpretation of the gender main effect is quite straightforward . We have found that , in our sample of college undergraduates , women have obtained significantly ( p < .05 ) higher scores on inductive reasoning as measured by letter series items , but no such difference exists on the number series tests . <p> Maccoby and Jacklin ( 1974 ) , after reviewing research dealing with gender differences on inductive/deductive reasoning , reached the following conclusions : <p> We have been unable to locate studies made since 1966 in which standardized reasoning tests have been given to subjects of high school age or older . The evidence from earlier work is that sexes do not differ on such measures as the reasoning subtest of the Primary Mental Abilities test . The two studies with this age group . . . show an advantage for females , but taking these studies in combination with earlier work , the overall picture remains one of little or no sex differences . ( pp. 108-110 ) <p> There are , however , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to 1966 , no studies could be located in which female adolescents or young adults were compared with male adolescents or young adults on PMA . Second , the PMA technical reports never presented either any data by gender or demonstrated the nonexistence of gender differences on reasoning or any other abilities measured by the PMA . <p> Even a more recent and comprehensive review ( Hyde , Fennema &; Eamon , 1990 ) does not provide any directly relevant information regarding the gender differences on cognitive tasks involving sequential patterns because letter/number series items are usually a part of tests of intelligence rather than tests of mathematical performance reviewed by Hyde et al . On the other hand , solutions of sequential problems may be conceptually similar to some tasks in mathematical problem solving and , thus , we could compare our results with some of those presented by Hyde et al . ( 1990 ) : <p> There was in the area of mathematical problem solving a slight female superiority or no gender difference in the elementary and middle school groups ; however , a moderate gender difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . ( p. 148 ) <p> In contrast , our results seem to indicate female superiority in sequential problem solving , using letter series items , even at the college level . In addition , we found no gender difference in sequential problem solving involving number series items in our sample of college students . <p> Halpern ( 1992 ) asserts that , " Evidence from a variety of sources supports the finding that , on the average , females have better verbal abilities than males " ( p. 64 ) . Our finding might be interpreted to indicate that female college students ' superiority on verbal skills may be generalizable to other processes ( e.g. , reasoning ) if they are tested by sequential semantic units . This should be an important finding if it is corroborated by further research , especially that involving different cultural and ethnic groups . In any case , any such differences mainly reflect the impact of cultural and social beliefs and practices at a given point in time , in the history of a given society , and require no elaborate explanation rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : March 1 , 1993 .

##4001478 This paper reports on the development of an Inventory of Managing Skills designed to provide working MBA students with a current assessment of their managing skills . A canonical correlation matrix reporting interrelationships between the 20 scale dimensions in a pilot sample of 378 respondents is reported . The Inventory can be used for self assessment by students and for other-assessment by the student 's superiors and peers . BACKGROUND <p> This paper reports on the development of an Inventory of Managing Skills ( IMS ) designed for use by working graduate students as an aid in forming an assessment of their current levels of management skills . Such an assessment could be helpful in tailoring short and long term career plans . <p> The need for a tool of this type arises from the increasing interest of graduate business faculties in providing students with opportunities to enhance individual management skills , such as decision-making , supervising , leadership , and communication . The American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business ( 1984,1989 ) provided a stimulus in 1976 when the " Outcome Measurement Project " was initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along two dimensions : cognitive knowledge and personal management skills . With respect to the skills enhancement objective , Smith and Mortenson ( 1988 ) undertook the development of specific course experiences aimed at helping students assess their current levels of management skills , plan developmental activities that respond to individual needs , and engage in skill development exercises on an in-class basis . <p> Procedures and methods generally employed for management skills assessment include assessment centers , situational tests , and paper-and-pencil inventories which use the self-assessments of the subject and/or assessments of the subject by others ; these may be used in combination to enhance process reliability . Since there are no commercially available management skills assessment inventories suitable for self or other assessment use with graduate students who are working adults , it was decided to develop an appropriate instrument . <p> The primary purpose of such a skills assessment inventory would be to provide the student with information on his/her current level of skill in each of several relevant management skills dimensions , supplementing assessment and evaluation information from other sources . Data from student skills inventories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other important respects : as a program evaluation device and as input to curriculum development deliberations . METHOD <p> To be useful for these purposes , a skills inventory should meet several design criteria . It should ( a ) tap several dimensions of behavior/skills that are relevant to supervisory and management jobs across multiple levels of responsibility , ( b ) measure such dimensions with acceptable reliability , and ( c ) present the self-assessor and other-assessors with an uncomplicated response task , perhaps requiring no more than about one hour to complete . <p> Dimensions and Items . An initial inventory design decision was made to present the respondent with a large number of specific behavioral items which relate to several broad dimensions of supervisor/management job performance . A variation on typical job analysis procedures was used to identify both the set of dimensions to be built into the inventory and the component items . <p> First , a review of the literature on supervisory or managerial behaviors , skills , and other personal characteristics was conducted , focusing on those elements that relate to successful job performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted involving groups of management and business school faculty , engineering school faculty , human resource management ( HRM ) administrators and executives , staff , operating and engineering supervisors/managers , and human resource development experts . Finally , the investigator drew on personal observations and judgments formed over an extensive career in HRM staff and technical management positions . <p> In each inquiry , the primary concern was to identify those supervisor/manager job behaviors , skills , and other attributes that characterize the performance of successful managers across several levels of responsibility . Based on these inputs , judgments were made identifying 20 dimensions of managing skills , involving 115 inventory items , for inclusion in the research draft of the Inventory of Managing Skills ( IMS ) . <p> Importance Analysis . As a further check on the relevance of the items selected for inclusion in the research draft of the IMS document , a special inventory form was prepared to obtain the item importance judgments of graduates of the University of Michigan-Dearborn MBA and Master of Engineering programs . A copy of the special inventory was mailed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; persons receiving master 's degrees between 1960 and 1989 were included . <p> The special inventory contained the same set of 115 items used in the student-peer-supervisor IMS documents , with appropriate modifications . Subjects were asked the question " How important is each of these items to successful performance on jobs like yours ? " Responses were made using the following five-point scale : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> A personal data section was included in this inventory , asking for advanced and undergraduate degree fields and dates , and current job assignment . Returns were received from 61 MBA graduates and 93 Master of Engineering graduates . The response rate was approximately 49% . Assessment Task <p> The 115 items were randomly sequenced within the IMS . Two inventory formats were developed : A student self-assessment format on which the respondent recorded her/his responses to inventory items , and an other-assessment format on which the student 's work supervisor ( or a work peer ) could assess the student . Students distributed the other-assessment documents to their supervisors and to peers of their own choice ; each inventory packet contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preprinted envelope in which the supervisor or peer could mail the completed form directly to the investigator . <p> In the self-assessment format , the student was asked to read each item and assess his/her level of skill in the designated area by recording a candid judgment using one of the following five rating categories : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This rating scale format was used on the inventory forms given to peers and supervisors with appropriate modifications of personal pronouns and verbs . Similarly , item wordings were adjusted slightly in the different formats to use appropriate language . <p> Each inventory form carried the student-subject 's name . A short personal data section was included at the end of each form of the inventory . The self-assessment form asked for job level and type and undergraduate degree . Peer and supervisory raters were asked to indicate the number of months ' work experience they had with the student . <p> A total of 156 graduate business students submitted self-assessment inventories , representing about 80% of the students who were offered the opportunity to participate . Responses were also received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; none of these raters indicated less than five months ' experience with the ratee , and all were included in the data set . RESULTS <p> Dimensions and Items . Item-dimension relationships and dimension scale reliabilities were analyzed in a two-staged process , combining the responses of students , peers and supervisors ( Nunnally , 1978 ) . <p> First , product-moment correlations were calculated between each item and each a priori dimension scale score . Any item that exhibited its highest correlation with the dimension to which it had been assigned on an a priori basis was retained ; eight items were removed from the IMS on this criterion . Next , the impact of each item on dimension reliability was assessed . Alpha values were calculated for each dimension , including and excluding each component item ; any item that did not add to its dimension alpha coefficient was dropped ; four items were removed on this criterion . The final dimension alpha values were judged to be acceptable and are shown in Table 1 , along with a listing of the final IMS dimensions and the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the IMS document was reduced in length from 115 items to 103 items . <p> A matrix of interdimension correlation coefficients is presented in Table 2 . <p> Graduates ' Importance Ratings . The item importance responses provided by the 152 MBA and Master of Engineering graduates were tabulated and averaged ; dimension scores for each respondent were calculated . <p> Two item-screening criteria were utilized . To be included in the final IMS item set , each item must achieve an average rating of at least 3.00 across the total sample , with a rating range which included one or more 5-ratings ( Critically Important ) . All items met these conditions . <p> The relatively small samples of business and engineering graduates precluded detailed cross-tabulation analysis , a cooperative research project is under way to obtain a larger graduate data pool . It might be of interest , however , to review the rank order of dimensions as determined from average dimension importance scores calculated across the entire sample ; that rank order is shown in the dimension lists in Tables 1 and 3 . Problem Solving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . DISCUSSION <p> Through the processes described here , an Inventory of Managing Skills was developed for use as a tool for self-assessment and other-assessment of working graduate students in business and engineering . Scale reliabilities are acceptable , and the inventory 's content validity characteristics are enhanced both by the process used in identifying items/dimensions and by the ratings of graduates whose present jobs are said to involve the items included in the IMS . Interdimension correlations are high , particularly among the " soft skills " areas , such as leadership , group interaction , and interpersonal effectiveness , probably due to the fundamentally positive interrelationships between these types of skills among effective supervisors and managers . <p> Informal contacts with respondent students and graduates suggests that the IMS has face validity . Inventory completion times of 45-65 minutes were reported . <p> The Inventory of Management Skills is intended to be used in combination with other assessment processes , such as situational tests and assessment center techniques . To the extent that additional measures are available on those skill dimensions considered to be among the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is value to self-assessment , together with assessments by work associates ; the impact is multiplied when supplemented by other sources of evaluation .

They spoke of poisons exuding from toxic waste dumps ... the pollution of air , water , soil ... extinction of plant and animal species ... deforestation ... spreading deserts ... the suffering in animal laboratories and farm factories ... chemical additives in food and drink ... friends and relatives dying from spreading epidemics of cancer . <p> The ecological crisis these developments produce does not stand apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common thread weaving through issues of the arms race and human oppression . Just as concentrations of wealth push the poor onto marginal , easily erodable lands , so does the drive for profit demolish our oxygen-producing forests and put carcinogenic pesticides and preservatives into our food . And so does manufacture of weapons threaten us with the radioactive horrors of our own Chernobyl disaster . The four Defense Department reactors are of similar design to the Soviet one that burned out of control ( with graphite and no containment domes ) , the only difference being that ours are older and more decrepit . Yet they are kept in operation to produce plutonium for the 17,000 additional missiles that the Reagan administration wants to build . Our addictions to profit and power , and to the lifestyles they sustain , turn the world toxic . <p> These addictions culminate in an ecological crisis that is the ultimate expression of a human mistake . It is a mistake about our place in the order of things , the delusion that we can -- as corporations or as nations or as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are put here to rule , aloo ! from the rest of creation . It is the fantasy that we can be immune to what we do to other beings . It is the denial of our deep systemic interdependence . <p> Fortunately , another perspective is emerging as a healing corrective . Ecology teaches us that we humans are neither the rulers nor the center of the universe , but are imbedded in a vast living matrix and subject to its laws of reciprocity . " Deep ecology " is a term coined by Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess , to contrast with " shallow environmentalism , " a band-aid approach applying piecemeal technological fixes for short-term human goals . Deep ecology represents a basic shift in ways of seeing and valuing , a shift beyond anthropocentrism . <p> Anthropocentrism means human chauvinism . Similar to sexism. but substitute human race for man and all other species for woman . <p> When humans investigate and see through their layers of anthropocentric self-cherishing , a most profound change in consciousness begins to take place . Alienation subsides . The human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief then ! The thousands of years of imagined separation are over and we begin to recall our true nature . That is. the change is a spiritual one ... sometimes referred to as deep ecology . -- John Seed <p> <p> There are , of course , manifold ways of evoking or provoking this change in perspective . Methods for inspiring the experience of deep ecology range from prayer to poetry , from wilderness vision quests to the induction of altered states of consciousness . The most reliable , perhaps , is direct action in defense of Earth . <p> In deep ecology workshops there are three genetic approaches that I have found especially suitable for groups . They consist of mourning , then remembering , then speaking from the perspective of other life-forms . <p> Deep ecology remains a concept without the power to transform our awareness , unless we allow ourselves no feel -- which means feeling the pain within us over what is happening to our world . The workshop serves as a safe place where this pain can be acknowledged , plumbed , released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is slipping away -- ancient forests and clean rivers , birdsong , and breathable air . It is appropriate , then , to mourn -- for once at least , to speak our sorrow and , when appropriate , to say goodbye to what is disappearing from our lives . As participants let this happen , in the whole group or in small dusters , there is hopelessness expressed . There is also something more : a rage welling up and passionate caring . <p> Only if one loves this earth with unbending passion can one release one 's sadness . -- Don Juan in Carlos Castaneda 's Tales of Power <p> <p> Our interconnectedness emerges as the ground of this anger and grief . Why else do we weep for other beings and those not yet born ? There 's no cause for so great a sadness if at root we are not one . Deep ecology serves as the explanatory principle both for the pain we experience on behalf of our planet and its beings and for the sense of belonging that arises when we stop repressing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As organic expressions of life on earth , we have a long and panoramic history . We are not yesterday 's children , nor are we limited to this one brief moment of our planet 's story ; our roots go back to the beginning of time . We can learn to remember them . The knowledge is in us . As in our mothers ' wombs our embryonic bodies recapitulated the evolution of cellular life on earth , so we can now do it consciously , harnessing intellect and the power of imagination . We can reclaim our history in order to know afresh our deep ecology . <p> As your memory improves , as the implications of evolution and ecology are internalized and replace outmoded anthropocentric structures in your mind , there is an identification with all life . Then follows the realization that the distinction between life and lifeless is a human construct . Every atom in this body existed before organic life emerged ... Remember our childhood as minerals , as lava , as rocks ? <p> Rocks contain the potentiality to weave themselves into such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do we look down upon them with such a condescending air . It is they that are the immortal part of us. -- John Seed <p> <p> Certain methods help trigger this remembering . Guided visualizations can take us through our four and a half billion year story , making it present and vivid . One form this can take is the Gala Meditation I adapted from letters from John Seed , who is a member of Interhelp Australia and director of the Rainforest Information Center . Sometimes we use a drum to sound a heartbeat , suggesting our connection with the pulse of life in all beings through time . <p> Our evolutionary journey can also be explored through body movement . Nosing , crawling , wriggling , pushing up , we can begin literally to feel the inner body sense of amphibian and reptile and lower mammal , because these earlier stages of our life are imbedded in our neurological system . John Seed and his colleagues in Interhelp Australia accord a lot of time to this exercise , allowing participants to move through many previous evolutionary forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was striking , " reported one , " was that modern human was the most disconcerting to me . " <p> It is to be noted in this connection that nonhuman memories can surface with particular intensity and authenticity when consciousness is altered by special accelerated patterns of breathing . Stanislav and Christina Grof developed what they call holotropic breathing to permit subjects to recapture and resolve significant experiences surrounding their birth . They have found that the material that comes to light often goes beyond the biographical and even the human realm to include phylogenetic sequences and episodes of conscious identification with other species and life forms . These are so real as to produce remarkable insights into specificities of animal behavior , botanical processes , and even inorganic interactions of inanimate matter . A version of this breathwork has been used to similar effect in the Eco-Breath workshops held in Australia . <p> This we know . The earth does not belong to man ; man belongs to the earth . Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of earth . This we know . All things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are connected . -- Chief Seattle <p> <p> Ordinary . consciousness is certainly sufficient to allow us to shake off for a while our solely human identification and imaginatively to enter the experience of other life-forms . It is as satisfying to do this as to resurrect a half-forgotten skill or sing , after years , a once familiar song . The workshop helps us feel our way . We choose -- or , as I prefer to put it , let ourselves be chosen by -- another life-form . We give it our attention , we give it our voice , we practice speaking for it in small groups where others , listening , can elicit from us more . We play tapes of environmental sounds , sometimes let hoots and howls , wind and water noises , come through our throats , hearken to inner intuitions , stretch to see and feel what lies just barely beyond our human knowings . <p> The Council of All Beings is the culminating ritual form , in which participants formally speak on behalf of these other beings . Because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing and always different . It originated in Australia in early 1985 , after a Despair and Empowerment workshop that included environmental activists . These " rainbow warriors " had done direct action on behalf of Earth , interposing their bodies to stop French nuclear testing in the South Pacific and to protect the remaining stands of rainforest in New South Wales and Queensland . John Seed was one of them , and the Council of All Beings resulted from our encounter . <p> It is not all that strange to imagine ourselves in nonhuman forms and draw fresh vision from them . Poets and children do it , shamans and primal people know that gift . The Lord Buddha himself , it is believed , developed his perfection of compassion through numerous animal incarnations ; the Jataka at " birth " tales of his lives in such forms as rabbit , monkey , tiger , elephant , serve still as models of bravery and selflessness . The interconnectedness -- or , more precisely , the interexistence -- of all beings is expressed in the Buddhist vision of reality known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ node of the net , each being like a gem reflects all the others , as those for their part mirror back all the rest , the reflections catching back and forth . <p> Today explorations into quantum physics , systems theory , holography and morphogenetic fields offer similar perspectives on the structure of the universe . The many transbiographical and trans-species experiences occuring throughout his years of psychophysical work with people have led Dr. Graf to conclude that : <p> In a yet unexplained way each human being contains the information about the entire universe or all of existence , has potential experiential access to all its parts , and in a sense is the whole cosmic network , as much as he or she is just an infinitesimal of it , a separate and insignificant biological entity . <p> It follows then that deep ecology can empower us . As we open to the radical interrelatedness of all that is , fresh vision and vigor can be gained for our work in the world . Actions on behalf of Earth are strengthened , less limited by self-doubt , self-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am protecting the rainforest " develops to " I am part of the rainforest protecting myself . " And it is good that that is so , for the crises we confront in this planet-time demand more of us than business-as-usual . They require depths of wisdom and courage that appear to exceed our individual resources . Yet these become available to us , as we break free of the prison cell of isolated human ego and open to our deep ecology . <p> In religious language and experience , the sense of being sustained by a source beyond our self , by a power that is not our own possession , is known as grace . In this time of almost overwhelming peril , grace comes -- as indeed it always has -- in many forms . One of them is the Council of All Beings when , near the end , a shift occurs . <p> A voice -- the ritual leader 's -- speaks on behalf of the humans , those who at any point are sitting silent in the center of the circle , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-creatures . We know we are wrecking the world and we are afraid . What we have unleashed has such momentum now , we do n't know how to turn it around . Do n't leave us alone , we need your help . You need us too for your own survival . Are there powers you can share with us ? <p> Without any other announcement , this plea signals a turning . The beings in the circle respond spontaneously , <p> I , lichen , work slowly , very slowly . Time is my friend . This is what I give you : patience for the long haul and perseverance . <p> By offering them , naming them , the participants in the ritual invoke the powers within themselves that they want strengthened . These powers are available to us all because they inhere in the web of life and because , in the final analysis , that web is what we are . By virtue of the long planetary journey we have made , and the processes still at work within us , that deep ecology is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now in this time of danger . <p> It is a dark time . As deep-diving trout I offer you my fearlessness of the dark . <p> I , lion , give you my roar , the voice to , speak out and be heard . <p> I am caterpillar . The leaves I eat taste bitter now . But dimly I sense a great change coming . What I offer you , humans , is my willingness to dissolve and transform . I do that without knowing what the end-result will be ; so I share with you my courage too . <p> 
##4001150 ABSTRACT . Sixty undergraduate subjects were exposed to one of three depressive mood inductions : cognitive , behavioral , or control . Subjects in the cognitive induction group read negative self-statements consistent with Beck 's ( 1974 ) cognitive theory of depression . Subjects in the behavioral induction group were exposed to insoluble discrimination problems consistent with Lewinsohn 's ( 1974 ) behavioral theory that lack of reinforcement produces depression . The control group read a neutral passage . Following the mood induction , subjects rated their current moods using the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist ( MAACL ; Zuckerman &; Lubin , 1965 ) . The cognitive and behavioral inductions produced significantly higher MAACL total and subscale scores than did the control condition ; however , the cognitive and behavioral inductions did not differ from one another . Because the cognitive and behavioral mood inductions appear equally powerful , they may be used by researchers who are attempting to identify variables that are related to subjects ' differing responses to behavioral and cognitive influences on depression . <p> COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL MODELS of depression have become increasingly influential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) cognitive theory and Lewinsohn 's ( 1974 ) behavioral theory have both generated substantial research on the cause and treatment of depression . To date , evaluations of cognitive and behavioral therapy for depression have shown that both treatments are effective but that there is no clear support for the greater efficacy of one over the other ( Sacco &; Beck , 1985 ) . Rehm , Kaslow , and Rabin ( 1987 ) attempted to identify variables that predict responses to cognitive versus behavior therapy . To date , however , there are no clear indicators as to which approach will be more effective for a client . <p> Rexford and Wierzbicki ( 1989 ) suggested that laboratory mood induction studies might help identify variables that predispose one to respond to cognitive versus behavioral therapy . They developed cognitive and behavioral mood inductions and found that both were effective in inducing negative mood but were unable to identify the variables that predicted different responses to cognitive and behavioral inductions . <p> One problem with Rexford and Wierzbicki 's study was that its behavioral induction had subjects read about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavioral induction could be regarded as cognitive . Rexford and Wierzbicki suggested that future researchers use behavioral inductions in which subjects actually experience negative events . <p> Hiroto and Seligman ( 1975 ) administered insoluble problems to subjects and observed that they exhibited decreased learning . Others found that exposure to insoluble problems increased depressed affect ( Sedek &; Kofta , 1990 ; Trice , 1982 , 1985 ) . <p> The purpose of this study was to compare the intensities of a cognitive and a behavioral mood induction . If the two types proved equally intense , researchers might then use them in efforts to identify variables that predict different responses to cognitive and behavioral therapy . Method <p> Subjects and Procedure <p> Subjects were 60 college students ( 49 women , 11 men ) in undergraduate psychology courses at Marquette University ; the students received extra course credit for volunteering to participate in research . <p> Subjects met individually with an experimenter , who assigned twenty subjects randomly to each of three mood induction groups : cognitive , behavioral , and control . The cognitive and behavioral induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.6 min ) . Subjects in the control condition read a passage of text for 12 min . After completing this procedure , subjects evaluated their moods , using the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List ( MAACL ; Zuckerman &; Lubin , 1965 ) . Subjects were then debriefed . Those who had been exposed to the depressive mood inductions were exposed to an elating induction designed to remove any remaining negative affect . <p> Materials <p> The behavioral mood induction consisted of a set of insoluble discrimination problems described by Hiroto and Seligman ( 1975 ) . Subjects were first administered one sample problem consisting of a series of five cards , each with two stimulus patterns . Each pattern contained five dichotomous dimensions : a letter ( X or Y ) , a color ( red or blue ) , a size ( large or small ) , a border ( square or circle ) , and a border line ( solid or dashed ) . <p> The subjects were told that each pattern contained only one value for each of the five dimensions and that 1 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess which of the two patterns on each card contained the target value , after which they were told whether they were correct or incorrect . Using this feedback , the subjects tried to identify the target value for the problem . Subjects viewed each card for a maximum of 15 s ; after 10 s , subjects were told that they must make a selection in 5 s . <p> The subjects were then administered the sample problem , after which they were given the opportunity to ask questions about the procedure . We then administered three discrimination problems similar to the sample problem except that they consisted of 10 cards each and only four stimulus dimensions ( border line was omitted ) . Two other dimensions differed slightly from the sample problem : letter ( A or T ) and color ( black or white ) . <p> Feedback ( whether selections were correct or incorrect ) was provided on a predetermined schedule , independent of the subjects ' actual selections . After the last card in a problem was viewed , the subjects were asked to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects were told that their answers were incorrect . <p> After the first two problems , the subjects were told that a new 10-card problem would be presented and that a new target value may or may not have been chosen . The same procedures were used for each of the three problems . Insoluble discrimination problems have been shown to decrease ability to solve later problems ( Hiroto &; Seligman , 1975 ) and to increase depressed mood ( Sedek &; Kofta , 1990 ; Trice , 1982 , 1985 ) . <p> The cognitive mood induction was modeled after Velten 's ( 1968 ) procedure in which subjects read 59 depressing self-statements . Rexford and Wierzbicki ( 1989 ) identified 59 statements of negative thoughts and thinking errors , consistent with Beck 's theory of depression , that were matched for severity with Velten 's statements . Velten 's instructions were used , with each step printed on an index card . After the instructions , subjects read a series of statements printed on index cards . Velten 's initial statement appeared first : " Today is neither better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 59 statements used by Rexford and Wierzbicki were presented . The other 18 statements were omitted so that the two induction procedures would take the same time . An analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) showed that this subset of 41 and the original set of 59 statements did not differ in mean severity , F(1,98) = 1.77 , ns . <p> Subjects in the control condition read a passage on psychotherapy from an introductory psychology textbook ( Kalat , 1990 ) . We selected this passage because it had not been assigned to subjects during the semester and because we judged it to be neutral with respect to mood . Subjects were told that they would not be tested on this material , and they read for 12 min . <p> The MAACL ( Zuckerman &; Lubin , 1965 ) was administered after the mood induction or control condition . The MAACL consists of 132 adjectives that are endorsed if they describe how subjects currently feel ; it provides measures of depression , anxiety , and hostility and has been shown to be both a reliable ( Pankratz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid index of negative mood ( Nagata &; Trierweiler , 1988 ) . It has commonly been used to assess the effects of laboratory mood inductions ( e.g. , Nagata &; Trierweiler , 1988 ; Rexford &; Wierzbicki , 1989 ; Schare &; Lisman , 1984 ) . <p> Following debriefing , the subjects who had been exposed to the mood inductions were exposed to an elating mood induction . This consisted of reading 30 positive self-statements developed by Velten ( 1968 ) . These statements have been used to remove any remaining effects of depressive mood inductions ( Frost &; Green , 1982 ; Rexford &; Wierzbicki , 1989 ) . Results <p> We summed the MAACL subscale scores to produce the MAACL total score , which has been interpreted as an index of general negative affect ( Pankratz et al. , 1972 ; Turzo &; Range , 1991 ) . Using ANOVA , we determined that the MAACL total scores differed significantly across groups , F(2,57) = 7.30 , p < .01 . Scheffe tests showed that the cognitive and behavioral groups both differed significantly ( p < .05 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behavioral groups did not differ ( Table 1 ) . <p> A multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) using Wilks 's lambda criterion determined that MAACL subscale scores did not differ by gender , F(3,52) = 2.27 , ns , or in the interaction between gender and group , F(6,104) = 1.03 , ns . However , MAACL subscale scores did differ across groups , F(6,104) = 2.35 , p < .05 . <p> Univariate ANOVAs showed that the MAACL Anxiety , F(2,54) = 3.41 , p < .05 , and Hostility , F(2,54) = 5.05 , p < .01 , subscales differed across groups , although the MAACL Depression subscale did not , F(2,54) = 2.03 , ns . Planned comparisons showed that the behavioral and cognitive inductions did not differ from one another on the MAACL Depression ( t = 0.46 , ns ) , Anxiety ( t = 0.32 , ns ) , or Hostility ( t = 1.85 , ns ) subscales . However , the combined behavioral and cognitive inductions differed from the control condition on the Anxiety ( t = -2.44 , p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p < .05 ) subscales , and almost differed significantly on the Depression subscale ( t = -1.81 , p < .10 ) . Table 1 contains the group means on the MAACL subscale scores . Discussion <p> This study compared the effects of a cognitive and a behavioral depressive mood induction . The two procedures did not differ in severity , but both produced significantly more negative mood than a control condition . <p> Exposure to a set of insoluble problems produced a significant increase in negative affect consistent with Lewinsohn 's ( 1974 ) behavioral model , which posits that low reinforcement leads to depression , and with previous studies ( Hiroto &; Seligman , 1975 ; Trice , 1982 , 1985 ) showing that exposure to insoluble problems increases negative affect . <p> The cognitive procedure also induced negative mood . This is consistent with Beck 's ( 1974 ) theory that depression is caused by cognitive factors , such as automatic negative thoughts and thinking errors . Many studies have now shown that Velten 's ( 1968 ) procedure induces depressed mood ( Larsen &; Sinnett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( 1989 ) finding that a Velten-like induction consisting solely of statements consistent with Beck 's cognitive theory induces negative affect . <p> Previous research addressed how psychological variables moderate the effects of laboratory mood inductions . For example , responding to Velten-like inductions of depressed mood has been found to be related to personality characteristics , such as self-consciousness ( Scheier &; Carver , 1977 ) and neuroticism ( Hill , 1985 ) and to cognitive processes such as frequent automatic negative thoughts ( Blackburn , Cameron , &; Deary , 1990 ) . <p> Because the cognitive and behavioral inductions in this study were equally powerful , future studies may use both these procedures in attempts to identify variables that predict different responses to cognitive and behavioral therapy . In this way , laboratory mood induction studies may help to identify people who have different susceptibilities to cognitive and behavioral influences on depression and who may respond differently to cognitive and behavioral treatments of depression . <p> TABLE 1 <p> Mean MAACL Total and Subscale Scores Across Induction Groups PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> <p> 
##4001151 ABSTRACT . Ethical values of 171 college students at California State University , Chico , were measured , using a subset of the Rokeach ( 1968,1971 ) Value Survey . Non-parametric statistical analysis , four value measures , and four different consistent tests of significance and probability showed , surprisingly , that the younger students were more ethical than the older students . College students under 21 scored significantly higher ethically on three out of the four measures . Younger college students valued equality , freedom , and honesty more than their older classmates did . Surprisingly also , the younger students were significantly more concerned with being helpful and intellectual and were less involved in pursuing an exciting life and in social recognition than were the older students . <p> AGE AND ETHICS are generally believed to be related ( Kohlberg , 1984 ) . The common understanding that " older is wiser " means that age advances mental , emotional , social , and moral maturity ( Glenn , 1992 ) . Several recent studies report relationships between age and ethics . Serwinek ( 1992 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did indeed explain variance in ethical viewpoints .. Burnett and Karson ( 1987 ) , Posner and Schmidt ( 1984 ) and Arlow ( 1991 ) found that older people become more conservative in their ethical viewpoints . Younger employees tend to have a more liberal view of potentially unethical situations ( Grant &; Broom , 1988 ) , whereas older workers tend to have somewhat more adamant opinions about what should be considered acceptable behavior ( Brenner , 1988 ) . <p> Older people have had more opportunity to see the consequences of unethical behavior ( Wood , Longenecker , McKinney , &; Moore , 1988 ) and are more likely to realize from experience that the unethical eventually suffer the consequences of their actions ( Miesling &; Preble , 1985 ) . Also , a longer , continuous exposure to tradition and custom appears to be a major explanation of why a person 's age is a significant predictor of ethical values ( Mudrack , 1989 ) . In short , age has been the most influential demographic predictor of ethical standards . As age increases , subjects have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromising interpretations of what is to be judged ethical . <p> For more than 25 years , the Rokeach Value Survey has been a commonly used research instrument to measure human beliefs , attitudes , and values ( Rokeach , 1968a , 1968b ) . Personal and organizational change have also frequently been measured using this instrument , and human values and value systems have been studied for more than 20 years using this methodology ( Rokeach , 1971 ; Sikula , 1972 ) . Some early value research has indirectly used the Rokeach Value Survey to measure religious values , but to the best of our knowledge , this study is one of the first attempts to define ethical values in terms of this survey . <p> The Rokeach Value Survey consists of two parts : 18 terminal ends and 18 instrumental means . Each set of 18 values is arranged in alphabetical order . Respondents are asked to arrange the 18 values in order of their importance as guiding principles of life from 1 ( most important ) to 18 ( least important ) . <p> Our purposes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , using student subjects , to determine whether younger ( 21 or under ) and older ( 22 or over ) students have different ethical values . We defined ethical values in terms of the Rokeach Value Survey as a subset of the terminal ends and the instrumental means . Two terminal ends and two instrumental means constitute ethical values . Thus , the ethical values are equality , freedom , honesty , and responsibility . Method <p> Subjects <p> Subjects were 171 students in three different sections of the introductory , junior , and senior level Management and Organization course , all taught by the same professor at California State University , Chico , during the spring semester of 1992 . Each student filled out a Rokeach Value Survey about 1 month into the semester . Actually , 211 students filled out surveys , but 40 were not used for a variety of reasons pertaining to incomplete information . <p> The 171 students were mostly college juniors and seniors , although a few were sophomores or graduate students . The subjects were divided into two groups , 21 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is the legal age for voting ( and drinking ) in many states and because it split the subjects almost evenly in half ( 80 vs. 91 , respectively ) . California State University at Chico is a residential campus in a rural town and attracts largely traditional college-aged students . Although some students take more than 4 years to complete their degrees , most juniors and seniors are relatively young compared with students in urban communities where working people take part-time loads and evening classes . We ran data on age splits at 25 and 30 in addition to 21 , but the older samples were so small that we were not confident in the numbers . Of the total 171 students only 22 were over 25 and only 8 were over 30 . <p> The professor designed the course so that it contained a heavy dose of ethical and moral information , although management processes and functions remained the basic subject matter and format of the course . Topics included planning , organizing , controlling , leading , staffing , motivating , communicating , and decision making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international subject matter . The professor focused on each topic for about 1 week , and each topic contained at least some discussion of its ethical aspects and moral implications . <p> Statistical Analysis <p> Because nominal ranking scales instead of ordinal intervals are involved when using the Rokeach Value Survey , nonparametric statistics rather than parametric statistical analysis had to be used for comparing the two groups in this study . Several references are provided here for the reader interested in becoming more familiar with nonparametric statistical tests ( Conover , 1980 ; Hayek , 1969 ; Lehmann , 1975 ; Quade , 1966 ) . <p> To answer the questions raised in this study and to provide the appropriate statistical analysis , we used four nonparametric tests to determine the differences in ran.kings between younger and older students . These four nonparametric tests almost always gave the same conclusions regarding the significance of the findings and probabilities at the traditional level of .05 , and thus reinforced one another in terms of the reported results of this research . The following four nonparametric procedures and tests were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-sample test with normal approximation and continuity correction Kruskal-Wallis test with a chi-square approximation Median two-sample test with normal approximation Median one-way analysis with a chi-square approximation Results <p> Table 1 contains the medians , ranks , and quartile deviations of the terminal ends for the 80 students aged 21 or younger and for the 91 students aged 22 or older . The value ranking differences for the two age groups indicated that five terminal values had a spread of five or more between the rankings of the younger and older students . An exciting life , a world at peace , equality , inner harmony , and social recognition had spreads of five or more between younger and older student rankings . <p> Table 2 contains the medians , ranks , and quartile deviations of the instrumental means for the 80 students aged 21 or younger and for the 91 students aged 22 or older ; these data indicate that six instrumental values had a spread of five or more between the rankings of the younger and older students . Cheerful , forgiving , helpful , intellectual , logical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and older student rankings . <p> First impressions are often inaccurate , however , and they are not scientifically determined . A quick look at the medians and quartile deviations reported in Tables 1 and 2 give a slightly different picture than that seen when simply comparing ranks . We also used the four companion tests of probability and significance to examine the frequency distributions of all the rankings by every student . Wilcoxon , Kruskal-Wallis , median two-sample , and median one-way probability tests were applied to all 36 Rokeach values . <p> Just as first impressions are right only about half the time , 6 of the 11 values that passed the visual inspection of the 5 or more rankings spread test failed the statistical analysis examination . To pass the probability benchmark , we required that all four probability tests of significance be in agreement , but we did stretch the traditional limit of .05 to .06 to capture two values . Two terminal ends , a world at peace and inner harmony , and four instrumental means , cheerful , forgiving , logical , and polite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups of students . Thus , only five values survived the probability standard : three terminal ends , an exciting life , equality , and social recognition , and two instrumental means , helpful and intellectual . <p> In a final analysis , we first investigated significance by examining spreads of five or more between younger and older student rankings of the terminal and instrumental values . At this point , the question was , Can any other of the 36 total values pass the probability criterion ( all four probability tests at .06 or greater significance ) even though they failed the observation benchmark ( five or more ranks between younger and older student rankings ) ? The answer was yes . An examination of the total data base showed that one more terminal end , freedom , and one more instrumental mean , honesty , passed the probability requirement . Although the ranking difference for freedom was only two , when the frequency distributions were tested for significance differences , the point .003 level was surprisingly obtained in all four tests . Honesty was also added as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they both ranked it as number 1 . Table 2 reported a median difference of 3.0 for the two age groups on honesty . Discussion <p> For a finding to qualify as a conclusion in this study , we required that it pass the four-fold probability standard . Three out of the four ethical values identified earlier in this report qualified as conclusions because they were significantly valued differently by younger and older students , as determined by the probability standard . Along with past research and human intuition , this study showed that ethical values were significantly different between the junior and senior students . Surprisingly , however , the younger students placed a higher value on equality , freedom , and honesty than did the older students . Remembering that , in the Rokeach Value Survey , ranks with lower numbers reveal higher priority and importance , younger students ranked freedom number 3 ; older students ranked it fifth in order of importance . Younger students ranked equality number 8 ; older students ranked it 13th . Both student groups ranked honesty number 1 , but the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older students . <p> Our results showed that age and ethics are related . Historically , older people have been shown to be more ethical than younger people . The reverse ' was true in this study , perhaps because there was not enough difference in age between the two groups . Only 22 of the 171 student sample were over 25 ; only 8 were older than 30 . The older students were more often products of the 1980s ; the younger students were products of the 1990s . But for a number of reasons , we believe that perhaps the best explanation for our findings is that colleges and universities are doing a better job in the 1990s than in the 1980s in teaching ethical values and environmental concerns . Part of the explanation may also be youthful idealism . <p> With regard to nonethical values , two terminal values , an exciting life and social recognition , and two instrumental values , being helpful and intellectual , passed the fourfold probability test . Again , surprisingly , older students , by five ranks , valued an exciting life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put less value on social recognition than did their elders ( by six ranks ) . Younger students also valued being helpful more than the students 4 to 7 years older ( by seven ranks ) and being intellectual ( by six ranks ) . Based on the results of this study , in which the age range was admittedly extremely narrow , younger college-aged baccalaureate students seem to be significantly more ethical than older college-aged undergraduate students . <p> TABLE 1 <p> Medians , Ranks , and Quartile Deviations for Two Age Groups PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> TABLE 2 <p> Medians , Ranks , and Quartile Deviations for Two Age Groups PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> <p> 
##4001152 ABSTRACT . Interpersonal dependency and locus of control orientation were studied in obese and nonobese samples . The Interpersonal Dependency Inventory ( Hirschfeld , Klerman , Gough , Barrett , &; Korchin , 1977 ) and the I-E Scale ( Rotter , 1966 ) were administered to 106 obese adults in outpatient treatment for obesity . The I-E Scale was also administered to 97 nonobese control subjects . As predicted , the obese subjects were significantly more internally oriented than has been previously identified in obese populations . These findings challenge currently held assumptions about locus of control in obese groups . Although the obese and nonobese subjects maintained similar overall dependency scores , the obese subjects were more likely to show low levels of autonomy in comparison with the nonobese subjects . Interpersonal dependency and locus of control dimensions associated with obese conditions may serve as useful predictor variables influencing obesity treatment approaches and outcome . <p> THE PERSONALITY DYNAMICS and psychological characteristics of obese individuals have been exhaustively researched ( Kaplan &; Kaplan , 1957 ; McReynolds , 1982 ; Slochower , 1987 ) . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Brownell &; Foreyt , 1986 ) , in most contemporary paradigms researchers view obesity as multiply determined ( Kuldau , Rand , &; Tucker , 1982 ; Nash , 1987 ; Striegel-Moore &; Rodin , 1986 ) . In several investigations , researchers have examined psychological variables in obese individuals and have focused on personality correlates assumed to contribute to and maintain obesity . <p> Numerous research findings have associated personality characteristics of obese people with dependency , passivity , low assertiveness , self-consciousness , and low self-esteem ( Jacobs &; Wagner , 1984 ; Klesges , 1984 ; Mattlar , Salminen , &; Alanen , 1989 ; McReynolds , 1982 ; Stein , 1987 ) . Hirschfeld , Klerman , Gough , Barrett , and Korchin ( 1977 ) reported that interpersonal dependency is highly associated with the psychogenesis of addictive and psychiatric disorders . Hirschfeld et al . devised the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory ( IDI ) , which measures how much individuals need to associate with , interact with , and rely on others . As a personality construct , inter-personal dependency is conceptualized from the psychoanalytic theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ethological theory of attachment . To date , there have been no reported studies that have used the IDI with obese populations . I hypothesized that the obese sample in this study would score higher on all levels of dependency , as measured by the IDI , than the normative sample in the Hirschfeld et al . ( 1977 ) study . <p> The psychological construct of locus of control ( LOC ) orientation of obese populations has also been studied extensively . Locus of control , developed by Rotter , Seeman , and Liverant ( 1962 ) within the context of Rotter 's ( 1954 ) social learning theory , refers to how much control individuals believe they have over their lives . Researchers report that internal control orientation may be an important factor associated with successful weight reduction and the maintenance of weight loss ( Balch &; Ross , 1975 ; Cohen &; Alpert , 1978 ; Jeffrey , 1974 ; Kincey , 1983 ; Saltzer , 1982 ) . However , contradictory findings have indicated that control orientation is not a reliable predictor for successful weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald , 1977 ) . <p> In several studies that measured locus of control in obese populations , using Rotter 's ( 1966 ) Internal-External ( I-E ) Scale , researchers found that obese adult subjects ' mean scores were within the external range of control orientation ( Balch &; Ross , 1975 ; Gormanous &; Lowe , 1975 ; Tobias &; MacDonald , 1977 ) when compared with Rotter 's ( 1966 ) original normative samples . Although most research supports the notion that obese populations demonstrate an external control orientation , results from recent studies challenge this assumption. -1 ( Mills , 1991 a , 1991 b ) examined LOC in both male and female obese adult populations before the subjects entered an outpatient obesity treatment program and discovered that the subjects demonstrated an internal control orientation . Therefore , I further hypothesized that the obese subjects in this study would demonstrate an internal locus of control . Method <p> The sample consisted of 106 obese adults ( 93 women and 13 men ) and 97 adult controls ( 51 women and 46 men ) . The mean age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.5 ) , and the mean age for the control group was 21 years ( SD = 2.7 ) . The obese subjects were involved in an intensive outpatient treatment program for obesity and were recruited from two medically supervised weight-loss programs located in large metropolitan cities in the Midwest . The control group was recruited from three introductory psychology classes from Lewis University . The obese subject pool consisted of moderately to morbidly obese adults who had been medically diagnosed according to clinical standards for obesity . The subjects were at least 50 lb over their ideal weight ( according to established normal height and weight tables ) when they entered the treatment program . The obesity treatment program consisted of comprehensive medical , psychological , behavioral , and nutritional interventions . Rotter 's ( 1966 ) I-E Scale and the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory ( Hirschfeld et al. , 1977 ) were administered in a standardized fashion to the obese subjects during the initial screening process before they entered treatment for obesity . The I-E Scale was also administered to the control group in a standardized group format . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation was voluntary . Results <p> The LOC mean score for the total obese sample ( N = 106 ) on Rotter 's ( 1966 ) I-E Scale was 7.7 ( SD = 3.8 ) . The mean for the female obese subjects ( N = 93 ) was 7.8 ( SD = 3.8 ) , and the mean for the male obese subjects ( N = 13 ) was 7.3 ( SD = 4.0 ) . Results of a two-tailed t test that compared these groups were not statistically significant , t(104) = .46 , p > .05 . The results suggest that there were no differences in LOC orientation between the female and male obese subjects . The LOC mean score for the total control group ( N = 97 ) was 10.1 ( SD = 3.8 ) . The mean for the female control subjects ( N = 51 ) was 9.78 ( SD = 3.6 ) , and the mean for the male control subjects ( N = 46 ) was 10.22 ( SD = 3.9 ) . No statistical differences were found between the female and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p > .05 . However , the results of a two-tailed t test that compared the obese subjects ' and non-obese subjects ' LOC scores were statistically significant , t(201) = 4.33 , p < .001 . As predicted , the obese subjects demonstrated a significantly greater internal control orientation than the nonobese controls . The findings also support the notion that the obese adults in this study had higher degrees of internal LOC than has been previously recognized in obese populations . <p> The relationship between LOC and a reported history of family obesity was examined in the obese sample . The LOC mean score for the obese subjects who reported a history of obesity in their families ( N = 90 ) was 8.0 ( SD = 3.9 ) , whereas the mean LOC score for the obese subjects with no history of family obesity ( N = 16 ) was 6.1 ( SD = 3.2 ) . Results of a two-tailed t test that compared these two groups were statistically significant , t(104) = 2.15 , p < .05 . These results suggest that the obese subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the obese subjects with no history of family obesity were very internally oriented . <p> The mean scores on the IDI were examined for the obese sample ( N = 66 ) and for the original normative sample ( N = 220 ; Hirschfeld et al. , 1977 ) . On Scale 1 of the IDI ( Emotional Reliance on Another Person ) , the-me , an score for the entire obese sample was 39.0 ( SD = 7.9 ) . The mean for the female obese subjects ( N = 58 ) was 38.9 ( SD = 8.2 ) , and the mean score for the male obese subjects ( N = 8 ) was 39.7 ( SD = 5.2 ) . Results of a two-tailed t test that compared the obese women and men were not statistically significant , t(64) = .28 , p > .05 . The mean scores of the obese subjects and the mean scores of the original normative sample showed no statistically significant differences on reported levels of emotional dependence on others , M = 39.2 ( SD = 7.8 ) , t(284) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scale 2 ( Lack of Social Self-Confidence ) , the mean score for the obese sample was 30.1 ( SD = 8.1 ) . The mean for the obese women was 30.6 ( SD = 8.4 ) , and the mean score for the obese men was 26.0 ( SD = 4.4 ) . A two-tailed t test that compared these groups revealed statistically significant results , t(64) = -2.41 , p < .05 . These results suggest that the obese women had lower levels of self-confidence in social situations than the obese men . A two-tailed t test that compared mean scores of the obese sample with mean scores of the normative sample ( M = 29.8 , SD = 6.4 ) showed no statistically significant results , t(284) = .27 , p > .05 . Although the obese men showed a slight trend toward more social self-confidence than the obese women overall there were no significant differences between the obese and the nonobese groups . <p> On IDI Scale 3 ( Assertion of Autonomy ) the mean score for the total obese sample was 28.1 ( SD = 6.31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SD = 5.88 ) , and the mean for the obese men was 33.2 ( SD = 7.36 ) . The results of a two-tailed t test that compared the female and male obese subjects were statistically significant , t(64) = 2.55 , p < .01 . The obese women seemed to be less autonomous than the obese men in this study . When the obese sample was compared with the control sample ( M = 30.2 , SD = 6.1 ) , there were statistically significant differences between mean scores , t(284) = -2.40 , p < .05 . Overall , the obese subjects in this study demonstrated less assertion of their independence and autonomous functioning than those in the nonobese control group . <p> On IDI Scale 4 ( Total Dependency ) , the mean score for the obese sample was 97.3 ( SD = 14.6 ) . The mean for the obese women was 97.0 ( SD = 15.2 ) , and the mean for the obese men were 99.0 ( SD = 9.6 ) . A two-tailed t test that compared these groups showed no statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There seemed to be no differences between the obese men and women for overall dependency . When the mean score for the obese sample was compared with the mean score for the nonobese controls ( M = 99.2 , SD = 9.2 ) , there was no statistically significant difference , t(284) .... 1.04 , p > .05 . There appeared to be no differences in total dependency between the obese sample and the control sample . <p> The mean scores on the IDI and the 1 E Scale for the obese , subjects who reported a history of alcoholism in their family of origin ( N = 19 ) were compared with the scores of the obese subjects who reported no history of family alcoholism ( N = 39 ) . The subjects with a history of family alcoholism ( M = 26.1 , SD = 4.4 ) revealed results that were significantly different on Scale 3 ( Assertion of Autonomy ) from the results for the subjects with no family alcoholism , M = 29.1 , SD = 7.3 , t(56) = 2.68 , p < .05 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t(56) = .35 , p > .05 ; Scale 2 , t(56) = .10 , p > .05 ; Scale 4 , t(56) = -.51 , p > .05 ; or locus of control , t(61) = 1.34 , p > .05 . <p> Pearson product-moment correlations were computed between scores on the I-E Scale and the four scales of the IDI . Locus of control scores were not significantly correlated with any of the factor scale scores on the IDI . However , the correlation coefficients between Total Dependency and Scale 1 ( Emotional Reliance on Another Person ; r = .73 , p < .001 ) , Scale 2 ( Lack of Social Self-Confidence ; r = .76 , p < .001 ) , and Scale 3 ( Assertion of Autonomy ; r = .40 , p < .001 ) were statistically significant . These results suggest that ( a ) the greater the obese subjects ' need for emotional reliance on others , ( b ) the lower their level of self-confidence in social situations , and ( c ) the less autonomous their behavior , the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scale I were significantly correlated with scores on Scale 2 ( r = .40 , p < .001 ) . This result suggests that the greater the subjects ' need for dependent attachment and reliance on others , the more they lacked self-confidence in social environments . Discussion <p> The results of this study suggest that both female and male obese groups are more internally oriented than has been previously reported . The obese subjects in this study demonstrated an internal locus of control ; however , most of the empirical findings in the obesity literature assert that obese populations have an external control orientation . Adults who seek treatment for obesity often report feeling that they do not have control over factors that influence the development and maintenance of their obesity . The sample in this study apparently perceived that generalized control over their lives was contingent on personal actions . In other words , the obese subjects felt in control of their lives despite feeling out of control over their weight status and food-related behaviors . This finding suggests that locus of control may be more circumscribed for obese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perceived control of and efficacy in specific food- and eating-related situations . <p> The obese subjects ' motivations for seeking treatment may also reflect their internal stance . Seeking professional help for their condition may be associated with a desire to assume control of and responsibility for their lives rather than accepting their fate or " biological " destiny . Obese individuals who are internally oriented may possess certain indigenous strengths that can be used as potential predictor variables and applied toward behavior change to influence their obesity . <p> The finding that the obese subjects with no history of family obesity were significantly more internally oriented than the obese subjects with a reported history of family obesity could possibly reflect internalized views toward food , eating , and weight status , conditioned eating patterns , parental identification , role modeling , and attitudes toward diet and nutrition . <p> Contrary to prediction , there were no significant differences between the obese sample and the nonobese control sample on overall dependency attributes . Apparently both groups demonstrated similar needs for approval and dependent attachment to others . These results raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs than nonobese populations . Perhaps obese individuals modulate or fulfill various dependency needs via food and eating-related behaviors , whereas nonobese individuals find other avenues to satiate these inner yearnings and concerns . <p> The scores on the specific scales of the IDI did indicate that the obese subjects were less autonomous than the nonobese normative sample . The obese group apparently preferred to be with others rather than to be alone , and their self-esteem was contingent on approval and acceptance from others . This preference may have been due to the impact of obesity on self-esteem , the developmental capacity for individuation , thwarted levels of self-expression , and dependent rather than independent gratification . <p> The findings also suggest that the obese women were less autonomous and had lower levels of social self-confidence than the obese men . These gender differences may have been due to prevalent socialization practices that influence conditioned patterns of behavior and relatedness of men and women . In addition , the gender differences may reflect unique developmental differences in personality structure , internal needs , and dynamic conflict . <p> The obese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion of autonomy than those subjects who had no such history . Individuals who are raised in alcoholic home environments often feel abused and deprived ( whether in reality or fantasy ) . These conditions could influence a heightened need for dependent attachment and approval from others . <p> Although locus of control was not correlated with interpersonal dependency in the obese sample , total dependency was correlated with all three dependency scales independently . Therefore , the greater the need for emotional reliance on another person , the greater the overall dependency . Lower levels of social self-confidence and low assertion of independent motives were also associated with higher levels of overall interpersonal dependency . In addition , the greater the subjects ' emotional reliance on another , the less self-confidence they demonstrated in social situations . <p> The obese sample in this study showed a trend ( although not statistically significant ) toward greater vulnerability on the dependency needs and conflict items ; the nonobese control sample showed less vulnerability . This trend suggests that food- and eating-related behaviors may have an important impact on dependency states in obese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to turn to food to meet specific dependency needs . Future research that examines dependency attributes in a larger clinically obese sample may provide more cogent evidence that supports a link between obesity and greater interpersonal dependency . <p> Regarding treatment , obese patients with relatively greater overall dependency needs , higher reliance on others , lower levels of social self-confidence , and fewer capacities for autonomous behavior are probably more likely to have difficulty with obesity treatment efforts than are patients with normal dependency needs . <p> <p> 
##4001153 ABSTRACT . The influence of five dimensions of teaching ( organization , knowledge acquired , encouragement of questions , instructor 's knowledge , and presentation clarity ) on 40 undergraduate students ' judgments of teaching effectiveness was investigated . The students rated completed evaluation forms ( each with a different configuration of responses ) as to the teaching effectiveness of an instructor who might receive that given pattern of evaluation responses . The students ' subjective reports of the dimensions they believed most influential ( subjective weights ) were compared with their statistically derived judgment " policies " ( statistical weights ) . Analyses revealed that there were significant differences between the mean statistical and subjective weights on two of the five evaluation items ( knowledge acquired and presentation clarity ) . <p> STUDENT EVALUATION of instruction has been examined in recent research that has included topics such as ( a ) validity of evaluation ratings as a measure of teaching effectiveness ( e.g. , Abrami , d'Apollonia , &; Cohen , 1990 ; Baird , 1987 ; Cranton &; Smith , 1990 ; Gigliotti &; Buchtel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor or course characteristics and evaluations ( e.g. , Drews , Burroughs , &; Nokovich , 1987 ; Marlin &; Gaynor , 1989 ; Murray , Rushton , &; Paunonen , 1990 ) , and ( c ) the relationship between evaluation ratings and the instrument or process of evaluation ( e.g. , Abbott , Wulff , Nyquist , Ropp , &; Hess , 1990 ) . Few studies , however , have satisfactorily examined the underlying judgment processes used by students who are asked to assess teaching effectiveness . It is well documented that humans are not always rational and consistent in the ways they make judgments ( Kahneman , 1991 ) . Consequently , an examination of the basic judgment processes involved in student evaluation of instruction may lead to an improved understanding and interpretation of the vast amounts of past research . <p> Whitely and Doyle ( 1976 ) , in their work on implicit theories of teaching , confronted the issue of student evaluations from a judgment process perspective . Implicit theories are the assumptions that students make about covariations in various teaching behaviors . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Y are positively correlated , that student will rate an instructor high on behavior Y after having observed only behavior X. Students are thought to systematically apply their idiosyncratic theories across various evaluation situations ( Larson , 1979 ) . That is , students ' implicit theories are hypothesized to remain constant over time and to systematically influence instructor or course evaluations . Unanswered questions remain , however , regarding ( a ) whether students actually apply their implicit theories consistently and ( b ) whether students can accurately articulate their implicit theories . In a broader sense , the question becomes one of whether students have accurate insight into the factors that influence their judgments of teaching effectiveness . <p> In the present study , we examined whether student judgments of teaching effectiveness , based on the presence or absence of certain course dimensions , are consistent with postjudgment self-reported estimates of the relative influence of the dimension variations on the judgments . To investigate this issue , we applied an empirical judgment paradigm known as policy capturing ( Hammond , 1954 , 1955 ) . In this paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials ( " profiles " ) . Within each profile , levels of the various cues are manipulated ( e.g. , present or absent ) , and subjects are requested to provide a judgment ( e.g. , 1 to 5 rating ) on each of the profiles . The ratings are then regressed on the cues ( coded , for example , as 0 = cue absent and 1 = cue present ) , revealing the objective weight each subject applied to each cue while making the judgments . The statistical determination of the cue weightings for each subject is the process of capturing the subject 's judgment policy . <p> Past policy-capturing research has demonstrated that an individual 's subjective assessment of his or her own judgment policy ( i.e. , the major factors that subjects report as having contributed to their judgment ) is often at odds with the statistical ( i.e. , captured ) assessment of the same judgment . Such a phenomenon has been reported with judgments of clinical psychologists and diagnostic assessments of hyperactive children ( Ullman &; Doherty , 1984 ) , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kozloski , &; Hults , 1991 ) . The current research assessed the relationship between statistical and subjective weightings in evaluations of teaching behavior . Method <p> Subjects <p> The subjects were 40 students ( 13 male , 25 female , and 2 not indicated ) enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a large southeastern university ( median age , 19 years ) . The subjects receive . d course credit in exchange for their participation in the research . <p> Stimulus Materials <p> The stimulus materials for the study were a series of profiles , each consisting of a teaching evaluation form containing five statements : ( a ) " Each class period was well-organized. " ( b ) " The course significantly increased my knowledge or competence in the subject . " ( c ) " The instructor encouraged students to ask questions and express opinions , " ( d ) " The instructor seems knowledgeable and well-informed on the subject . " ( e ) " The instructor presented the material clearly . " Each statement had response options of yes or no . These five questions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 ) . For this study , each of the evaluation forms had been ostensibly completed ( yes or no circled for each of the five items ) by a " student " prior to the study . On each evaluation page the subjects were asked to respond to the statement " If a professor received the following course evaluation from a student ... How would you rate the quality of the professor as a teacher ? " The subjects responded on a 5-point scale ranging from very poor ( 1 ) to very good ( 5 ) . A sample profile is provided in the Appendix . <p> The stimulus materials were constructed so that all subjects provided judgments on all possible combinations of cue-level arrangements . In other words , the subjects judged all possible combinations of yes and no responses on all five evaluation form items . Given that each of the five items on the evaluation form had two response options ( yes or no ) , 32 yes no response configurations were possible . Eight duplicate profiles were developed to assess the reliability of the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and constructed into stimulus booklets with a cover page of instructions . <p> Procedure <p> The subjects participated in the study in groups of 5 to 10 . They were each given a stimulus booklet , and they worked through the 40 judgment tasks at their own pace , assessing each evaluation form individually and providing ratings on the 1 to 5 scale . The subjects were instructed not to view their previously judged profiles once they started the procedure . Their task was not to complete the course evaluation form but to evaluate 40 completed course evaluations and provide judgments of the teaching effectiveness of a professor who might receive a given pattern of responses from a student on an evaluation form . <p> When they had completed the judgment tasks , the subjects provided ( in the form of a percentage ) their own estimates of the weights given to each of the five evaluation-form items in making their judgments . Specifically , the instructions read : " You have now completed all the ratings , but we would like you to provide us with some additional information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us how much ' weight ' you gave each of the items in making your ratings . In other words , how much attention did you pay to each question on the evaluation when deciding how to rate each professor ? ( NOTE : Your total percentage should sum to 100% ) . " Thus each subject allocated percentage points according to how much each of the five items influenced the previous judgments . Results <p> Reliability Analysis <p> To calculate reliability estimates for each subject , we correlated the ratings on the eight duplicate profiles ( Presentation 1 and Presentation 2 ) . Reliability estimates ranged from 1.0 to 0.41 , with an average reliability of 0.86 ( SD = .13 ) . This analysis demonstrates that the subjects generally maintained a consistent judgment policy throughout the series of profiles . <p> Determination of Statistical Weightings <p> The yes or no responses ( coded 0 =- no and 1 = yes ) were used as predictors in multiple regression analyses of each subject 's 32 judgments ( 1 to 5 ratings ) of teaching effectiveness ( the second presentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure cue orthogonality ) . The resulting regression equation was considered the subject 's judgment policy . For each subject , squaring the beta weights associated with each evaluation item provided a measure of the proportion of the variance accounted for in that subject 's judgments by variations in the given evaluation items . <p> Assessment of Statistical and Subjective Weightings <p> To be better able to interpret a comparison of the subjects ' statistical and subjective weightings , we followed a procedure similar to that used by Ullman and Doherty ( 1984 ) and normalized the squared beta weights . The normalization procedure involved , for each subject 's data , dividing each weight by the total sum of the weights and multiplying by 100 ( thus , each subject 's statistical weights summed to 100 ) . <p> The means and standard deviations were calculated across s , 11 subjects for the statistical and subjective weightings of each evaluation item ( see Table 1 ) . Data for five of the subjects were not included in this analysis , one because of an error in the stimulus materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 100% ( a copy of all subjects ' individual statistical and subjective weightings is available from the first author ) . Five t tests for paired samples were performed to compare the statistical and subjective weight means for each evaluation item . Results revealed that the weightings did not differ significantly on Items 1 , 3 , and 4 ( see Table 1 ) . However , on Items 2 and 5 , significant differences were revealed between the statistical and subjective weight means . ( Because multiple t tests were performed , a Bonferroni correction was applied to control for experiment wise error rate . This procedure involves dividing the standard accepted level of significance .05 by the number of t tests to determine the required significance level . Thus , in the present case , a given t statistic needed to reach the .01 significance level .05/5 to be considered significant . ) Discussion <p> This study was designed to investigate the relationship between statistical and subjective weightings of judgments of teaching effectiveness . Analyses revealed no significant differences for the following evaluation items : class was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The students in our sample evidently had a reasonably accurate degree of insight into some of the factors that determined their judgments . Yet , the statistical and subjective weighting means differed significantly for the remaining two items ( course increased my knowledge and material presented clearly ) ; thus , student insight is certainly not highly accurate . The finding that the students subjectively overestimated the impact of the item material presented clearly can perhaps be understood from the perspective that lecture presentation may be one of the most salient and memorable features of a course . Thus , when our subjects reported ( subjectively ) the factors they believed influenced their ratings , they relied on the most available information in memory ( i.e. , use of the availability heuristic ) . <p> Perhaps the most interesting result of our analyses of the statistical weightings was that the item that stated " The course significantly increased my knowledge or competence in the subject " was the most influential ( highest mean ) in the assessment of teaching quality . Unfortunately , however , the subjects ( subjectively ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This finding is indeed encouraging ; Evidently these subjects did feel ( at least as expressed through their judgments ) that the amount learned in a course was a crucial variable to consider when they evaluated teaching effectiveness . The challenge is to make students realize this fact at the subjective or conscious level . <p> Limitations of the Current Research <p> Because of the artificial nature of the task in the present study , sometimes referred to as a " paper people " paradigm , we are constrained in generalizing the findings . But as Gorman , Clover , and Doherty ( 1978 ) noted , the use of a policy-capturing strategy allows for ( a ) a high degree of control and ( b ) manipulation of factors that are difficult to otherwise regulate . In addition , the paper people approach allows for the presentation of identical , standardized stimulus materials across subjects . Thus , although the policy-capturing approach lacks a degree of representativeness , it provides a great deal of control in the research environment . In fact , Ullman and Doherty ( 1984 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting should be more reliable and predictable than in the real world . <p> Future Directions <p> The current research was an initial attempt to examine the judgment processes of students who are asked to evaluate courses or instructors . Future studies should relate individual students ' performances on a policy-capturing task with evaluations of an actual course . The crucial question for researchers is whether accuracy in assessing one 's own judgments is related to accuracy or validity in the actual judgment of teaching effectiveness . Research that uses the same methodology should also be undertaken with different samples of students and different evaluation items to replicate the current findings . An interesting extension of the current research would be an assessment of faculty judgment policies of evaluation forms . A comparison of student and faculty judgment policies at the same institution might be an enlightening and informative venture . <p> TABLE 1 <p> Mean Percentages , Standard Deviations , and t-Test Results for Statistical and Subjective Weightings PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> APPENDIX <p> Sample Evaluation Profile <p> IF A PROFESSOR RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING COURSE EVALUATION FROM A STUDENT ...

##4001154 ABSTRACT . To test Herzberg 's ( 1966,1987 ; Herzberg , Mausner , &; Snyderman , 1959 ) motivator-hygiene theory , I examined the relationship between work values and job satisfaction . Educators ( N = 386 ) from 18 Canadian secondary schools were asked to report the degree to which they experienced 16 work values and five dimensions of job satisfaction . Factor analysis suggested five sets of work values : intrinsic work-related , intrinsic work-outcome , extrinsic job-related , extrinsic job-outcome , and extrinsic people-related . Regression analyses identified the best predictors for each of the five dimensions of job satisfaction . The results support and extend Herzberg 's theory . In addition to those identified by Herzberg , other factors contributed portions of variance to the five dimensions of job satisfaction . <p> WORK VALUES denote the degree of worth , importance , and desirability of what happens at work ( Knoop , 1991 ) ; job satisfaction indicates an individual 's general attitude toward the job ( Brooke , Russell , &; Price , 1988 ) . Valuation is a qualitative act , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Satisfaction refers more to gratification of needs and wants . An individual 's judgment of what takes place at work would be expected to influence his or her satisfaction with the job . <p> The seemingly different yet theoretically connected conceptions of work values and job satisfaction are reflected in process and content theories of job satisfaction ( Locke , 1976 ) . Process theories are attempts to specify values considered causally relevant to job satisfaction . Content theories are focused on identifying values conducive to , but not necessarily causal to , job satisfaction . <p> Herzberg ( 1966,1987 ; Herzberg et al . 1959 ) , in his well-known , much criticized , yet still very relevant motivator-hygiene theory , proposed several characteristics consistently related to job satisfaction and dissatisfaction . Intrinsic factors -- achievement , recognition , work itself , and responsibility -- were recurrently mentioned by respondents as sources of satisfaction . Extrinsic factors -- company policy , supervision , salary , relationship with peers , status , and security -- were frequently named as causes of job dissatisfaction . Herzberg concluded that job satisfaction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote growth needs ; dissatisfaction depends on hygiene factors that serve lower-order needs . <p> Herzberg 's theory has been criticized for purporting to explain job satisfaction , rather than work motivation , without really measuring job satisfaction ( Caston &; Braito , 1985 ) . The present research tests Herzberg 's theory by measuring work values and job satisfaction separately and examining them concurrently . Two questions were asked : ( a ) How separate are work values and job satisfaction ? ( b ) Which set of values best predicts different aspects of job satisfaction ? Method <p> Subjects <p> The subjects were 386 volunteers from secondary schools : teachers ( N = 245 ) , department heads ( N = 100 ) , and principals ( N = 41 ) from five school boards in a large metropolitan area of Canada . Most of the subjects were married ( 278 ; 72% ) and held a bachelor 's degree ( 264 ; 68% ) . More than half were women ( 197 ; 51% ) . The average age was 43 years ; the average tenure was 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatfield , Robinson , and Huseman 's ( 198 ' 5 ) Job Perception-Scale . The 20-item measure , modeled after Smith , Kendall , and Hulin 's ( 1969 ) Job Descriptive Index , was used to assess five facets of job satisfaction : work itself , pay , opportunities for promotion , supervision , and coworkers . The 16 work values were derived from Elizur 's ( 1984 ) research . The respondents were asked to what degree they currently experienced each of these values in their job . A 5-point scale was used to measure both sets of responses . <p> The questionnaires were distributed by part-time graduate students to principals , department heads , and teachers in 18 schools . Most of the administrators ( 92% ) , a majority of the department heads ( 64% ) , and nearly half the teachers ( 46% ) who received questionnaires completed them . Results <p> Factor Analyses <p> To examine whether the reported job satisfaction dimensions were distinct from the work values , I performed two factor analyses . In the first method , which Cranton and Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as units of analysis . In the second method , called idiosyncratic , I used deviations from the means as the unit of analysis . The first method relies on overall averages , whereas the second method takes into account individual differences in the scores . Both methods led to similar factor structures but explained different amounts of variance . In each case , the 21 variables emerged into five fairly distinct factors . However , the variance for the normative method was 34% , whereas the variance for the idiosyncratic method was 59% . <p> Two factors contained intrinsic values toward work ( see Table 1 ) . The first factor included seven work values and one satisfaction dimension : exercising responsibility , achievement through work , influence over one 's work , doing meaningful work , being able to use one 's abilities and knowledge , independence in doing one 's work , contributing to society , and job satisfaction with the work itself . This factor is called Intrinsic Work-Related Values because the variables seem to stem from the content and worth of the work itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job status , recognition , influence in the organization , and pride in working in the organization . These values together are called Intrinsic Work-Outcome Values because they seem to be manifestations resulting from work . <p> Two other reported factors consisted of extrinsic values directed toward the job , not the work . The third factor contained two values and one job satisfaction dimension : benefits , job security , and satisfaction with pay . This factor was therefore called Extrinsic Job-Outcome Values . The fourth factor was made up of only two values : hours of work and working conditions . It was called Extrinsic Job-Related Values . <p> The fifth factor consisted solely of three dimensions of satisfaction : opportunities for promotion , supervision , and co-workers . The other two dimensions , satisfaction with work ( Factor 1 ) and pay ( Factor 3 ) , loaded partially on this factor ( .44 and . 17 , respectively ) . The fifth factor thus represents aspects of job satisfaction , because it does not contain any of Elizur 's values . This factor was called Extrinsic People-Related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element is present in this factor and absent in the other factors . <p> Correlation Analyses <p> To discover which values best predicted each of the five dimensions of job satisfaction , I performed simple correlation and regression analyses . Pearson correlations indicated that each of the five dimensions of job satisfaction was statistically , but not always meaningfully , correlated with most of the work values . For satisfaction with the work itself , correlations ranged from .54 for achievement to . 12 for benefits or security . For satisfaction with pay , correlations ranged from .36 for status and benefits to .06 for pride in the organization . For satisfaction with opportunities for promotion , correlations ranged from .38 for recognition and .34 for influence over work and the organization to .07 for security . For satisfaction with supervision , correlations ranged from .31 for pride in the organization and .31 for esteem or achievement to .07 for security . Last , for satisfaction with co-workers , correlations ranged from .27 for influence in the organization to .03 for benefits . Overall , of the 80 relationships , 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regression analyses identified the best predictors of the five dimensions of job satisfaction . For satisfaction with work , four predictors entered the regression equation at a significant level ( p = .05 ) : achievement ( R 2 = .30 ) , use of abilities ( R 2 = .07 ) , pride in the organization ( R 2 = .02 ) , and meaningfulness of work ( R 2 = .02 ) . The total variance explained by the four predictors was .41 . <p> For satisfaction with pay , five work values were identified as significant predictors : job status ( R 2 = .12 ) , benefits ( R 2 = .07 ) , influence over work ( R 2 = .02 ) , pride in the organization ( R 2 = .02 ) , and working conditions ( R 2 = .01 ) . These five predictors explained 24% of the variance in the dependent variable . <p> Only three predictors were found for reported satisfaction with opportunities for promotion : recognition ( R 2 = .14 ) , influence over work ( R 2 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 = .0l ) . Altogether , these three variables explained 18% of the variance in satisfaction with promotions . <p> As one would have expected from the factor structure , the other two job satisfaction dimensions did not produce many or meaningful predictors . For satisfaction with supervision , pride in the organization ( R 2 = .10 ) and esteem ( R 2 = .04 ) explained a total of 14% of the variance . For satisfaction with co-workers , status ( R 2 = .07 ) , independence in work ( R 2 = .02 ) , and pride in the organization ( R 2 = .02 ) explained 11% of the variance . Discussion <p> The factor structure indicates that for this sample of educators three of the five reported dimensions of job satisfaction ( promotions , supervision , and co-workers ) differed from work values and constituted a separate factor . The common element of these dimensions seemed to relate to people . The fourth dimension ( satisfaction with the work itself ) related to intrinsic work values , and the fifth dimension ( pay ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job satisfaction dimensions were clearly reported to be separate from work values . <p> The factor called Intrinsic Work-Outcome Values points to the possibility that there is a second dimension of work that differs from Intrinsic Work-Related Values aspects . This finding seems logical because it contains the assumption that work can affect an individual directly through a set of first-level values or indirectly through a set of second-level values . The first-level values seem to have an introverted , subjective component , whereas the second-level values have more of an extraverted and objective nature . <p> Satisfaction with pay fits in well with other extrinsic job outcomes . The second extrinsic factor ( Extrinsic Job-Related Values ) , consisting of working conditions and hours of work , seems to measure an extrinsic dimension of satisfaction distinct from Extrinsic Job-Outcome Values . In short , the factor structure suggests five dimensions of job satisfaction that are somewhat different from those traditionally proposed : satisfaction with ( a ) the work itself , ( b ) work outcomes , ( c ) the job itself , ( d ) job outcomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The regression analyses showed somewhat divergent results from the factor analysis . The first two factors contributed to the variance of nearly all job satisfaction dimensions . The intrinsic work-related values of achievement , influence over work , meaningfulness of work , abilities and knowledge , and independence contributed to the variance of satisfaction with work , pay , promotion , and co-workers . Similarly , the intrinsic work-outcome values of esteem , job status , recognition , and pride also contributed to all five job satisfaction dimensions . Pride in the organization explained some of the variance in all five dimensions . Two extrinsic values -- benefits and working conditions-explained some of the variance in satisfaction with pay . Thus , intrinsic values contributed to all five dimensions of job satisfaction , but extrinsic values contributed to only one dimension . <p> The results support and extend Herzberg 's theory . Not only did the variables Herzberg termed satisfiers -- achievement , recognition , the work itself , and responsibility -- load clearly on the intrinsic dimension of job satisfaction , but the results also suggest other values that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over work , being able to use one 's abilities and knowledge , having independence in doing one 's work , contributing to society , receiving esteem from others , gaining job status , and having influence and pride in the organization . In a later paper , Herzberg ( 1966 ) attested to the existence of other psychological needs that can motivate individuals to act . <p> The regression analyses supported the hypothesis that other values also influence job satisfaction . Although Herzberg 's sense of achievement accounted for the greatest amount of variance in satisfaction with the work itself , three other factors not identified by Herzberg added another 11% to the variance . All of the predictors for this dimension were intrinsic values . Indeed , as one would have expected for this dimension , most of the predictors were intrinsic work-related values . One might wonder which aspect of job satisfaction is tapped by the values of the second factor ( Intrinsic Work-Outcome Values ) . Adding and measuring such a factor would be logical because satisfaction with the work leaves out satisfying feelings arising from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's theory . Convenient hours of work , which would include flextime , partially reflect Herzberg 's company policy and work conditions . This two-item factor ( Extrinsic Job-Related Values ) explained only 5% of the overall variance . The other extrinsic factor , Extrinsic Job-Outcome Values , also supports Herzberg 's hygiene factors . Thus the present research suggests that two extrinsic forces may contribute to job satisfaction or , as Herzberg phrased it , to an absence of dissatisfaction . Both forces relate to factors that motivate action to avoid discomfort . <p> The fifth factor ( Extrinsic People-Related Values ) contained three job satisfaction dimensions . Herzberg classified all of them , concerning co-workers , supervisors , and promotions , as hygiene factors . He would have claimed that these three variables can , at best , lead to an absence of dissatisfaction , but not to satisfaction . He would have argued further that these three variables can therefore not be considered job satisfaction dimensions , or they can be so considered only to a limited extent . <p> The only variable that did not fully support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene factor in his framework , it emerged as an intrinsic work-outcome value in this study . In the regression analysis , status was the main predictor of satisfaction with pay . Possibly this sample of educators , practicing in a relatively affluent geographical area , linked status to pay and to social position . <p> Except for satisfaction with work , the variance explained for the other four reported dimensions of job satisfaction was relatively small ; thus , other predictors of job satisfaction were not examined here . Because most of Herzberg 's factors were included in this research , it is apparent that his factors explain only a small percentage of each of the dimensions of job satisfaction . If the causal model of job satisfaction is accurate and values do combine to determine aspects of job satisfaction , then the results suggest that there may be two work dimensions , two job dimensions , and one people dimension . <p> TABLE 1 <p> Factor Loadings , Means , and Standard Deviations for Variables PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> <p> 
##4001166 ABSTRACT . Unionization votes of 133 members of an employee association at a large , midwestern , American university were examined . General beliefs , specific beliefs , normative pressures ( co-workers , family , and close friends ) , and dissatisfaction with the employee association influenced votes for unionization . Job satisfaction , age , race , and gender did not influence votes for unionization . <p> What are the attitudes of members of employee associations toward unionization ? Do some employee associations become unions ? A nationally representative survey of employees , conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in 1984 for the AFL-CIO Committee on the Evolution of Work ( 1985 ) , presented some interesting findings on the attitudes of nonunion workers in the United States . Although 56% of nonunion workers indicated that they would join an association , only 37% indicated that they would vote for union representation if an election were held at their workplace ( Ichniowski &; Zax , 1990 ) . <p> Prior research has suggested that some associations can become unions , and the AFL-CIO Committee on the Evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there is debate about associations and their linkage to unions . Some academics and union officials believe that associations can be substitutes for unions ; others see associations as complementary and as stepping stones to unions . <p> Although most private-sector association members are retirees and workers on lay-off , associations in the public sector are workplace specific , and the memberships consist of current employees ( Ichniowski &; Zax , 1990 ) . Since the 1970s , several employee associations in the public sector have merged with national labor unions , such as the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) and the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ; Cornfield , 1991 ) . In fact , in an analysis of census data on local government departments , Ichniowski and Zax ( 1990 ) found that the presence of an association in 1977 was a strong predictor of the formation of a union by 1982 . <p> Most of the research on employee associations has focused on association-union mergers ( Cornfield , 1991 ) . One area that has received special attention has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mergers , traits of merger partners , and barriers to mergers ) . However , only one published study has addressed the opinions of state employee association members toward merger with a union . In that study , Cornfield ( 1991 ) examined the impact of employees ' socioeconomic status and opportunity for upward mobility on their approval for merger with a labor union . Cornfield found a significant effect for both factors . But it is surprising that , although considerable research has been done to examine factors that influence union voting intent among nonunion employees , virtually no research has been undertaken to investigate the factors that influence an employee association member to vote for unionization . <p> Several causes of votes for unionization have been identified , and beliefs about unions and job satisfaction have been singled out as the more prominent ones ( Barling , Fullagar , &; Kelloway , 1992 ) . Although much has been written about the effect of union beliefs on unionization , there has been a wide diversity in the measures used to capture the effects of beliefs about unions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 ) . Some researchers have used belief measures that simply refer to " unions " ( Kochan , 1979 ) ; others have referred to the effect of a union at the respondents ' workplace ( Youngblood , Denisi , Molleston , &; Mobley , 1984 ) . In previous studies , researchers have used either specific or general beliefs about unions as predictors of voting intentions ; however , Premack and Hunter ( 1988 ) , in a meta-analysis , treated both measures as the same . More recently ; in a meta-analysis of some determinants of union voting intent , Deshpande ( 1992 ) showed that the two constructs are distinct . <p> Recently , the effect of normative pressures on union voting intentions has been investigated . As Montgomery ( 1989 , p. 263 ) correctly noted , " The voting choice can not be adequately understood . . . without taking into account the influence that others have on the voter . " Youngblood et al . ( 1984 ) , in a sample of members of a consumer panel , found that a respondent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a significant effect on the respondent 's union voting intent . Zalesny ( 1985 ) found that university faculty were more likely to vote for unions when social forces were favoring unions . More recently , Montgomery ( 1989 ) , in a study of clerical employees of a public university , found that opinions of close friends , family members , and co-workers did influence respondents ' voting intentions , even though most of the respondents denied such an influence . <p> In the present study , demographic controls included measures for age , race , and gender . Additional control variables included a measure of ( a ) overall job satisfaction and ( b ) satisfaction with the existing employee association . The implications of age are mixed ( Chacko &; Greer , 1982 ) . Some researchers have found support for the proposition that younger workers are more militant , whereas others have found support for the proposition that younger workers prefer not to work under a rigid seniority system , typically found in unionized settings . There has consistently been a positive relationship between being non-White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , most likely because union racial equality policies and protective policies inhibit possible employer discrimination . Hypotheses about gender effects have been generally similar to those about race , but studies with voting intent as the dependent variable have generally come to the conclusion that there is no gender effect ( Deshpande &; Fiorito , 1989 ) . <p> Satisfaction with the job has been shown in many studies to have a negative relationship with the desire for unionization ( Freeman &; Medoff , 1984 ) . Thus , I hypothesized that job satisfaction among association members would decrease pro-union voting intent . Finally , an overall measure of satisfaction with the employee association was used . I proposed that employees satisfied with their association would vote for unionization . This hypothesis is consistent with the findings of researchers who believe that employees are more likely to reject unionization if they are dissatisfied with the performance of their association ( Ichniowski &; Zax , 1990 ) . Examination of the impact of such factors as specific beliefs , general beliefs , and normative pressures as determinants of unionization votes among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Participants <p> A survey of 330 members of an employee association of administrative and professional employees at a large , midwestern ( U.S. ) university was completed in 1992 . The faculty ( American Association of University Professors ) , hourly workers ( American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees ) , and the police at this university were already unionized . The goal of this survey was to collect information on attitudes of employee association members toward unions . The survey also included a wide range of individual and workplace-related variables . <p> The survey was conducted shortly after the members of the association participated in a secret ballot that would allow the association to petition for different unions and an election conducted by the state 's Employment Relations Commission . One month before the secret ballot , the association members met with representatives of three unions ( United Auto Workers , American Association of University Professors , and the Michigan Education Association ) . Concurrently , the university had released a four-page statement that answered many questions about what would happen if the association unionized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed the association members on some of the negative consequences of unionization . <p> A total of 243 employee association members responded to my survey . Of these , 63 association members were dropped from the study because they did not participate in the secret ballot . In addition , responses of 47 association members were not used because they did not respond to all items in the study . Thus , 133 respondents remained for the analysis . Measures <p> Self-reported voter behavior on the secret ballot was the dependent variable . The behavior was measured on a 2-point scale ( 1 =favor unionization , 0 = reject unionization ) . <p> On a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from agree strongly ( 4 ) to disagree strongly ( 1 ) , the respondents were asked to react to 10 general statements about unions : ( a ) unions improve wages , ( b ) unions improve job security , ( c ) unions improve recognition you receive for the work you do , ( d ) unions improve fringe benefits ( e.g. , medical benefits , leave ) , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions improve participation in decisions that affect your job , ( g ) unions improve health and safety , ( h ) unions improve treatment by supervisors , ( i ) unions reduce discrimination against women by employer , and ( j ) unions reduce discrimination based on race or national origin . <p> On a 3-point Likert-type scale ranging from get better ( 3 ) to get worse ( 1 ) , the respondents were asked to react to the impact of unionization at the workplace on the following 10 items : ( a ) the pay you receive , ( b ) your job security , ( c ) the recognition you receive for the work you do , ( d ) your fringe benefits ( e.g. , medical benefits , leave ) , ( e ) your chances of job advancement , ( f ) your opportunity to participate in decisions that affect your job , ( g ) health and safety problems , ( h ) treatment by supervisors , ( i ) discrimination against women by employers , and ( j ) discrimination based on race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union effects at respondents ' current jobs , and the general beliefs measures refer to generalizations . The specific beliefs measures of this study are consistent with those used by Deshpande and Fiorito ( 1989 ) . <p> The respondents were asked to indicate the perceptions of co-workers , relatives , and close friends about unions . These perceptions were measured by three items on a 3-point Likert-type scale ranging from yes ( 1 ) , to uncertain ( 2 ) , to no ( 3 ) : ( a ) Do you think your co-workers would favor a union ( reverse coded ) ? ( b ) Do you think your relatives would oppose your joining a union ? ( c ) Do you think your close friends would oppose your joining a union ? <p> A 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from very satisfied ( 4 ) to not at all satisfied ( 1 ) was used to measure overall job satisfaction , and a similar 4-point Liken-type scale was used to measure satisfaction with the association . For demographic variables , the respondents were asked to indicate their age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices was used to measure race . The responses were later compressed into Whites ( 1 ) and non-Whites ( 2 ) . The respondents were also requested to report their sex ( 1= male , 0 = female ) . <p> I conducted a regression analysis to examine the significance of the variables . Because the dependent variable was dichotomous , I used a probit procedure instead of the more conventional ordinary least squares regression procedure . Results <p> The correlation results show that votes for unionization were affected by general beliefs , specific beliefs , normative pressures , job satisfaction , and association satisfaction ( see Table 1 ) . But it would be premature to draw conclusions from these results , because there were intercorrelations among the predictors . <p> Results of the probit procedure show that general beliefs , specific beliefs , normative pressures , and satisfaction with association had a significant influence on votes for unionization ( see Table 2 ) . Age , sex , race , and job satisfaction did not significantly affect unionization votes . Discussion and Implications <p> The results of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions play an important role in votes for unionization , the impact of a union at the workplace ( specific beliefs ) may be a more significant determinant of votes for unionization . This finding provides support for Gagala 's ( 1983 ) contention that union organizers need to put more emphasis on the employee 's own workplace than on general contributions of unions to society and to the work force . This can be done by providing potential members with information on labor contracts at comparable workplaces and on the significant impacts that have been made . Union organizers should also emphasize policies , practices , and unique characteristics of their union when trying to organize employees . <p> Unionization votes among association members are also influenced by the perceptions of co-workers , close friends , and family members . In fact , during an election campaign , consultants often advise employers to address their letters to the employees and their spouses ( Gagala , 1983 ) . A spouse is typically interested in activities concerning work ( especially union activity ) and can influence the employee 's final decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Job satisfaction did not influence unionization decisions of association members . It is possible that job dissatisfaction was a reason to join the association but not a factor in the transition from an association to a union . This theory is consistent with findings of previous research , which suggest that unions may not be the only means chosen by employees to redress dissatisfaction ( DeCotiis &; LeLouarn , 1981 ) . Thus , labor educators and researchers should examine the factors that influence the decision to join an association as opposed to joining a union . <p> There was a lack of support for the proposition that association satisfaction will have a positive impact on employees ' unionization votes . One could argue that dissatisfaction with association membership ( perhaps related to the association 's ability to influence overall employment conditions for the occupation or for an employer ) could lead to the choice of a representative that is , potentially , more militant . Anonymous notes sent by respondents with their completed surveys supported this contention . A major concern of the employees was that the association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any undesirable actions of the university , nor could it influence the university 's compensation policies . These comments imply that the desire for unionization could be driven by factors beyond the jurisdiction of an employee association . <p> The results of this study show the value of using micro-data rather than union organization-level data to address the association-to-union transition . Associations in the public sector are workplace specific , with current employees as members ; associations in the private . sector may not be workplace specific or may not even include working members . Thus , associations in the private sector are quite unlikely to be called on to be bargaining agents ( Ichniowski &; Zax , 1990 ) . Moreover , the sample in this study consisted of employee association members at a single , public university . The work environment of a public university is different from the work environment at a private-sector organization and from other public-sector organizations . Despite these limitations , this study has some important implications for labor educators , researchers , and union organizers . TABLE 1 Means , Standard Deviations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Note .

##4001167 ABSTRACT . Conservatism is often assumed to imply a continuity of values and positions between past and present . Previous research has demonstrated , however , that there are discontinuities between historical and contemporary political conservatism and thai modern political conservatives endorse programs and legislation once regarded as liberal . Testing whether the same pattern may hold for religious conservatism was the purpose of this research . Perceptions of conservative positions in Christian history were assessed among young adults ( N = 221 ) . Results showed that individuals who identified themselves as conservatives were less likely to recognize past conservative positions on religious issues than individuals who identified themselves as liberals . These findings were not accounted for by lack of knowledge about religious history on the part of conservatives . Furthermore , women were more likely than men to accurately identify conservative and liberal positions of the past . The findings suggest that religious conservatism , like political conservatism , does not necessarily involve a continuity of positions between past and present . <p> Conservatism is often assumed to imply a continuity of values and positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining traditions and institutions ( Minogue , 1967 ) . Previous research on political conservatism , however , has demonstrated important discontinuities between historical and contemporary conservatism . For example , in a study of college-educated young adults , Sugar , Viney , and Rote ( 1992 ) found that individuals who were politically conservative in terms of contemporary issues ( e.g. , national health insurance ) supported historically liberal programs and legislation ( e.g. , child labor laws ) . <p> To date , no research has explored possible continuities and discontinuities between historical and contemporary religious conservatism . For example , do modem religious conservatives support historically liberal positions , such as vaccination to avert disease ? 1 An exploration of the perceived roots of modern religious conservatism seems timely in light of the current national debate on " traditional " values in education and social policy . A study of the relationship between historical and contemporary conservative religious views may also contribute to our understanding of some of the philosophical and psychological characteristics of conservative thought . <p> Another important question is whether perceptions of historical religious conservatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not even report the gender composition of their sample ( e.g. , Kellstedt &; Smidt , 1991 ; Tamney , Johnson , &; Burton , 1992 ) . There is indirect evidence , however , that gender may play a role in views of religious positions . For example , a study of young adults found that women and liberals were less likely to justify male dominance than men and conservatives ( Lottes &; Kuriloff , 1992 ) . In another study , the relationship between fundamentalism and discriminatory attitudes toward Blacks , women , homosexual persons , and communists varied according to gender ( McFarland , 1989 ; but see Kirkpatrick , 1993 , for opposite findings ) . Because religious positions about women have evolved to a greater degree than positions about men , it is likely that women will be more accurate than men at recognizing conservative programs of the past . <p> This study is an adaptation and extension of a study of political conservatism by Sugar et al . ( 1992 ) . In recognition of the variability of beliefs and values across religions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary Christian views , as perceived by Christian respondents . Based on the findings of Sugar et al. , we hypothesized that modem Christian conservatives would be less likely than modern Christian liberals to recognize conservative positions of the past . We anticipated that conservatives ' less accurate recognition of past religious positions , compared with liberals , might be a function of their limited awareness of historical religious events . Our second hypothesis was that women , especially women who identified themselves as liberal , would be more likely than men to accurately recognize religious positions of the past . Method Participants <p> Two hundred twenty-one undergraduate students ( 141 women and 80 men ) enrolled in introductory psychology classes participated in the study as one of several ways to fulfill a research requirement . Because the study was limited to exploring Christian views , we included only respondents who identified themselves as having a Christian background . In terms of religious orientation , participants identified themselves as Protestant ( n = 103 ) , Catholic ( n = 72 ) , nondenominational Christian ( n = 20 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ( n = 8 ) . The " other " category included individuals who identified themselves as having no current Christian affiliation but whose parents were either Catholic or Protestant . Ages of participants ranged from 17 to 36 with a mean age of 18 years ( SD = 1.6 ) . The sample was composed of 155 first-year students , 41 sophomores , 19 juniors , and 6 seniors ; of these students , 187 were European Americans , 14 were Latinas/os , 8 were Asian Americans , 4 were African Americans , 3 were Native Americans , and 5 did not specify ethnicity . All participants signed a consent form and were treated in accordance with the " ethical principles of psychologists " ( American Psychological Association , 1992 ) . Materials <p> The Christian Religious History Quiz ( henceforth referred to as the CRH-Quiz ) was designed to measure participants ' knowledge of Christian religious history ( see Table 1 ) . Based on a review of literature on the history of Christianity ( Reid , Linder , Shelley , &; Stout , 1990 ) , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian ( true for both Catholics and Protestants ) statements . Three historically inaccurate statements were also included ( one presumably Catholic , one presumably Protestant , and one general Christian ) . <p> The final CRH-Q consisted of 19 statements ( 5 Protestant , 6 Catholic , and 8 general ) describing issues or ideological positions supported or opposed by Catholic and/or Protestant conservatives . These statements covered topics such as the separation between science and religion ( Items 3 , 8 , 15 ) , the status of women ( Items 1 , 5 , 6 ) , the regulation of sexual behavior ( Items 2 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 18 ) , the separation of church and state ( Items 10 , 11 , 14 , 17 ) , and the literal interpretation of the Bible ( Item 13 ) . Participants were asked to indicate whether the statements were historically true or false . A respondent 's CRH-Quiz score was obtained by averaging incorrect responses across the 19 items . Each incorrect response received a score of 1 . Averaged CRH-Quiz scores ranged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification and lower scores indicating more accurate identification . <p> In addition to the CRH-Quiz , two scales were developed consistent with the method used by Sugar et al . ( 1992 ) . The first , entitled the Christian Religious Orientation Scale ( henceforth referred to as the CROS ) , was designed to assess whether respondents were conservative , moderate , or liberal in their current religious orientation ( see Table 2 ) . The second , Perception of Historical Christian Conservatism Scale ( henceforth referred to as the PHCCS ) , was designed to measure perceptions of conservative positions in Christian history ( see Table 3 ) . <p> The Christian Religious Orientation Scale ( CROS ) consisted of 19 statements describing positions that are endorsed by most Christian orthodoxies in the United States ( e.g. , creationism , sexual abstinence before marriage , male ministry , and the authority and infallibility of the Bible ; Reid et al. , 1990 ) . Several items were adapted from Fullerton and Hunsberger 's ( 1982 ) Unidimensional Scale of Christian Orthodoxy . The remaining items were based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , Zodhiates , 1990 ) . Respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their agreement with these positions on a 7-point scale . Eleven of the scale items were worded so that a strongly agree response reflected a conservative religious orientation ( e.g. , " The Bible in every detail is the literal word of God " ) ; for the rest of the items a strongly agree response reflected a liberal religious orientation ( e.g. , " The professional ministry or priesthood should be open to women " ) . These latter items were scored on a 7-point scale with a strongly agree response receiving a score of 7 and a strongly disagree response receiving a score of 1 . The former items were reverse scored . <p> The final CROS score was computed for each participant by averaging across the 19 items . In addition , participants were asked to give a personal definition of religious conservatism and liberalism . These definitions were used to confirm knowledge of the meaning of conservatism and liberalism . Participants were also asked to rate on a 7-point scale how religiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the religious self-rating item ) . <p> The Perception of Historical Christian Conservatism Scale ( PHCCS ) consisted of the same items as the CRH-Quiz with different instructions . Instead of judging whether a statement was true or false , participants were asked to assume that the statements were historically accurate and to judge whether each item was more likely to represent the position of a conservative or a liberal . Eight items reflected the position of a conservative . For example , one PHCCS conservative item stated that " Until 1961 , it was illegal in most states east of the Mississippi River to keep a business open on Sunday . Sunday was considered the appointed day of rest and worship . " Respondents were asked to indicate on a scale from 1 to 7 whether those who were opposed to opening a place of business on Sunday were more likely to be religiously liberal or conservative . A score of 1 indicated that the respondent judged a given position to be conservative and a score of 7 indicated that a respondent judged a given position to be liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals and were reverse scored . For example , one item stated that " In the 18th century , the vaccine preventing smallpox was introduced . Some Christians denounced the practice of inoculation as interfering in God 's work . " 2 Respondents were asked to assume that the statement was historically accurate and to indicate on a 7-point scale whether those who were favorable to vaccination were more likely to be liberal or conservative . Respondents who answered liberal ( 7 ) received a score of 1 . <p> The three historically inaccurate items were included in the scale to disguise the purpose of the scale , but were not entered in the final score . The final PHCCS score was computed for each participant by averaging across the 16 historically accurate items . The final scores could range from I ( accurate judgment ) to 7 ( inaccurate judgment ) . Higher scores indicated more errors in the identification of the stance of conservatives on religious historical events . Procedure <p> Because some CROS items share themes with PHCCS items , we thought it possible that previous experience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the order of presentation of these two scales was balanced . Half of the participants completed the three scales in the following order : CROS , CRH-Quiz , followed by the PHCCS . The other half completed the scales in the following order : CRH-Quiz , PHCCS , followed by the CROS . Upon completion of the three scales , participants were asked to provide information regarding their current religious affiliation , personal religious background , frequency of attendance at religious services , and their parents ' religious backgrounds . Participants were then debriefed on the goals of the study . Results <p> An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests . No order effects were found for the CROS and PHCCS ; data were therefore collapsed across order of presentation . Internal consistency of the CROS scale was verified by Cronbach 's alpha ( .90 ) . The CROS score was found to be significantly correlated with the religious self-rating item , r ( 220 ) = .65 , p < .01 . Accordingly , the mean CROS score and the self-rating item were averaged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The TRO score could range from 1 to 7 ; the observed range was from 1.2 to 6.9 , with higher scores indicating a liberal orientation and lower scores indicating a conservative orientation . Consistent with the method used by Sugar et al . ( 1992 ) , participants were categorized as conservative if their mean TRO score was between 1.0 and 3.95 ( n = 69 ) , moderate if their mean score was between 3.96 and 4.95 ( n = 67 ) , and liberal if their mean score was between 4.96 and 7.0 ( n = 85 ) . The internal consistency of the PHCCS was confirmed by Cronbach 's alpha ( .78 ) . The overall mean score for the PHCCS was 2.6 ( SD = .77 ) ; the range was 1.1 to 6.3 . Higher scores indicate more errors in the identification of the stance of conservatives on religious historical events . <p> To assess whether knowledge of Christian history varied depending on current religious orientation , CRH-Quiz scores of participants classified as conservative , moderate , or liberal were compared . Based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRH-Quiz for conservatives was .29 , for moderates .29 , and for liberals .28 . A one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) indicated no statistically significant difference in knowledge of Christian history across the three groups . <p> Finally , PHCCS scores were analyzed in a 2 x 3 ( Gender x Religious Orientation ) analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to test the hypotheses that modern conservatives would be less likely to recognize past conservative positions than liberals , and that women would be more likely than men to identify historically conservative positions . A statistically significant effect for religious orientation was found , F(2,215) = 7.10 , p = .001 , indicating a difference between the three groups with respect to errors in identifying past conservative positions ( see Figure 1 ) . Religious orientation accounted for 6% of the variance in PHCCS scores ( etasup 2 = .06 ) . A priori comparisons using a Bonferroni adjustment ( p < .03 ) indicated that liberals ( M = 2.37 , SD = .65 ) were more accurate than conservatives ( M = 2.78 , SD = .75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .85 ) . Conservatives and moderates did not differ from each other in terms of recognition errors . With an alpha level of .05 , a statistically significant main effect for gender was also found , F(1,215) = 5.82 , p = .017 , indicating that the women identified conservative positions of the past more accurately than the men ( Ms = 2.52 and 2.78 , respectively ) . Gender accounted for 2% of the variance in PHCCS scores ( etasup 2 = .02 ) . There was no statistically significant interaction between gender and religious orientation . Discussion <p> The present data on religious conservatism are consistent with previous findings on political conservatism ( Sugar et al. , 1992 ) . We found evidence of important discontinuities between contemporary and historical conservatism . More specifically , the present data point to a failure of contemporary religious conservatives and moderates to identify religious conservative positions of the past , compared with liberals . These findings were not accounted for by differences across modern religious orientation groups in knowledge about the occurrence of these religious events . In other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware that certain positions ( e.g. , the perception that women who are menstruating are unclean , PHCCS Item 9 ) were endorsed , but were nonetheless less likely than the liberals to recognize these as conservative positions ( Ms for Item 9 were 2.41 for conservatives , 2.16 for moderates , and 1.4 for liberals ) , F(2,218) = 21.51 , p = .00001 . Although religious orientation accounted for only 6% of the variance in PHCCS , we believe that our findings are compelling because they were obtained under the most inauspicious of circumstances ( i.e. , with a sample of a college-educated individuals who were well informed about the historical occurrence of the religious events chosen for this study ) . As noted by Prentice and Miller ( 1992 ) , small effects can be impressive if they emerge in unlikely situations . <p> The failure on the part of the conservatives and moderates to recognize past conservative religious programs may involve both political and psychological processes . As we noted earlier , conservatives , by definition , aim at preserving the old order . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , change is constantly creeping in . For conservatives , what is to be conserved may be constantly shifting ( Minogue , 1967 ) . When liberal advocates for change prevail , the proposed change ( e.g. , in the religious domain , marriage for priests ; in the political domain , an entitlement program , such as Social Security ) may be incorporated in a new social structure . Such a structure may result in changes in the community 's belief system and may become a candidate for conservation . The position of early conservatives who opposed the change may no longer be relevant to the contemporary conservative agenda . <p> This theory can be applied to critique the evolution of liberal thought as well . It is likely that modem liberals would fail to identify past failed liberal programs if such programs had become inconsistent with modem liberal beliefs and values . The difference is that , in a dynamic society , liberals are more likely to embrace novelty than conservatives , although conservatives may try to instigate changes that bring back past structures . Thus , psychologically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves in the position of wanting to abandon and even forget past agendas . <p> The second main finding of this study was that women were significantly more likely than men to identify conservative positions of the past , as we predicted . Again , this finding is statistically significant ( p < .05 ) , although the amount of variance accounted for by gender is small ( 2% ) . In accordance with the arguments set forth earlier , it makes sense that women would have a more accurate recollection of historically conservative positions . Many of the changes in Christian religious doctrine initiated by liberals involved an expansion in the role of women . Some liberal positions ( e.g. , the rejection of the menstruation taboos ) have been completely assimilated by mainstream Christianity . As a result , women may be more motivated to remember past religious positions because many of these positions had far-reaching consequences for the quality of their lives . It is of interest that , in each group ( conservatives , moderates , and liberals ) , women made fewer errors in identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 1 ) . <p> Yet , it is somewhat surprising that a gender effect would be found among well-educated respondents from a large secular university with an established Women 's Studies program . One would think that these college men would be as likely as the women to have been exposed to information about conservative positions in religious history . It is possible , however , that these men processed the information differently than the women . For men , information about past conservative positions may have conflicted with well-established beliefs and strong positive feelings about Christianity . The historical data might have been unconsciously miscoded to preserve the familiar beliefs and feelings , as suggested by a theory of conceptual conservatism recently proposed by Nissani ( 1994 ) . " The most difficult mental act , " writes Nissani , " is to rearrange a familiar bundle of data , to look at it differently " ( p. 310 ) . <p> Although small effects are typical in religion research , future research on religious conservatism should experiment with different operationalizations of the dependent and independent variables to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present data on religious conservatism and those on political conservatism ( Sugar et al. , 1992 ) accurately reflect major discontinuities between historical and contemporary conservatism , they suggest a curious irony . In a dynamic , diverse world , conservatism is changing so fast that it is no longer consistent with its earlier expressions . The conservative nature of the human mind may be all that remains . <p> The authors are grateful to Alicia S. Cook and David B. Wohl for their comments and suggestions for revision . Religious conservatives opposed vaccination on the grounds that it flies " in the face of Providence " and encroaches " on the prerogatives of Jehovah , whose right it is to wound and smite " ( White , 1896/1978 , p. 56 ) . The original version of the scale used for this study inadvertently noted that the time and introduction of the smallpox vaccine was the 17th century . Re-analysis of the data without this item did not affect the outcome of this study .

##4001168 ABSTRACT . The relationships among a cluster of attitudes toward work and job were investigated using a sample of 171 nurses . The hypothesis was that involvement in work and job , commitment to the employing organization , and satisfaction with the job ( overall , and with specific facets of the job ) would be significantly correlated . The results showed that involvement was not related to overall satisfaction but only to two specific facets , satisfaction with work and promotion opportunities . In contrast , the degree of relationship between overall and various facets of satisfaction and commitment and between involvement and commitment was moderately high . <p> Employee attitudes toward involvement in and satisfaction with the job and commitment to the employing organization have become of compelling interest to industrial psychologists because of their impact on behavior at work ( Robbins , 1993 ) . Job involvement frequently includes identifying with the job , actively participating in the job , and perceiving job performance to be important to self-worth ( Blau , 1985 ; Rabinowitz &; Hall , 1977 ) . Job satisfaction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the job or toward specific dimensions of the job ( Hodson , 1991 ) . Organizational commitment refers to identification with and loyalty to the organization and its goals ( Blau &; Boal , 1987 ) . Employee attitudes are reflected in tendencies to respond to the job and the organization and its people and situations either positively or negatively . <p> Attitudes tend to cluster and categorize themselves . A person who has developed a favorable attitude toward one aspect of the job based on unique experiences , is likely to react favorably to other related job aspects . Thus , if one is involved in a job , one is likely to be satisfied with the job and committed to the organization . A person who is dissatisfied with a job may become less involved in the work and less committed to the employer . Although attempts have been made to introduce causality -- for instance , that satisfaction determines involvement ( Mortimer &; Lorerice , 1989 ) -- studies of discriminant validity suggest that these attitudes are relatively unrelated ( Mathieu &; Farr , 1991 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these attitudes in conjunction with organizational outcomes . For example Farris ( 1971 ) , Horn , Katerberg , and Hulin ( 1979 ) , Mowday , Porter , and Steers ( 1982 ) , Blau and Boal ( 1989 ) , and Mathieu and Kohler ( 1990 ) have variously used involvement and commitment separately and interactively to predict tardiness , turnover , and absenteeism . Other researchers have linked job involvement to organizational factors ( Jans , 1985 ) and organizational commitment to influence ( Angle &; Perry , 1983 ) or work experiences ( Pierce &; Dunham , 1987 ) . However , the interrelationship of these attitudes has not been studied separately and exclusively . Only Moser and Schuler ( 1993 ) , in validating Lodahl and Kejner 's ( 1965 ) job involvement scale , predicted and found a high correlation among them . <p> In this research , I examined to what degree these attitudes were related . Generally , no causality was assumed : People may become involved in their jobs because they are satisfied with their jobs , or satisfaction may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or commitment may lead to involvement and satisfaction . However , it is also possible that " chunks " of one attitude may be related to chunks of other attitudes in many ways -- causally , acausally , or spuriously . This contention can be derived from contingency theories that predict that the strength and direction of any relationship among a set of variables is likely to vary with the individual involved and with the context within which the individual works . I hypothesized that these three job-related attitudes would be significantly related : involvement with satisfaction , satisfaction with commitment , and involvement with commitment . Method Participants <p> The participants were 171 nurse educators and registered nurses employed by 11 hospitals and 3 community colleges in southern Ontario . Two thirds of the nurses were between 35 and 45 years old . Most of them were married ( 72% ) . They had worked for their organization an average of 8 years . Instruments <p> Organizational commitment was measured with Mowday , Steers , and Porter 's ( 1979 ) Organizational Commitment Questionnaire . Two scales were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kanungo ( 1982 ) , which asks respondents to indicate the degree to which they are involved in their present job . The other asks respondents , on a 5-point scale , to what degree they are involved in their work ( as opposed to involvement with their families or with leisure activities ) . A short form of the Job Descriptive Index , developed by Hatfield , Robinson , and Huseman ( 1985 ) , was used to measure the various facets of job satisfaction . Finally , instead of using an additive version of the five facets of job satisfaction , a separate , one-item measure of overall job satisfaction was also used ( Iris &; Barrett , 1972 ) . Procedure <p> The data were collected by seven nurse educators enrolled in a graduate program in education . They distributed 245 instruments to all of the nurses employed in the hospitals and colleges surveyed . To show the relationships among the attitudes , simple Pearson correlations were calculated for all variables . The required level of significance ( p ) was set at < .01 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses to assess their respective contributions to explained variance in commitment and involvement . F values were considered significant at p < .01 . Results <p> The means and standard deviations for the variables investigated were as follows : Organizational commitment , M = 24. 1 , SD = 5.0 : overall job satisfaction , M = 3.5 , SD = 1.0 ; satisfaction with work , M = 3.9 , SD = .7 ; satisfaction with pay , M = 3.1 , SD = .9 ; satisfaction with promotion , M = 3.3 , SD = .9 ; satisfaction with supervision , M = 3.6 , SD = .9 ; satisfaction with co-workers , M = 3.9 , SD = .7 ; involvement in work , M = 4.1 , SD = .9 ; and job involvement , M = 3.7 , SD = 1.0 . Involvement and Satisfaction <p> Simple correlations showed that neither job involvement nor involvement in work were statistically related to overall job satisfaction ( r = . 19 and .16 , respectively , ns ) . However , some facets of job satisfaction were significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement . Job involvement was related to satisfaction with the work itself ( r = .33 , p < .001 ) and with opportunities for promotion ( r = .24 , p < .001 ) , but not to satisfaction with pay , supervision , or co-workers . Involvement with work was related to three of the five facets of satisfaction : work ( r = .29 , p < .001 ) , opportunities for promotion ( r = .33 , p < .001 ) , and supervision ( r = .25 , p < .001 ) . <p> Regression analyses indicated that facets of satisfaction are not powerful predictors of involvement . Concerning job involvement , only satisfaction with work entered the regression equation , explaining 11% of the variance . For involvement with work , two dimensions explained a total of 13% of the variance -- satisfaction with promotions ( 11% ) and satisfaction with work ( an additional 2% ) . Satisfaction and Commitment <p> In contrast to involvement and satisfaction , satisfaction and commitment were both statistically and meaningfully related . Commitment was related to overall job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to satisfaction with work ( r = .58 , p < .001 ) , pay ( r =.22 , p < .01 ) ; opportunities for promotion ( r = .55 , p < .001 ) , supervision ( r = .54 , p < .001 ) , and co-workers ( r = .30 , p < .001 ) . <p> When the facets of job satisfaction were subjected to a regression analysis , three facets contributed significantly to the variance in commitment . Satisfaction with the work itself explained the highest portion of the variance , 33% , followed by supervision , 13% , and promotion , 4% . Altogether , the three facets explained 50% of the variance in organizational commitment . Involvement and Commitment <p> Although involvement was not related to satisfaction , the concept was moderately related to commitment . There was a correlation between commitment and job involvement ( r = .32 , p = .001 ) . Commitment was correlated with involvement in work ( r = .38 , p = .001 ) . Involvement , Satisfaction , and Commitment <p> Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the two remaining attitudes as independent variables . The following pattern of results emerged . <p> When I treated commitment as the dependent variable and the various facets of job satisfaction and involvement as independent variables , only satisfaction but not involvement contributed to the variance in commitment . With commitment as the dependent variable and satisfaction and involvement in work as independent variables , the latter contributed only 1% additional variance to commitment in addition to the 50% contributed by satisfaction . <p> When commitment was predicted from overall job satisfaction and involvement in work , overall satisfaction contributed 41% and involvement in work an additional 7% , resulting in 48% of the overall explained variance . When overall job involvement was substituted for involvement with work , overall job satisfaction again explained 41% of the variance in commitment ; job involvement contributed an additional 4% , to result in 45% overall explained variance in commitment . <p> When I treated job satisfaction as the dependent variable and involvement and commitment as independent variables , commitment explained 41% of the variance in satisfaction , and job involvement did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commitment were regressed against the satisfaction variable , commitment also explained 41% of the variance , whereas involvement in work did not contribute to explained variance . <p> When job involvement was treated as the dependent variable , commitment explained 10% of the variance in involvement , whereas overall satisfaction did not contribute to the variance . In a separate analysis , when the facets of satisfaction and commitment were treated as independent variables , satisfaction with the work itself contributed 11% and commitment an additional 2% to the variance in involvement . <p> When the second measure , involvement with work , was substituted for overall job involvement , the pattern of variances did not change much . Commitment explained 14% of variance , whereas overall job satisfaction did not contribute to involvement with work . In the analysis of facets of satisfaction and commitment as independent variables , commitment again contributed 14% , whereas satisfaction with promotion added 2% , for a total of 16% of explained variance in involvement in work . Discussion <p> For this sample of nurses , three conclusions can be drawn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of relationship between satisfaction and commitment was moderately high , between satisfaction and involvement was negligible , and between involvement and commitment was moderate . <p> Clearly , involvement in work or job was related to commitment to , and identification with , the employing organization , but not to satisfaction . The findings also suggest that involvement does not necessarily lead to satisfaction . Why is this the case ? The answer may have to do with the nature of the work . People may become enveloped and drawn into work that is difficult , troublesome , or dangerous , leading to a discharge of obligations rather than pleasure . Alternatively , as Hackman and Oldham ( 1980 ) suggested , the work may be perceived as repetitive and routine , lacking in variety or significance . In both cases , the nature of the work may still demand involvement but may not lead to satisfaction . <p> Another set of explanations pertains more to the personality of the person doing the work than to the work itself . People may not be satisfied with the job because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their needs , especially the higher-order needs , for instance , for autonomy , achievement , or competence . Or perhaps satisfaction of these needs does occur but leads to overinvolvement , which in turn results in low job satisfaction . Also , work may merely lead to the satisfaction of lower-order needs , like pay and security . " I am involved in my work because I have to feed the children and pay the rent , not because I like the work " may be a typical response . <p> Furthermore , different types of personalities ( Jung , 1971 ) may become involved and derive satisfaction in different ways . In short , it is equally likely that ( a ) people become involved and do derive satisfaction , ( b ) people become involved but do not derive satisfaction , ( 3 ) people do not become involved and do not derive satisfaction , or ( 4 ) people do not become involved yet do derive satisfaction ( with pay and/or co-workers , for example ) . <p> These reflections on aspects of job involvement are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rabinowitz and Hall 's ( 1977 ) , and Blau 's ( 1985 ) explanations of involvement . It is possible that the absence of these aspects in the definition and measurement of job involvement accounts for the elusiveness ( Knoop , 1986 ) or entanglement ( Mortimer &; Lorence , 1989 ) of the concept . It seems likely that people get involved in work or job for reasons other than identification , participation , or self-worth , the accepted ingredients of the definition of involvement . <p> Yet the necessity of becoming involved , in order to keep a job , for example , could also lead to commitment , especially if commitment was perceived differently . Instead of identification or loyalty , as Blau and Boal ( 1987 ) advocated , commitment could mean making a pledge or promise to the employer . An individual could well pledge to stay with an organization and to get involved in difficult work that brings little gratification to discharge an obligation . <p> The relationship between satisfaction and commitment is easier to explain . Satisfaction with the work itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be related to commitment . These findings seem logical . When one likes one 's job or work and derives contentment from it , one can see oneself staying with it and with the organization offering this work . This finding implies that commitment can decrease if the job ceases to be challenging or interesting , either because the job gets changed or because the job holder gets bored with it . <p> The present study needs to be replicated in other work settings . Nurses may derive satisfaction and gratification from caring for patients , but they may not want to get too involved with their patients ' illnesses . Nurses may also be committed to their organization because they chose nursing as a profusion ; the particular hospital they are employed in may not mean as much as the profession itself . <p> 
##4001169 ABSTRACT . Conceptual level ( CL ) has been proposed as an important individual difference variable related to counselor training and effectiveness . However , relatively little attention has been paid to CL measurement issues in relation to counseling . Previous researchers have concluded that counselor CL is related to counselor training and counseling outcomes . A meta-analysis of 10 studies using counselors or counselor trainees as participants and outcomes based on counseling interviews showed the relationship between counselor CL and outcome to be inconsistent and weak . Although further research into CL and counseling appears warranted , such research will require valid domain-specific procedures for measuring counselor CL . <p> It has been accepted generally for some time that personality dispositions measured by conventional self-report personality inventories are not consistently related to counselor effectiveness or counselor training outcome ( Loesch , Crane , &; Rucker , 1978 ; Rowe , Murphy , &; DeCsipkes , 1975 ) . Counseling psychology researchers have investigated possible relationships between counselors ' performance and their characteristic global ways of conceptualizing . Harvey , Hunt , and Schroder ( 1961 ) defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides the basis by which the individual relates to the environmental events he experiences " ( pp.244-245 ) . <p> Hunt ( 1970a , 1970b , 1971 ) proposed conceptual level ( CL ) as the major person variable in a person-environment interaction model of interpersonal functioning . He defined CL as " a personality characteristic that describes persons on a developmental hierarchy of increasing conceptual complexity , self-responsibility and independence " ( Hunt , 1978 , p. 78 ) . The most generally accepted implication of Hunt 's work is that high-CL individuals are more likely to benefit from those learning environments that encourage discovery learning , whereas low-CL individuals are more likely to benefit from learning environments that are relatively more structured and emphasize following the rules ( Miller , 1978 , 1981 ; Miller &; Wilson , 1979 ) . Several authors have discussed possible implications of Hunt 's proposals concerning CL in relation to counseling ( Berg &; Stone , 1980 ; Holloway &; Wolleat , 1980 ) . <p> Two general hypotheses related to counseling have been derived from CL theory . The first ( represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or counselor training setting is inherently ambiguous and poorly structured , high-CL counselors or counselor trainees will tend to perform better than their low-CL counterparts on average . The second general hypothesis ( represented by Type B studies ) is that high-CL counselors or trainees will perform relatively better in more ambiguous and unstructured situations , whereas low-CL counselors or trainees will perform relatively better in more structured situations . A corollary is that counseling will be more effective when counselor and client are matched on the basis of their CL ( high with high , low with low ) . Conceptualizing and Measuring Counselor CL <p> Miller ( 1981 ) described conceptual systems theory as " a personality theory that focuses on individual differences in social cognition within a developmental framework " ( p. 34 ) and proposed that the theory characterizes persons in terms of the structure and content of their conceptual systems . In most accounts , conceptual system complexity is identified as the key element , where high levels of complexity imply high levels of both cognitive differentiation and cognitive integration ( Miller &; Wilson , 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cognitive integration go together , others ( notably Miller , 1981 ) have commented that the relationship between these two cognitive structure qualities is far from clear in that " high differentiation may actually hinder the development of integrative skills " ( p. 35 ) . <p> In a counseling interview , a counselor must not only be able to make differentiations and discriminations in relation to client behavior and experiences in the course of a counseling interview or series of interviews , but must also be selective so as to use the most relevant information and be able to integrate this information so as to respond appropriately to the client 's real needs . It is suggested that the methods of measuring counselor CL used most frequently emphasize the differentiation and discrimination aspect of CL but fail to address adequately the selection and integration of information aspect . <p> The most widely used procedure for estimating CL involves participants undertaking a paragraph- or sentence-completion task by writing personal responses to a series of topics ( Harvey , 1966 ; Hunt , Butler , Noy , &; Rosser , 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Responses are rated for their level of conceptual abstractness , in which higher ratings are given for expression of several alternatives and the ability to hold multiple viewpoints ( Hunt , 1970a ) . This assessment procedure assumes that structural complexity necessarily implies structural integration . However , apparent complexity can be associated with disintegration , and the standard rating systems appear not to take this into account in estimating an individual 's apparent CL . <p> The second procedure for assessing CL is to use a role construct repertory grid technique , based on proposals by Bieri ( 1955 ) , to measure a participant 's level of cognitive complexity . Carr 's ( 1965 ) Interpersonal Discrimination Test requires participants to rate a set of significant other individuals using a list of bipolar adjective pairs ( or constructs ) . A ( relatively ) cognitively simple participant will apply the bipolar adjectives in much the same way to most of the individuals in the set , whereas a cognitively complex participant will apply the adjectives differently to individuals in the set . <p> Several quantitative procedures can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; such as the percentage of variance in the individual x Adjectives rating grid accounted for by the first principal component of the grid : the smaller the percentage , the more cognitively complex is the individual . The major shortcoming with all such grid rating analysis procedures is that they fail to distinguish true cognitive complexity from cognitive disorganization -- or even random responding -- because all three processes will result in low correlations among the bipolar adjective pairs . <p> Both of these most frequently used approaches to the measurement of CL are therefore potentially inadequate . Each may be sensitive to the differentiation and discrimination components of CL but fail to tap the integration , or quality of organization , component implied in the CL construct . <p> A further shortcoming of the standard paragraph- or sentence-completion method for measuring CL in counseling research is that the topics involved are very general and have little overlap with the domain of interpersonal helping : for example , " When I am in doubt ... " or " What I think about rules ... " ( Harvey et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue when he reported non-significant correlations between scores on the standard paragraph-completion measure of CL and scores on his Teacher Adaptability Index , a CL measure with teaching-specific content : <p> The most likely explanation for these low correlations is the very generalized , non-specific nature of the Conceptual Level ( CL ) measure . When a CL-type Index is put into a more domain-specific content , as the " Attitude to Teaching " measure , the relationship is considerably higher . ( p. 333 ) <p> This explanation implies that the paragraph- and sentence-completion methods typically used to measure CL as a global quality of counselors ' conceptual systems may be unable to show that CL is related strongly to performance in actual counseling interviews because the item content is related only tenuously to the specific interpersonal demands of the counseling situation . <p> In addition to these potential shortcomings in methods of measuring counselor CL , there is little evidence that the different approaches tap the same psychological processes . Whereas the Paragraph Completion Test ( Schroder et al. , 1967 ) and the Paragraph Completion Method ( Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives results correlated with those of Harvey 's ( 1966 ) This I Believe Test ( Miller , 1978 ) . Vannoy ( 1965 ) found that the Paragraph Completion Test was unrelated to cognitive complexity scores derived from interpersonal bipolar adjective rating grids . This apparent lack of convergent validity among CL measures casts doubt on the comparability of research findings based on different approaches to CL measurement . <p> This discussion of the shortcomings in methods currently used to measure counselor CL suggests that , regardless of any potential merits of CL theory in relation to counseling and counselor training , problematic aspects of current methods of measuring counselor CL make it difficult for researchers to actually demonstrate a strong relationship between counselor CL and performance . Reviews of Research on CL and Counseling <p> Two reviews of research on counseling and CL have been reported ( Holloway &; Wampold , 1986 ; Stoppard &; Miller , 1985 ) , covering 28 published studies and revealing considerable diversity , making it difficult to draw general conclusions : Two characteristics on which studies differed seem particularly important . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or counselor trainees ) , or whether it focused on other kinds of individuals , such as clients or research volunteers . Clearly , conclusions about counselor CL and performance based on data generated by individuals other than counselors are somewhat uncertain , given that differing motivational sets would probably be brought to the research task by participants other than counselors . <p> The second characteristic is whether the dependent , or outcome , variables used in a particular study were based on counseling interviews , or whether they involved some other analog procedure , such as responding to written or taped client statement vignettes . Several authors have drawn attention to the fact that noninterview-based measures of counselor performance are related tenuously , at best , to counseling interview effectiveness ( Ford , 1979 ; Matarazzo , 1978 ) . In addition , as Miller ( 1981 ) noted , CL differences are most likely to find expression in complex interpersonal behaviors rather than in relatively simple tasks such as responding to multiple choice counseling response tests or writing responses to written client statements . <p> Stoppard and Miller ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of matching individuals ' CL with the level of environmental structure ( Type g research studies ) . This was a traditional voting or box score review ; Stoppard and Miller concluded that results in 11 of the studies supported Hunt 's matching hypothesis , and they suggested that the findings warranted further research into matching clients and counselors on CL . However , of the 15 studies they examined , only 2 used counselors or trainee counselors as participants and relied on interviews as a basis for determining outcome . Of these 2 studies , I reported a significant positive outcome ( McLachlan , 1972 ) ; the other ( Rosenthal , 1977 ) did not . The other 13 studies used student research volunteers , or clients , or trainee teachers as participants and/or did not rely on outcomes involving counseling interviews . <p> Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) carried out a quantitative meta-analysis of 23 reports ( published prior to September 1983 ) that examined either the direct relationship between CL and counseling effectiveness ( Type A studies ) or the effect of matching participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be noted that a Type B study will also typically provide Type A data in the form of a main effect for counselor CL in addition to the Type B result in the form of a counselor/client CL interaction effect . <p> Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) used standard meta-analytic procedures ( Glass , McGaw , &; Smith , 1981 ) to convert group mean differences or correlations into standard effect sizes ( ES ) and regression analyses to identify any relationships between the magnitude of effect sizes and other moderating variables such as type of participant and rated design adequacy . Holloway and Wampold reported a mean ES for Type A studies of 1.07 : that is , the outcome measure score of the average high-CL participant exceeded that of 86% of low-CL participants . However , there was no evidence of a corresponding main ( or Type A ) effect for CL in their Type B ( interaction effect ) studies : ES = 0.02 . <p> Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) explained these discrepant findings as perhaps stemming from the relatively poorer methodologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean interaction ES for matching participants ( high CL or low CL ) with environments ( low structure or high structure , respectively ) of 0.15 ; that is , the outcome measure score of the average participant in a matched condition exceeded that of 56% of participants in an unmatched condition . Holloway and Wampold concluded that <p> The findings of Type A studies imply that high-CL rather than low-CL individuals may be preferable as applicants to counselor training programs due to their superior performance on perceptual tasks in complex , ambiguous situations . Type B studies , by testing the effectiveness of using a matching model to increase the effectiveness of a person 's performance , provide support for the more prescriptive technological approach . It appears that low-CL persons only need to be in more structured conditions to benefit from training or counseling environment . ( p. 318 ) <p> In their discussion of their positive conclusions concerning the importance of counselor CL in relation to training and performance , Holloway and Wampold acknowledged that studies in their review were disparate in many ways and should best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than with counseling solely . <p> I decided to re-examine the studies reviewed by Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) , placing my attention only on those that focused on counselor CL and used counseling interviews as a basis for determining counseling or training outcome . Reappraising Counselor CL and Performance <p> Of the 23 reports reviewed by Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) , 7 were not related directly to the outcome of training in counseling or to the effectiveness of counselors . Of the remaining 16 studies , 10 did not use performance in an interview situation to provide an outcome or performance measure . Thus , only 6 of 23 studies were concerned directly with the performance of counselors or counselor trainees in an interview situation . These studies are summarized in Table 1 . They include the two studies described previously by Stoppard and Miller ( 1985 ) : McLachlan ( 1972 ) and Rosenthal ( 1977 ) . <p> In view of the small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria , I decided to see whether more studies could be located . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented by a hand search , to locate eight additional reports concerning counselor or counselor trainee CL and performance published up to December 1992 . Of these , four did not involve individuals conducting an interview . The remaining four studies ( using interviews ) are summarized in Table 1 . <p> Restricting consideration only to studies that focused on counselors or counselor trainees involved in some form of interview as the basis for assessing counselor performance or counselor training outcome resulted in inconsistent and equivocal evidence for a relationship between CL and counselor performance . Of the 10 studies listed in Table 1 , 5 showed that CL was related to counseling performance or counselor training outcome . Lutwak and Hennessy ( 1982 ) found that empathy level following training was related to trainees ' CL . MacLachlan ( 1976 ) claimed indirect evidence that clients may perceive high-CL counselors more positively than low-CL counselors : clients of low-CL counselors were more likely to discontinue prematurely . Mayadas and Duehn ( 1978 ) found that high-CL counselors performed better than low-CL counselors , and that CL was related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that group psychotherapy patients who were matched for CL level with therapist CL level showed greater average improvement than patients not matched with their therapist on CL level . O'Brien ( 1984 ) found evidence that counselor CL was related to client self-rated outcome . However , the other five studies reported no significant relationship between CL and counselor performance or training outcome . On a simple voting basis , these findings suggest that counselor CL is probably unrelated to performance , because the number of studies reporting significant positive findings equaled the number of studies reporting nonsignificant findings . <p> Reviews based on simply counting the proportion of studies returning significant results have been criticized on the grounds that such a narrow approach is insensitive to overall trends in findings ( Wolf , 1986 ) . Accordingly , I conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of the findings in the 10 studies contained in Table 1 . The procedures described by Holloway and Wampold ( 1986 ) were used to calculate effect sizes for both main effects due to counselor CL ( Type A ) and for interactions ( or matchings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all cases , the Hedges ( 1982 ) Formula 4 correction was applied to produce unbiased effect sizes , correcting for small sample size , using the program EFFECT ( Omodei , 1993 ) to make the calculations . Following the recommendations of Berman , Miller , and Massman ( 1985 ) , in those studies that used multiple outcome measures , I derived an overall effect size by averaging the effect sizes calculated for each outcome measure . Failure to do so would have arbitrarily weighted the importance of studies according to the number of outcome measures used . <p> The overall average Type A ES ( for the two Type A and eight Type B studies combined ) was 0.59 . That is , the client outcome measure score of the average high-CL counselor exceeded that of 72% of low-CL counselors . The overall average Type B ( or matching ) ES was 0.31 . That is , the outcome measure score for the average client in a matched condition exceeded that of 62% of the clients in an unmatched condition . However , the overall average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutwak and Hennessy ( 1982 ) and Mayadas and Duehn ( 1978 ) reported quite large effect sizes . <p> Lutwak and Hennessy ( 1982 ; Type A ES = 2.22 ) exercised no experimental control over the counseling interviews conducted by their participants , who simply recruited volunteers from among their acquaintances to serve as analog clients in informally arranged interviews . This may well have allowed uncontrolled motivational factors to inflate the relationship between CL and counseling performance . Mayadas and Duehn ( 1978 ; Type A ES = 2.9 , Type B ES = 1.7 ) relied simply on changes in the frequency of use of six counseling microskills by their counselor trainees as the outcome variables . <p> As Hill ( 1990 ) noted , there is no evidence that use of particular forms of counselor responses is necessarily associated with greater counselor effectiveness ; thus , using this type of outcome variable as a measure of counselor performance is questionable . If these two studies are dropped from the analysis , then the overall average Type A ( simple main effect ) ES falls to 0.09 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching effect ) ES falls to 0.19 . That is , using these more conservative estimates of overall effect size , the client outcome measure score of the average high-CL counselor exceeded that of 54% of low-CL counselors , and the outcome measure score for the average client in a matched condition exceeded that of 58% of clients in an unmatched condition . These are very small effect sizes ( Wolf , 1986 ) , and at this juncture it must be concluded that the proposed relationship between counselor CL and performance in counseling interviews is inconsistent and weak . <p> With only eight studies judged to be methodologically sound , it was difficult to explore what factors might be associated with relatively larger effects for CL . Six studies used actual counseling clients . The average main effect ( Type A ) ES for these was 0.09 , the average interaction effect ( Type B ) ES was 0.16 . Two studies used role-playing clients and the corresponding values were 0.11 and 0.29 , respectively . The overall average ES for the five studies that used the Paragraph Completion Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Completion Method ( Hunt et al , 1978 ) was greater ( Type A = 0.17 , Type B = 0.35 ) than that of the one study that used Harvey 's ( 1966 ) This I Believe Test ( MacLachlan , 1972 ) or the two studies that used combined measures ( Blaas &; Heck , 1978 ; Larimer , 1978 ) . Discussion <p> The merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis procedures have been discussed by several writers ( e.g. , Wolf , 1986 ) , and there is substantial agreement that such approaches are preferred generally to less sophisticated alternative review methods , such as simple enumeration of outcomes . There seems to be little doubt that the general quantitative meta-analytic strategy of including all studies relevant to the topic and relying on multiple regression techniques to establish the relative importance of various factors ( including methodological differences ) should be the method of choice when a large number of studies have been published that clearly involve the variables of central interest . <p> In the present case , however , inspection of the content of the 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that only iO ( 28% ) actually focused on counselors or counselor trainees and used performance in an interview as the basis for assessing outcome . I judged that , with such a small number of studies fulfilling these important criteria , it was potentially misleading to aggregate them with the much greater number of studies that did not meet the criteria . <p> The 10 studies contained in Table 1 are quite disparate in detail . Apart from methodological weaknesses in the studies of Mayadas and Duehn ( 1978 ) and Lutwak and Hennessy ( 1982 ) , no feature could be identified confidently that distinguished those studies with larger effect sizes from those reporting smaller effect sizes . In light of the earlier discussion of shortcomings in existing CL measures in relation to the counseling setting , the finding of even a weak relationship between counselor CL and counselor performance , using a set of studies selected on the basis of very stringent inclusion criteria , suggests that further research into counselor CL and counseling is warranted . However , such research is unlikely to prove fruitful until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the absence of counseling-specific measures , counselor CL takes on the status of a static global personality disposition related only indirectly to the specific cognitive structures underlying those processes that mediate a counselor 's behaviors during a counseling interview . <p> There thus appears to be a need for the development of a measure of counselor cognitive structure that is content-specific to the counseling interview domain . This need could be addressed in several ways . First , it may be sufficient to modify existing approaches : that is , ( a ) to construct a paragraph- or sentence-completion task involving items whose content relates more directly to beliefs about counseling , or ( b ) to develop an interpersonal constructs rating grid with elements describing client characteristics and to devise scoring systems that address both the complexity and the integration components of CL . <p> Alternatively , it may be that new approaches to measuring counselor CL are required in order to determine empirically whether CL is an individual difference variable related strongly to counselor training outcome and counselor performance . In this regard , results of a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that counselor cognitive complexity may not be a fixed traitlike dispositional characteristic that a counselor brings with him or her into every interview but may rather be a dynamic quality that depends to some extent on the nature of a particular counseling interview . Developing such a measure would entail using procedures that assess counselor CL in action rather than as a fixed personality characteristic . <p> In the meantime , there appears to be little empirical justification for using existing procedures as a basis for selecting counselor trainees , assigning trainees to more versus less structured training conditions , or matching clients with counselors , regardless of the attractiveness of CL theory for some counselor educators .

##4001170 ABSTRACT . Effects of adult attachment style on the perception of and search for social support were examined . One hundred and fifty undergraduate students completed self-report scales tapping their attachment styles , the extent to which they perceive the availability of emotional and instrumental support from significant figures ( father , mother , same-sex friend , opposite-sex friend , romantic partner ) , and the extent to which they look for instrumental and emotional assistance in times of need : Findings showed that secure persons perceived higher levels of emotional and instrumental support from the assessed figures and reported seeking more emotional and instrumental support than avoidant and ambivalent persons did . Results are discussed in the context of an attachment perspective of social support . <p> The contribution of social support to well-being has been one of the major areas of psychological research during the last decade . Social support is a multidimensional construct that may be defined as the comfort , assistance , and/or information one receives through formal or informal social contacts ( Wallston , Alagna , DeVellis , &; DeVellis , 1983 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social support -- the generalized appraisal that one is cared for and valued -- is related to particular personality traits ( Lakey &; Heller , 1988 ; Sarason , Shearin , Pierce , &; Sarason , 1987 ) . The present study followed this idea and examined the relationship between one basic personality characteristic , attachment style , and a sense of social support . <p> Attachment theory ( Bowlby , 1969 , 1973 , 1980 ) can serve as a theoretical framework for studying how the sense of social support originates . In our terms , a sense of social support can be related to the concept of secure attachment . Bowlby defined secure relationships in infancy as those interactions in which parents are responsive to infants ' distress , assist infants in regulating tension , and bring relief and comfort . The responsiveness of parents to infants ' distress signals and their availability in stressful situations provide infants with a " secure base " and foster the sense of a " good-supportive world . " This relationship between attachment and social support has been also emphasized by Sarason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the formation of attachment styles may be related to the development of the sense of social support . Securely attached children , who experience supportive relationships with attachment figures and use these figures as a " secure base " ( Ainsworth , Blehar , Waters , &; Wall , 1978 ) , may develop a strong sense of social support . In contrast , insecurely attached children ( either avoidant or ambivalent ) , who grow up with doubts about the extent to which attachment figures can comfort them in times of stress ( Ainsworth et al. , 1978 ) , may develop a generalized belief in a " non-supportive world . " <p> Early attachment experiences and the resulting sense of social support may have important implications for personality and social development . Bowlby ( 1973 ) claimed that the individual 's attachment style is a stable personality pattern and that it organizes cognition , emotion , and behavior throughout life . Several studies have provided evidence on the stability of attachment style ( Arend , Gove , &; Sroufe , 1979 ; Sroufe , 1983 ) and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Noller , 1990 ; Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ; Mikulincer &; Erev , 1991 ) and cope with stress ( Collins &; Read , 1990 ; Kobak &; Sceery , 1988 ; Mikulincer , Florlan , &; Tolmacz , 1990 ) . <p> There is also evidence indicating an association between adult attachment style and social support . Kobak and Sceery ( 1988 ) found that secure persons reported having more available support from their families than avoidant persons did . Simpson , Rholes , and Nelligan ( 1992 ) found that secure women were more likely than avoidant women to seek emotional support from their partners before undergoing an anxiety-provoking experience in the laboratory . Mikulincer , Florian , and Weller ( 1993 ) found that secure Israeli adults reported seeking more social support than either avoidant or ambivalent adults did as a way of coping with the Iraqi SCUD missile attacks on Israeli cities . <p> The problem with those studies is that they did not address the multifaceted nature of social support . Specifically , they did not differentiate between different components of social support ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , parents , friends , lovers ) . <p> The perception of and search for social support are far from being unitary concepts ; rather , they appear to be differentiated along several dimensions . Cutrona ( 1990 ) differentiated between emotional support ( expression of comfort and caring ) and instrumental support ( provision of services , resources , and problem-solving means ) . Although high correlations have been found between these two components ( Brown , 1986 ; House , Kahn , McLeod , &; Williams , 1985 ) , some recent studies have demonstrated their existence via confirmatory factor analysis ( Brookings &; Bolton , 1988 ; Cutrona &; Russell , 1987 ; Vaux , Riedel , &; Stewart , 1987 ) . In addition , another differentiation has been made according to the identity of the supportive figure -- family members , friends , or romantic partners ( Cohen , 1988 ; Sarason et al. , 1987 ) . <p> In the current study , we examined the association of attachment style and self-reports on the perception of and search for social support . Undergraduate students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they have and search for emotional and instrumental support from their mothers , fathers , same-sex friends , opposite-sex friends , and romantic partners . <p> We hypothesized that secure adults , who had experienced supportive relationships ( Shaver &; Hazan , 1993 ) , would be more likely to perceive available social support in times of need than avoidant and ambivalent adults , who had experienced rejecting or inconsistent relationships with attachment figures . In addition , both avoidant and ambivalent persons would be less prone to search for support than secure persons would , but their tendency would reflect different psychological reasons . On the one hand , avoidant persons would not search for support because they rely on themselves and maintain distance from others ( Bowlby , 1982 ) . On the other hand , ambivalent persons would not seek support because of their strong fear of rejection ( Mikulincer et al , 1990 ) . <p> We also hypothesized that the tendency of secure persons to perceive and seek more support than avoidant and ambivalent persons may be found mainly when assessing emotional components and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support concerns experiences with parents who have been successful or unsuccessful in bringing emotional relief . However , if attachment style is generalized across interactions and domains ( Bowlby , 1973 ) , the effects of attachment styles may also be found with regard to instrumental support and extrafamilial interactions . Method Participants <p> One hundred and fifty undergraduate students ( 85 women and 65 men ranging in age from 21 to 28 years ) from the social science faculty at Bar-Ilan University volunteered to participate in the study without monetary reward . Of these participants , 85% were single . Materials and Procedure <p> The volunteers were asked to participate in a study on social relations , and they filled out the questionnaire during regular class time . They answered questions on scales tapping attachment and social support in random order . The procedure took approximately 30 min . <p> Attachment styles were assessed via two instruments previously used by Mikulincer et al . ( 1990 ) . First , participants read the three Hazan and Shaver descriptions of feelings and cognitions regarding attachment styles and endorsed the description that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 statements ( five items per attachment style ) , constructed by decomposing Hazan and Shaver 's descriptions ( for more details , see Mikulincer et al. , 1990 ) . Cronbach alphas for the three attachment factors were acceptable ( from .75 to .84 ) . On that basis , we averaged items corresponding to each factor , compared those scores , and assigned each participant to the attachment style that had the maximal value of the three alternatives . <p> Only five mismatches resulted from comparing the results of the two techniques . No clear pattern was detected in these failures to coincide . To avoid classification ambiguities , we decided to drop those cases from the analyses . Frequencies of attachment styles in the current sample were similar to those in previous studies with American and Israeli samples ( Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ; Mikulincer et al. , 1990 ) . Fifty-nine percent of the participants ( n = 86 ) were classified as secure , 30% as avoidant ( n = 43 ) , and 11% as ambivalent ( n = 16 ) . <p> Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . The Perceived Available Instrumental and Emotional Support Scale ( PAIESS ) tapped the extent to which five figures ( mother , father , same-sex friend , opposite-sex friend , and romantic partner ) were perceived as providing instrumental and emotional support . The Seeking of Instrumental and Emotional Support Scale ( SIESS ) tapped the extent to which the respondent looked for instrumental and emotional support from those figures during difficult times . <p> The PAIESS , a 14-item , self-report questionnaire , was constructed on the basis of items selected and translated into Hebrew ( using a back-translation technique ) from the Social Support Questionnaire ( Sarason , Levine , Basham , &; Sarason , 1983 ) , the Social Support Perception Scale ( Vaux , 1985 ) , and the Social Support Behavior Scale ( Vaux et al. , 1987 ) . The PAIESS included seven items tapping instrumental support ( e.g. , " My father is ready to assist me financially when I need it " ) and seven items tapping emotional support ( e.g. , " My father is ready to listen to my innermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which a particular person provided support on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 , not at all , to 6 , very much . They completed five versions of the PAIESS , each for a different figure . The order of the versions was randomized across participants . <p> Factor analyses with varimax rotation conducted separately for each PAIESS version yielded two main factors ( eigenvalue > 1 ) , which explained 65% to 73% of the variance . The first factor ( between 42% and 51% of explained variance ) included the seven instrumental support items ( loading > .40 ) . The second factor ( between 13% and 22% of the variance ) included the seven emotional support items . Cronbach 's alpha coefficients were appropriate ( between .83 and .89 for instrumental support items and between .79 and .92 for emotional support items ) . On that basis , we computed two scores of perceived instrumental support and perceived emotional support for each figure by averaging the items loading high on each factor . Higher score reflected more perceived support . <p> The SIESS , a 10-item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items selected from the Hebrew version of the Ways of Coping Checklist ( Folkman &; Lazarus , 1980 ) . The SIESS included five items tapping instrumental support ( e.g. , " I ask for advice from my father about solving the problem " ) and 5 items tapping emotional support ( e.g. , " I seek sympathy and understanding from my father " ) . Participants rated the degree to which they seek support in difficult times from a particular person , on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 , not at all , to 6 , very much . They completed five versions of the SIESS , each for a different figure , as mentioned earlier . The order of the versions was randomized across participants . <p> Factor analyses with varimax rotation conducted separately for each SIESS version yielded two main factors that explained 68% to 78% of the variance . The first factor explained 57% and 71% of the variance , and it was composed of the five instrumental support items . The second factor explained between 7% and 11% of the variance , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha coefficients were appropriate ( between .76 and .85 for instrumental support items and between .84 and .90 for emotional support items ) . On this basis , we computed two scores for the search for instrumental and emotional support for each figure by averaging the items loading high on each factor . Higher scores reflected a higher tendency to seek support . Results <p> We analyzed the data by three-way analyses of variance ( ANOVAs ) for attachment style ( secure , avoidant , ambivalent ) , component of support ( instrumental , emotional ) , and identity of the figure ( father , mother , same-sex friend , opposite sex-friend , and partner ) . The two last factors were treated as within-subject repeated measures. 1 <p> The three-way ANOVA on the perception of available support yielded a significant main effect for attachment style , F(2,142) = 9.27 , p < .01 . Duncan post hoc tests ( alpha = .05 ) indicated that secure persons perceived more available support ( M = 5.01 ) than avoidant ( M = 4.57 ) and ambivalent persons ( M = 4.40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results for avoidant and ambivalent persons . The interactions of attachment style with the two other factors were not significant , implying that attachment groups differed in their perception of support availability regardless of the component of support endorsed and the identity of the support provider . Secure persons reported having more available support in all the categories assessed than insecure persons did ( see Table 1 for means and univariate F ratios ) . <p> The three-way ANOVA also yielded significant main effects for component of support , F(1,142) = 8.18 , p < .01 , and identity of the figure , F(4,559) = 13.82 , p < .01 . Participants perceived more emotional support ( M = 4.87 ) than instrumental support ( M = 4.76 ) . In addition , Duncan post hoc tests indicated that they reported that romantic partners provided more support ( M = 5.08 ) than did mothers ( M = 4.88 ) and same-sex friends ( M = 4.87 ) , who , in turn , were perceived as providing more support than opposite-sex friends ( M = 4.66 ) and fathers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects were qualified by a significant two-way interaction for component of support and identity of the figure , F(4,559) = 52.05 , p < .01 . Tests for simple main effects ( Winer , 1971 ) indicated that participants perceived their romantic partners and friends to provide more emotional than instrumental support . In contrast , they perceived their fathers to provide more instrumental than emotional support . Mothers were perceived as providing equal amounts of emotional and instrumental support ( see Table 1 ) . <p> The three-way ANOVA on the search for social support yielded a significant main effect for attachment style , F(9,142) = 8.57 , p < .01 . Duncan tests indicated that secure persons reported seeking more social support in dealing with life problems ( M = 4.15 ) than avoidant ( M = 3.66 ) and ambivalent persons ( M = 3.42 ) did . No significant difference was found between avoidant and ambivalent persons . Secure persons reported seeking more social support in most of the categories assessed than insecure persons ( see Table 2 , means and F ratios ) . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , F(1,142) = 13.46 , p < .01 , and identity of the supportive figure , F(4,559) = 45.96 , p < .01 . Participants reported seeking more instrumental ( M = 4.01 ) than emotional support ( M = 3.85 ) . Duncan tests indicated that romantic partners were preferred as supportive figures ( M = 4.67 ) over same-sex friends ( M = 4.19 ) , who , in turn , were preferred over mothers and opposite-sex friends ( M = 3.75 , M = 3.71 , respectively ) . Fathers were the least preferred supportive figures ( M = 3.36 ) . <p> Those two main effects were qualified by a significant two-way interaction for component of support and identity of supportive figure , F(4,559) = 23.18 , p < .01 . Tests for simple main effects indicated that fathers were sought out for more instrumental than emotional support . Romantic partners , mothers , and friends were equally sought out for emotional and instrumental support ( see Table 2 ) . <p> To examine the association between the perception and seeking of social support , we computed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the correlations between the perception and seeking of support were relatively high -- between .50 and .69 -- in the total sample ( see Table 3 ) : A similar pattern was identified among both secure and avoidant persons . With regard to ambivalent persons , however , the pattern of correlations differed . We found significant associations between the perception and seeking of social support only for the emotional component of support . This pattern may imply that ambivalent persons did not perceive the availability of instrumental support as related to the extent to which they search for it . Discussion <p> In the present study we examined the association between adult attachment styles and sense of social support . In general , the findings support the hypothesis that attachment groups differ in the extent to which they perceive available emotional and instrumental support from significant others . In addition , attachment groups were found to differ in their tendency to seek support in times of need . <p> The pattern of social support shown by secure persons was in line with the predictions . Those persons have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of need and were responsive to signals of distress ( Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ) . This attachment history creates expectations that significant others will be available when needed and will be able to bring comfort and relief ( Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ) . In the present study , these expectations are reflected in secure persons ' tendency to see significant others as providing relatively high levels of support . This trust in significant others may also underlie secure persons ' tendency to seek support . Because secure persons perceive others as efficient means for affect regulation , they would be prone to seek their company in times of need . <p> The pattern of social support shown by insecure persons , either avoidant or ambivalent , is also in line with our predictions . Insecure persons have a history of relationships with figures who were not responsive and available in times of need ( Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ) . They grow up with worries about the intentions and responses of significant others . They may perceive the surrounding social world as a threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social interactions for help coping with life 's adversities ( see , e.g. , Hazan &; Shaver , 1987 ) . This basic mistrust is reflected in insecure persons ' tendency to perceive a relatively low level of available instrumental and emotional support from others and their relatively low tendency to seek social support in times of need . <p> Ambivalent persons differed from secure persons not only in the degree of their perception and seeking of social support but also in the association between those two support-related constructs . Whereas secure persons showed a positive correlation between the perception and seeking of support , ambivalent persons showed low correlations for instrumental support . Possibly the search for instrumental support among ambivalent persons is guided more by their own basic anxieties than by a rational decision based on the availability of support . This interpretation is consistent with previous findings that ambivalent persons are not highly attuned to relevant information available in their social surroundings ( Mikulincer &; Nachshon , 1991 ) . <p> With regard to support seeking , our findings are in line with an earlier study ( Mikulincer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coped with the Iraqi missile attacks on Israeli cities . Our findings also provide partial support for the findings of Simpson et al . ( 1992 ) on support seeking within couples in an anxiety-provoking situation . Although both of those studies indicated that avoidant persons seek less support in times of need than secure persons do , only in the present study were significant differences found between ambivalent and secure attachment groups . A clear interpretation of this empirical discrepancy is problematic , because the two studies used entirely different methodologies . <p> The present findings were in line with the suggestion by Sarason et al . ( 1990 ) that the sense of social support has a personality substrata . Even though the objective presence or absence of supportive relationships may contribute to a sense of social support , the way a person appraises and reacts to them may also be determined by his or her personality . In this theoretical context , attachment style may be an important personality contributor to the sense of social support , but it can not be considered the exclusive or most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to attachment style ( e.g. , hardiness , social orientation ) , may also shape a person 's appraisal of , attitudes toward , and reactions to social support . <p> Our findings also show that attachment styles were similarly and significantly related to the emotional and instrumental components of social support that were provided by intra- and extrafamilial figures . These findings can be explained on the basis of the self-confirming property of cognitive schemata such as attachment styles , which generalize expectations beyond the original intrafamilial interaction . Through such a generalization , secure persons come to expect the receipt of support from the social word , whereas insecure persons have doubts about the responsiveness of that world . This reasoning suggests that differences in attachment style reflect general positive or negative orientations toward the social world . <p> The present study also delineates the particular structure of the sense of social support among young adults . It seems that the support provided by romantic partners and friends may be more appropriate to the needs of young adults than that provided by parents . Moreover , our sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of support they could provide : Romantic partners and friends were perceived mainly as sources of emotional support , fathers were perceived as potential sources of instrumental support , and mothers were perceived as the providers of both instrumental and emotional types of support . <p> Our findings and their interpretation should be viewed as an initial step in the exploration of the complex association between personality and social support . Several possible limitations of the present study may reduce the theoretical generalizability of the findings . First , we did not examine differences among attachment groups in actual behaviors of seeking support in real-life situations . We also have no information about whether the relatively low perception of available social support among insecure persons reflects their subjective experiences or the presence of objective , problematic social interactions . We also did not examine what it is that the three attachment types seek from supportive figures and how they feel about the types of support they receive . However , the data provided here may further contribute to the integration of two theoretical frameworks that emphasize the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted with gender as another independent variable . No significant association was found between the distribution of attachment style and gender , and no significant interaction was found between them in their effects on the perception and seeking of support . However , the analyses revealed the frequently found main effect of gender on social support ( Vaux , 1985 ) : Women perceived and searched for more emotional and instrumental support than men did .

##4000859 The Global Land Mine Plaque <p> As a little boy in the Gaza province of Mozambique , Luis dreamed of being famous . He wanted to be a soccer star , to see the world , and to help build the future of his beloved Mozambique , the pearl of the southern African nations . So each day he practiced and played , on and on into the dark hours of the early tropical night , until his mother would call him into their hut . His father had been a soccer player , and so had his three brothers , but none of them had ever become a star . But Luis was faster , stronger , and better at the game than all of them , so he had the right to dream his dreams . <p> Mozambique , in those days , was involved in an immensely cruel and seemingly endless war . As far back as Luis could remember , his country had been fighting : first against the Portuguese , then against the Rhodesians and the South Africans , and sometimes against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Some Mozambicans received weapons , supplies , and training from the Rhodesians and the South Africans . This group was called the Renamo , and it attacked government installations and communal settlements like the one in Gaza where Luis lived . <p> The fighters of the Renamo had a well-earned reputation for brutality and were considered by many Mozambicans to be little more than gangsters . They disrupted internal transportation systems . They blocked roads and railways , raided villages and set them on fire , and stole chickens and pigs . Often they raped and kidnapped children and taught them how to fight . Sometimes they even forced them to kill their own parents and made them drink their blood . The Renamo employed its terror tactics , which included both selective killing and wholesale slaughter , to frighten people away from supporting the government . In the process , it had created a massive refugee problem , perhaps the most serious one in the world . <p> " They were essentially bandits , " Luis now says reflectively . " They have been responsible for the depredations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the countryside . " <p> The Renamo fought the Frelimo , the armed forces of the government , whom Luis understood were no angels either-but maybe , just maybe , a little better than the Renamo . After all , the Frelimo was backed by the Russians ; they were socialists and that stood for more justice , more health care and education , and less difference between the classes . Or so they said . <p> Luis knew that in 1980 , when he joined the Frelimo , his dreams of becoming a soccer star were over . He knew this because the war ended most dreams . He was only 18 then . That was 16 years ago . <p> On his very first day with the Frelimo , Luis was put to work laying mines . He can not remember asking why he , a complete novice , should have been handling these deadly devices , nor what the military purpose was in laying them . Nor can he remember , 16 years later , exactly where he laid them or how many . He thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard tropical grass , they would be forgotten-at least until some Renamo fighter stepped on them . <p> And it certainly never occurred to him that those mines would still be in place , armed and deadly and waiting to explode , long after the fighting had ended . <p> In December 1990 , a peace treaty was signed between the Frelimo and the Renamo . It lasted a couple of days , and then the fighting resumed . This led to more negotiations and more fighting . In October 1992 , the Renamo finally agreed to recognize the Frelimo as the constitutional government ; in December 1992 , peace came to Mozambique . And it was eight months into the peace when Luis , now a civilian , went into the forest to chop wood and lost his leg to a land mine . <p> It happened on August 13 , 1993 , close to Provincial Road Number 10 , some 35 miles south of Maputo , the capital . Luis remembers the events of that day in vivid and horrific detail . He says it was near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with a friend to cut wood so that he could build his family a new home . He also needed wood so that Alda , his wife , could cook the family a meal . <p> Luis and his friend were wading through the shallow waters of a rice field when suddenly they heard a bang . At first , Luis did n't feel a thing ; he even remembers wondering , for a split second , if his friend had stepped on a mine . Then a gurgling sound came from the water . Luis looked down . The water was colored red . It was then he realized his left leg was n't there any more . <p> Luis almost lost consciousness ; his friend , panic stricken , turned and started to run , then realized what had happened and came to an abrupt halt . Thanks to his days in the army , Luis knew that he had to tie the stump off immediately in order to stem the bleeding . He ripped off a piece of his shirt and created a tour , niquet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Luis ' friend nearly an hour to work his way out of the minefield , using a stick to probe the ground ahead of him every step of the way . In that time , he came across a second mine -- a little Chinese T-72 , a plastic cylinder not much bigger than a man 's first , with thirty grams of explosives packed into a military-green casing to make it more difficult to detect in tropical-grass areas . ( Mozambicans call these mines frogs because of their color and the noise they make just before exploding . ) <p> Half an hour later , the friend returned with help from the village . It took them another 30 minutes to clear a path through the minefield and drag Luis ashore . Once they returned to the village , someone came up with the idea of going to Boane to get help . Boane was a three-hour walk -- but at least there was a car there , and the car could get Luis to an ambulance and the ambulance could take him to the Central Hospital in Maputo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis finally reached the medical facility . Within the hour , surgeons had amputated his left leg above the knee . Luis knew then that his life had changed forever . For one thing , he would never play soccer again . <p> Dr. Mack is a Red Cross surgeon who worked in Afghanistan and Rwanda before coming to Mozambique . He still remembers Luis very well . " One of his problems was that he had lost very much blood and an awful lot of mine mud had to be removed . We tried to save the right leg and had to clear all the affected spots . People who step on a mine lose one leg or foot at least , " he said , " but the mine mud very easily enters the other leg . That other leg has to be saved at all costs . If not , the victims are completely lost in a Third World country . " <p> Anti-personnel mines -- the kind of device that Luis lost his leg to -- generally do not kill more than 30 percent of their victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to inflict damage and to instill a sense of terror . " Strategically , the psychological effect of a mine is more efficient and important than removing a soldier from the battlefield , " says Tom Gowans , a mine-removal expert who works for Halo Trust in Quilimane , Mozambique . " A soldier who loses a foot or a leg or who suffers from severe internal bleeding has to be carried away by at least two other soldiers to receive medical care and attention . The rest of the soldiers are greatly affected in terms of morale . That is the perverse logic behind the use of mines . " <p> Halo Trust is a London-based humanitarian mine-clearance organization hired by the United Nations to conduct a nationwide assessment of Mozambique 's land-mine problem . The organization began working in early 1994 in the Maputo and Tete provinces . Six teams are being sent out with questionnaires to every district and municipality in an attempt to draw up a more scientific assessment of the worst areas for mines . This information is then put into a database and plotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Children , Doctors without Frontiers , and the Red Cross . <p> As I speak with Gowans , a call comes over his mobile receiver . A good 150 miles up the provincial road toward Cariwa , his people have found a group of villagers who know where some land mines are located . He invites me along to watch the removal . <p> The provincial road is in poor condition , and many bridges have been destroyed . Upon arriving at the village , I meet two members of Gowans ' team -- one from England and the other from New Zealand . The village itself is small and , in the days of the Portuguese , must have been very beautiful . There are six or seven colonial brick homes in which Ernest Hemingway would have felt right at home . The houses are all gutted now , with war slogans displayed along their walls : " Long live the revolution ! " " Socialism or death ! " " Welcome , Fidel ! " <p> The Brit comes out of his landrover carrying two maps of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is where a land mine is supposed to be . As he points its location out to us , I notice that the pinky and ring finger of his left hand are missing . " Mind you , " he says , " you are now in a minefield . " Two marked lanes some 300 feet long extend to the side of one of the houses . In a very carefully dug hole , I see a small , rusty , grenadelike bomb that must have been placed there during the war . The removal team gingerly attaches electric wires to it and , a few minutes later , my tape recorder registers the explosion . <p> About a hundred villagers sit and watch the operation from the porch of the only store in town . A limping man approaches us and cries out that he has served in the army all these years and has become no more than a disabled beggar . That is not what life had in mind when he was created , he says : " I gave my youth and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government just send me back to my mother ? She will take care of me . I just want to go home ! " <p> Gowans tries to explain that we are there only to remove the mines . The limping man insists that we must help , since the government does n't care . " You people have been sent to give aid to us , " he argues desperately , " to help us . If you do n't help , we have no one else to go to ! " <p> But there is nothing that any of us can do for him . <p> In the days of the civil war , Mozambique was a very poor country . It still is today . In fact , according to the World Bank , Mozambique is even poorer today than it was during the war years ; per capita income has actually fallen from $80 to $60 a year , making it the poorest nation on earth . And of every 1,000 children who are born in Mozambique , 300 die before they reach the age of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land mines got to a country like Mozambique in the first place , it is not enough to point an accusing finger at the Renamo or the Frelimo-or even at the First World corporations which turn a tidy profit from the manufacture and sale of these devices . For the story of land mines is also the story of human inventiveness , especially when it comes to dealing out death and destruction upon other members of our species . It is the dark , disturbing underside of our much-celebrated technological progress . <p> Although land mines are a creation of the twentieth century , some military historians credit the Romans with pioneering a primitive version of minefields , laying salt on the farm , lands of Carthage to prohibit their use for decades . ( The Romans also developed steel bullets which were fired from slingshots placed in front of the enemy 's horses . ) <p> It was n't until the First World War , however , that the German war industry developed the land mine as we now know it in order to stop the tanks of the Allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mines could also be used to sow death and terror among an advancing infantry led to the invention of the anti-personnel mine . <p> During World War II , an estimated 300 million anti-tank and anti-personnel mines were laid by the Axis and Allied powers combined . Today , a territory of some 500,000 square miles in northern Africa is still infested by mines left over from that war alone . In the 1960s , a new generation of mines was developed that could be laid in any chosen territory by " sowing " them from a plane or helicopter . Today , we have a third generation of " smart " mines , delivered by the hundreds from cannons , rockets , or aircraft , which are equipped with acoustic and infrared sensors and can arm and trigger themselves after having been instructed by a computer . <p> " In the old days , " says Andre Milloret , head of the United Nations Organization Mozambique in Maputo , " mines were laid to stop and divert the enemy . But with improving technology , manufacturers have stressed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is a horrible truth today : this new generation of land mines is able to ' look for ' its enemy and operate autonomously . " Milloret also observes that , in today 's wars , mines are not only being laid in battlefields but also around houses , churches , drinking wells , and even in schoolyards . <p> " It is appalling , " says Patrick Blagden , a British de-mining expert based in New York City . " It is utterly appalling what we are doing . Land mines are first produced against substantial costs , then sold and distributed ; then they lay there dormant until someone finally steps on them . It is a safe bet to say that , during the daylight hours of every day of every week of every month of every year , someone is maimed or killed by a land mine every 15 minutes . " ( For the record , the official figure , according to such organizations as the United Nations and the International Red Cross , is 2,000 victims every month . ) <p> Blagden himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1992 . He knows there are an estimated 110 million active land mines scattered throughout some 60 countries and at least 100 million more still in the planet 's arsenals . Many producer nations -- including Russia , Italy , Belgium , Portugal , Spain , Canada , and the United States -- will often throw in a shipment of land mines as a bonus when some Third World nation makes a hefty weapons purchase . <p> Blagden describes the use of land mines by these countries as a form of economic suicide . When you factor in the social and medical costs , the strain on already inadequate health-care systems , the loss of wage earners , and the inability to create revenue , either from agriculture or industry , because whole areas lie fallow once they are mined , the cost to these countries is enormous . <p> So , too , are the costs of removal . Blagden shows me a picture of his mine-removal team at work in a Cambodian rice field . Every single blade has to be cut by hand with a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip-wires attached to them . These are Valmara 69s from the Valsella Meccanotecnica factory in Italy , a so-called bounding fragmentation mine . Once the tripwire is snagged , the V-69 shoots into the air and explodes at waist level , riddling the immediate area -- and anyone in it-with shrapnel . The V-69s are " intelligent " because they can " communicate " with one another : a single trip-wire can set off a whole string of mines . <p> Only after the grass has been meticulously cut can the real business of mine removal begin . De-miners go in on their knees and prod the soil 400 times per square meter . Using a metal detector is pointless , because in many parts of the world the soil contains high grades of iron ore . Then , too , many current anti-personnel mines are made primarily of plastic , with metal parts too small to be recognized by conventional detectors . Blagden estimates that de-mining costs anywhere between $300 and $1,000 per mine . This is because , unlike laying the mines , which can be done by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , de-mining requires the services of professionals who have to be trained , equipped , and insured . They incur travel and living expenses and have to be provided with backup and support . <p> But some mines , like the Chinese 72-A , are made chiefly of fiberglass and cost no more than $3 apiece . " Now , who is willing to poke around 400 times per square meter just to find a $3 mine ? " Blagden wonders . Altogether , the total cost of removing the 110 million mines already in place could easily run into the hundreds of billions of dollars . No one knows how such a project could possibly be financed or even how long it would take -- to say nothing of having to spend such an appalling sum of money cleaning up the deadly relics of past wars when it could have been far better spent on education , health care , housing , and food . <p> In the African nation of Angola , 20 years of war have left behind over 15 million land mines -- at least one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one knows exactly how many mines are buried in Mozambique , but current estimates run as high as 10 million . " But is that really important to know ? " Luis asks bitterly . " Since I stepped on one and lost my left leg , I know there is one less . When my wife , Alda , stepped on another one a few months later , I knew there were two less . And when my youngest daughter was killed by a land mine , I knew there were three less . I lost my child , a leg , and so did my wife . Since I am impaired , I ca n't get a job . I wanted to play soccer , and now I ca n't even watch a game properly . War is shit . Land mines are shit . " <p> In April 1996 , representatives of more than 50 nations met in Geneva , Switzerland , to debate a ban on land mines as part of a periodic review of the 1980 U.N . Convention on Conventional Weapons . Anti-mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration into joining a group of 24 nations calling for an immediate ban on anti-personnel mines . They were joined in their efforts by the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation , which ran an ad in the New York Times demanding " Ban Land Mines Now . " And at least a dozen retired U.S. generals , including former Joint Chiefs of Staff chair David Jones , Desert Storm commander Norman Schwarzkopf , and former NATO commander John Galvin , signed an open letter to President Clinton urging their ban . <p> The results have not been encouraging . The Clinton administration chose not to press for a ban in Geneva , under the disingenuous claim that " we ca n't change our demands at the eleventh hour . " Instead , it offered a series of lukewarm amendments to the conventional-weapons accord : a requirement that anti-personnel mines be equipped to self-destruct after 30 days ; a prohibition of the sale of land mines to nations involved in civil war ; and ( perhaps most bizarre ) a rule that long , lived mines be used only in properly marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also proposed a series of stricter export controls , although , if recent history serves as any guide , this will be merely a paper deterrent . Late in 1991 , for example , four executives of Valsella Meccanotecnica were prosecuted for the illegal sale and delivery of nine million land mines to Iraq for a payment of $180 million . Valsella never had an export license ; an investigation showed that the order was shipped through a company in Singapore and that some of the land mines reached Mozambique . <p> The executives were found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Anton Foek <p> <p> Anton Foek is a freelance writer based in New York City . <p> 
##4000860 How Secret Military and Intelligence Appropriations Suck Up Your Tax Dollars <p> Corrupt and undemocratic conditions within the United States government were evident last fall when Congress siphoned a half-billion dollars from an illegal slush fund maintained by the secretive spy satellite agency , the National Reconnaissance Office , and used it to fund more B-2 " stealth " bombers . Northrup Grumman Corporation , a military contractor with a sordid and criminal background , secured the money for more B-2 bombers on December 1 , 1995 , when the 1996 defense appropriations bill became law . The half-billion dollars appropriated for the B-2 is merely a down payment on 20 more planes , which will cost over $31 billion if completed . <p> Congress has forced the bombers on the military over the Objections of the Pentagon , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the Air Force . In a May 1995 study commissioned by Congress , the Institute for Defense Analysis concluded that , with the demise of the Soviet Union , there was no need for more B-2s . Nonetheless , Northrop Grumman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAC contributions from the B-2 's corporate beneficiaries , shrewdly disclosed the existence of the NRO slush fund just as they were completing their final maneuvers to fund the B-2 . They then applied over $1 billion of the slush fund-estimated at a total of $2 billion-to the B-2 and other unpopular weapons programs . If , as President Dwight D. Eisenhower once declared , " Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed , " then Northrop Grumman has surely robbed the American public . Shamefully , President Clinton allowed the appropriations bill to become law . Most disturbing of all , the excesses involved in funding the B-2 and the National Reconnaissance Office are not isolated incidences but , instead , are typical of the practices used in dozens of weapons and intelligence program involving as much as $125 billion annually . CIA Director Investigates Himself <p> On September 24 , 1995 , the Washington Post reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 billion without informing its superiors at the Pentagon and CLA or its overseers in Congress . " White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta later confirmed the report , claiming that the money was " inexcusably hoarded " and that CIA Director John Deutch had ordered an investigation . Deutch also allegedly ordered " a restructuring of the NRO 's financial management and a complete review of its spending " in response to the news . Curiously , prior to taking charge at the ClA in May 1995 , Deutch oversaw military intelligence , including the NRO , in his capacity as Deputy Secretary of Defense . ( The government officially admitted the existence of the NRO in 1992 , although its budget and specific functions remain classified . The NRO 's fleet of costly satellites gathers photographs and signals for electronic eavesdropping on behalf of the CIA and military intelligence agencies . ) As deputy secretary of defense , Deutch was second in command at the Pentagon , as well as the chair of the NRO 's executive committee , which makes all critical decisions at the NRO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security clearance at the Pentagon , either knew of the slush fund or chose to remain ignorant . Defense News , a widely read military journal , recently called for the dismissal of those responsible for what it referred to as the NRO 's " funding debacle . " As there is no adequate explanation why Deutch remained ignorant of a hoard placed at over 20 percent of the NRO 's $7 billion annual budget , he , too , should be dismissed . Climate of Secrecy Fosters Waste and Unaccountability <p> The NRO , a bottomless pit into which Congress pours money , can squander hundreds of millions of dollars and still remain awash in money . In 1994 , the NRO was found to have secretly and illegally spent $300 million on an office complex in Fairfax County , Virginia . The complex , which contains 30 percent more office space than is needed by the agency , was built in collusion with Rockwell International Corporation . ( Rockwell itself is a giant military contractor whose projects include manufacturing components for hydrogen bombs as well as the B-2 bomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge complex was not an NRO project , millions of dollars in local property taxes-normally not paid by the federal government-were footed by taxpayers . Rockwell lied to local officials , telling them that the NRO complex was a Rockwell facility . <p> The secrecy surrounding the NRO and the absence of any meaningful oversight enabled the agency to obtain appropriations for operating expenses that were hundreds of millions of dollars in excess of its genuine needs . The excess funds were then channeled into a secret slush fund . Although Congress never appropriated the money for the complex , the NRO nonetheless spent $300 million , violating ARTICLE I of the U.S. Constitution , which stipulates : " No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . " <p> The NRO 's corrupt practices have been evident for over a decade . In his 1986 book Deep Black : Space Espionage and National Security , scholar and journalist William E.

As early as 1990 , systems engineer Marty Overbleck-Bloem , an ex-employee of Lockheed Missile and Space Company , builder of billion dollar NRO satellites , blew the whistle on the NRO . Quoted in Tim Weiner 's book Blank Check : The Pentagon 's Black Budget , Overbleck-Bloem said : <p> In a black project , people do n't worry about money . If you need money , you got it . If you screw up and need more , you got it . You 're just pouting money into the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to do it right the first time . Who 's going to question it ? Secrecy Violates Constitution and Undermines Democracy <p> The NRO 's functions have been classified and its secret budget unconstitutionally concealed since its creation in 1960 . ARTICLE I , SECTION 9 , CLAUSE 7 of the United States Constitution requires the government to publish a " regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money . " While the treasurer publishes an official budget annually , at least $28 billion in " classified " intelligence appropriations and billions more for secret weapons programs are falsely identified as belonging to other agencies , rendering the official budget a mere sham . <p> In the case of United States v. Richardson , decided in 1974 , the Supreme Court refused to enforce the receipts and expenditures clause of the Constitution . In Richardson , a citizen brought suit to require the U.S. treasurer to disclose the budget for the CIA as required by the Constitution . The Supreme Court ruled that citizen taxpayers have no standing to enforce this provision of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's secrecy . If citizens do n't like the government 's violation of the Constitution , their only remedy is what the Court described as " the slow , cumbersome , and unresponsive " electoral process . To allow citizen taxpayers to challenge the government 's unconstitutional practice of failing to fully account for its receipts and expenditures , wrote Chief Justice Warren Burger , " would mean that the Founding Fathers intended to set up something in the nature of an Athenian democracy . . . to oversee the conduct of the National Government . " Burger 's candid contempt for democratic ideals and his related promotion of government secrecy reflects the prevailing views of U.S. governing elites at least since World War II . <p> The world 's most exclusive millionaire 's club-the United States Senate-has continuously maintained the secret government while acknowledging its unconstitutionality . In 1976 , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence recognized that classification of intelligence budgets causes " members of the public to be deceived " and " violates ARTICLE 1 , SECTION 9 , CLAUSE 7 of the Constitution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget spending since 1976 . The budget of the NRO was $3.5 billion ( in 1994 dollars ) in 1980 , half of its current level . Keeping current spending levels secret-and suppressing domestic oversight along the way-remains a priority for the military intelligence community and its corporate allies . As journalist John Pike observed in the fall 1994 issue of Covert Action Quarterly , excessive public discussion could promote the idea that " much of the intelligence budget funds expensive satellites " which have been " rendered obsolete by the demise of their primary target , the Soviet Union . " B-2 Bomber : Created in Secrecy , Sustained by PACs <p> Like the NRO , the B-2 bomber has long been a classified project . An estimated $23 billion was spent for research and development on the B-2 during the 1980s , though everything about the B-2 budget was classified until June 1989 , six months after the first bomber was unveiled . Northrop Grumman initially placed the final cost of the B-2 at $550 million per plane , which made it the most expensive airplane in history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per plane -- four times Northrop 's estimate . This did n't stop Northrop Grumman from claiming , as part of its lobbying effort in 1995 , that the next 20 bombers could be produced for only $570 million each . Later that spring , the Pentagon released its own figures , placing the cost at more than $1.5 billion per plane . <p> Senator Ted Stevens ( Republican-Alaska ) and Representative Norman Dicks ( Democrat-Washington ) were key players in identifying-or possible creating-the NRO hoard and then transferring these funds to the B-2 . Both men had been groomed for years with huge PAC contributions from B-2 contractors , including Northrop Grumman . According to Nancy Walzman and Sheila Crumholz in The Best Defense : Will Campaign Contributions Protect the Industry ? ( published by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics ) , Dicks raked in over $10,000 from nine major B-2 contractors in four months ' time , making him one of the largest House recipients of military PAC money just as the B-2 battle was heating up . Five thousand dollars of this money came from Northrop Grumman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles and Palm Springs on a promotional tour . During the 1993-1994 period , Walzman and Crumholz disclose , Dicks was a " top recipient of B-2 contractors ' PAC money , " receiving $23,000 from Northrop , Boeing , Lockheed , Vought Aircraft , and other B-2 contractors . However , B-2 contractors were not the only ones who rewarded Dicks ; military PACs paid him at least $96,500 in the 1993-1994 period alone . <p> As for Senator Stevens , the Center for Responsive Politics found that , from 1989 to 1994 , seven major B-2 contractors-Northrop Grumman , General Electric , Boeing , Hughes Air , craft , Loral , Vought Aircraft , and LTV Aerospace and Defense -made PAC contributions to his office of at least $37,000 . This makes him one of the top ten recipients of PAC money from B-2 contractors in the history of the United States . Stevens also tops the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with $207,000 in military corporate PAC contributions from 1989 to 1994 , ranking him as the second , highest recipient of military corporate PAC contributions in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key supporters of the B-2 . In the House , the bipartisan coalition of Republican representatives Duncan Hunter ( California ) , Floyd Spence ( South Carolina ) , and Buck McKeon ( California ) and Democrats Norman Dicks ( Washington ) and Ike Skelton ( Missouri ) reaped huge rewards . The CRFP conservatively estimated that members of Senate and House defense appropriations committees received over $8.5 million of military-related PAC and " individual " contributions in the 1993-1994 period . The rate of giving by B-2 contractors ' PACS dramatically increased in 1995 . <p> The defense contractors ' practice of rewarding their supporters with PAC contributions has been described by some as legalized bribery . While this analysis is accurate in many instances , it ignores other important institutional factors . Many recipients of military corporate PAC money would be inclined to support outlandish expenditures on the B-2 and other programs regardless of whether or not they received PAC contributions . Many B-2 advocates in Congress are retired military men . For example , Representative Hunter of San Diego , a long.time B-2 supporter , was an Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't necessarily buy loyalty ; it simply ensures that loyal supporters of the military-industrial complex will remain in office . Defense analyst Stephen Shalom has accurately described this effect in The V-22 Osprey and the Post-Cold War Military Budget : <p> If politicians with the " right " views get the funds they need to secure and retain office while those with the " wrong " views do not , then officeholders will tend to have the right views . The politicians may not be for sale , but the offices are . <p> Military , congressional , and corporate backing for the B-2 bomber has been assured by spreading subcontracts for it throughout at least 383 congressional districts in 48 states . Thousands of subcontractors and their suppliers benefit from B-2 production , and they have inundated pliable legislators with individual campaign contributions in addition to PAC money . Contributions from officers , directors , managers , and employees of these corporations , made in their " individual " capacity , do not fall within the limits placed on corporate PAC contributions . The senators and representatives nonetheless know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bundling , " in which several checks for up to $1,000 from managers , employees , and family members of contractors known to the legislators are given simultaneously . Illegal Practices Widespread <p> Although the payment of individual and PAC contributions is usually legal , the effects of illegal payments and practices -- including outright bribery -- should not be discounted . Key defense contractors , including Boeing and Lockheed , have been convicted of paying millions of dollars in bribes to obtain top-secret Pentagon planning papers , while Rockwell International was convicted of and fined $5.5 million for criminal fraud against the Air Force in connection with an NRO satellite project . <p> Likewise , illegally squeezing vendors and employees for PAC contributions is a skill at which Northrop Grumman should excel . The company was formed a year and a half ago with the merger of two corporate outlaws -- Northrop Corporation and Grumman Corporation . The former president of Grumman , John O'Brien , was recently convicted of fraud related to loans he received from James Kane , the former head of Long Island Aerospace PAC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recent book , When the Pentagon Was for Sale , O'Brien and Kane specialized in shaking down Grumman 's vendors and employees : " Employees who aggressively raised campaign loot were rewarded with promotions and bonuses . Conversely , O'Brien threatened to fire or demote workers who were less wholehearted in aiding Kane . " Recalcitrant suppliers , such as Monitor Aerospace , which was reluctant to contribute to Grumman 's lobbying program , soon found that Grumman was doing its buying elsewhere -- a violation of federal law . Ultimately , Grumman paid the government $20 million to escape further criminal and civil liability . <p> Northrop 's criminal convictions reach back to 1972 , when it was convicted of maintaining a slush fund which was used to buy the silence of the Watergate burglars . More recently , it was convicted in 1990 of charges related to its intentional falsification of tests concerning nuclear cruise missiles and fighter jets , for which the company paid a $17 million fine . Raw Power Maintains High Spending Levels <p> By the raw power of money , the coalition of military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending for Cold War weaponry such as the B-2 while programs for low birth-weight babies , childhood immunizations , scholarship assistance , Medicaid , and Medicare are slashed . <p> Even the U.S. government 's official propaganda does n't suggest that these levels of spending are required because of threats from China or Russia . While the United States spent about $285 billion on the military in 1994 , Russia spent less than $80 billion , and China spent only $27 billion . Given this lack of military threats , the U.S. Defense Department was forced to stretch the truth in its 1995 annual report , which sought to justify current spending levels . According to the Secretary of Defense , the threats to be guarded against are " hostile regional powers , " the acquisition by " potential adversaries " of " weapons of mass destruction , " " terrorism , " ' and " the illegal drug trade . " Since none of these so-called threats is either new or sufficient to justify such extraordinary spending levels , the government has resorted to sophistry , arguing that the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight two major wars simultaneously anywhere in the world without allied assistance while remaining capable of defending the mainland from nuclear and conventional attack . In other words , the military must be ready to fight World War III at all times . Promising Signs for Democracy <p> The currently prevailing regime of subsidies to the military while domestic programs are cut is a direct challenge to the legitimate democratic expectations of the American people . In peacetime , democratic principles require that social and economic needs should take priority over military programs . Events within the military , Congress , the mass media , and religious and peace groups suggest that a grassroots movement is forming to resist the military-corporate challenge to democracy . <p> One promising development was the formation of a consortium of public-policy organizations in 1994 , the Military Spending Working Group , to coordinate the activities of peace and security organizations in the pursuit of a peace dividend . One member organization of the MSWG is the Center for Defense Information , which is directed by retired high-ranking military officers ; it has been scathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military spending " given the greatly diminished military dangers that confront America . " <p> Another promising development is the emergence of a split within the Republican Party , where significant divisions have developed between traditional " hawks " and " cheap hawks , " who claim to be willing to reduce deficits by cutting military spending . Major newspapers such as the Boston Globe have inveighed against current military spending levels , and national magazines like the Nation , the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , the Progressive , Z , and the National Times have all published commentary criticizing the lack of a peace dividend . <p> Religious groups have also objected to the degree of militarism and have engaged in inspiring acts of civil disobedience challenging ongoing nuclear weapons deployment . On August 7 , 1995 , on the fiftieth anniversaries of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , six Catholic activists calling them , selves Jubilee Plowshares entered weapons facilities on both coasts , hammering and pouring blood on nuclear weaponry and suffering criminal prosecution . One of the activists , Susan Crane , later wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand these weapons are a direct theft from the poor of the world who need food , shelter , medical care , and jobs . " <p> Such efforts to publicize nuclear threats are particularly important because the high costs and risks presently posed by nuclear weapons remains a mystery to most Americans . According to John Lehman , former Secretary of the Navy , the costs of strategic nuclear weapons alone are about $70 billion per year . Given the United States ' historical position as the only remaining superpower , the compelling moral grounds to curtail military spending , and the broad . based protest activity which is occurring , the seeds for a democratic resistance movement are present . <p> As long as the public remains unorganized and tolerant of the status quo , the military-corporate alliance will dictate a level of military spending which keeps its coffers filled to overflowing . Since at least World War II , this alliance has been the dominant force in the U.S. economy . It is not going to cede power simply because the prior justifications for its dominance -- World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War -- have ended . Instead , as President Eisenhower warned in his farewell address 36 years ago , it will invent new reasons and create new conflicts in order to justify its existence . <p> By J.

##4000861 Most of us strongly object to the idea , raised from time to time , that we do n't have free will . Such a suggestion seems almost unthinkable , or needlessly pessimistic , and we ordinarily reject it out of hand . After all , not having free will seems to threaten the very foundations of moral judgment and contradicts the undeniable feeling that our future is open to us . Most of us suppose , rather , that if the tape of history were replayed , we could have done otherwise in virtually all situations . Even if every fact coming to bear at a given time -- even our own motives and desires -- were the same , we could have made a different choice . <p> The essential " I " rules , shaping behavior in a way that ca n't be fully accounted for by our genetic inheritance , our life history , or our immediate circumstances . We want to believe that in some essential respect the self stands outside of nature and culture , bearing originative responsibility for its acts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditworthy self . <p> On the other hand , we very much like to explain things -- in particular , what makes us tick . We want to know how the human body works , what causes mental illness , what lies behind crime and deviance , what determines sexual preference , what accounts for addiction , obesity , poverty , creativity , religious fanaticism , and so forth . In short , there is nothing in human behavior that is n't , in this scientific age , being exhaustively scrutinized from a causal perspective . The interacting effects of biology and society on the individual are enumerated , classified , and built into theories and useful rules of thumb , and generally we congratulate ourselves at our success in discovering the springs of action . <p> Could there be , perhaps , just the slightest tension between these two predilections ? We really ca n't have it both ways , after all . We ca n't , for instance , conduct a serious investigation of what caused Susan Smith to let her car slide down the ramp into a South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that the act must be finally attributable to her own free will . To believe the latter is to render a causal explanation of her crime superfluous , since no matter what her physical and psychological conditions were at the time she could have done otherwise . On the other hand , to believe that Susan Smith did not have free will seems to undercut the requirements of justice . If she was not raving mad ( and it seems likely she was not ) , then a complete explanation of her act that omits mention of free will seems to exonerate her . No wonder , then , that the conflict between scientific explanation and our cherished exemption from natural causality is so rarely made explicit , and no wonder it is so often the subtext of our debates about responsibility . <p> It is also the source of a good deal of political disagreement . Liberals are fond of pointing to the social and economic causes of crime , addiction , and poverty , while conservatives are more likely to hold , as Justice Clarence Thomas put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuses " for failings that derive essentially from free personal choices . The liberal interest in rehabilitation and the conservative penchant for punishment are closely linked to these opposing stances -- one of which understands the individual as the potentially malleable product of outside factors , while the other insists that persons , at bottom , are self-made , hence deserving of just rewards and punishments . <p> Of course , this distinction is not quite so clean . For example , many liberals wince at the biological determinism of The Bell Curve , and conservatives often justify welfare reform on the grounds that behavior is indeed responsive to external , government-controlled incentives . Hardly anyone -- yet -- is the sort of pure , hard determinist who gladly bites the bullet of causal explanation , and no one , however insistent about the existence of free will , denies the obvious : that behavior is at least partially a function of social and biological conditions . Nevertheless , in our debates about human nature and behavior , the opposition between causality and freedom is often the forensic fulcrum . Attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mentally ill , homosexuals , the obese , as well as criminals , are frequently conditioned by the underlying supposition that the ultimate cause of someone 's problem or status lies in his or her choice , finally , to be that way . It is time to begin the public , explicit questioning of this assumption , however uncomfortable it may occasionally make us . Only by doing so are we likely to come to grips with the basic structure of our disagreements . <p> This questioning , in fact , is well under way but not yet very public or explicit . The academic philosophical debate about free will has , of course , continued on in articles and books too technical for most readers . And most would suppose that such hermetic discourse has little to offer the wider world in all its messy practicalities . But it is not that philosophical investigations into the concept of free will are inapplicable to everyday life -- many such investigations have explored real world consequences -- but , rather , that the conclusions reached , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will : the belief that we are , in some important sense , the uncaused originators of our acts . The vast majority of modern philosophers dismiss this notion as incoherent and take the position that free will consists simply in being able to act , without hindrance , on one 's desires and motives . And desires and motives , like everything else in the world , have causes . <p> This so-called compatibilist view , in which free will is compatible with determinism , is a far cry from the idea of our being uncaused originators . It is not , to put it mildly , what most people suppose they possess -- or what they suppose we must possess -- in order to be moral agents deserving of praise and blame . We do not want to be told that our free will is just a matter of negative freedom -- the freedom from constraint . We like to believe , rather , in the radical , positive , libertarian freedom that permits the self to determine behavior without the self being completely determined . Only such freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deserve approval and censure , reward and punishment . It is no surprise , therefore , that philosophers find their investigations and conclusions widely ignored . The compatibilist version of free will is simply not the sort of free will most of us imagine we have , and we do n't much appreciate having our cherished notion of human causal privilege denied . Most folks outside the academy are incompatibilists , seeing a basic contradiction between determinism and moral responsibility . <p> This no doubt explains why explicit challenges to free will in the popular media are few and far between . Since so much seems to depend on having it , why rock the boat ? Yet some challenges have been mounted , most recently and notably by Robert Wright in his book The Moral Animal . In a chapter entitled " Blaming the Victim , " Wright pulls no punches , showing how the increasing success of scientific explanation must shrink the domain of libertarian freedom to the point where we might as well admit that " we are all machines , pushed and pulled by forces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Cotton , writing about free will in the March 1993 Journal of the American Medical Association , also worries that " science may be on a collision course with one of society 's most cherished beliefs . " Leaving aside the question of whether , if determinism is true , it is useful or apt to describe ourselves as machines , Wright 's conclusion about free will -- that it is simply a delusion without intelligible foundation -- is not a little disquieting and , perhaps for this reason , has been passed over in reviews of his book . <p> After all , is n't it simply crazy to suppose that , first , we really do n't have free will and , second , that society could get along without it ? Is n't our intuition that usually we could have done otherwise indisputable , and would n't it obviously invite havoc into our lives if it were shown that people , in fact , are not originatively responsible for their behavior ? Given the apparently dire consequences of challenging the existence of free will , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , in fact , it is n't crazy to suppose we do n't have the libertarian sort of freedom : indeed , most academic philosophers believe precisely that , our intuitions notwithstanding . Nor is it unimaginable that society could function successfully in the absence of this assumption , since these same philosophers , along with Wright , have argued that our personal and social good can emerge unscathed in a fully deterministic world . Given that this ground has been broken but not yet made particularly visible , the next step is to legitimize a vigorous public debate on free will . Those who question it are not totally off their rockers , nor do they threaten everything we hold near and dear . They may , in fact , offer the best hope for achieving a less punitive society -- if we can suppress the affront to our dignity long enough to give them a fair hearing . <p> The Susan Smith case is a good place to start reconsidering free will , since the commission of the crime was never in question -- only why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Smith have done other than what she did that night , or was her act simply part of an ineluctable train of events ? The case illustrates the tension between the desire to blame and the desire to explain and shows how the retributive impulse , always linked to the assumption of free will , fades when a causal explanation of a crime is forthcoming . A report on the trial by Rick Bragg in the July 9 , 1995 , New York Times captured the polarity nicely in the first two sentences : <p> Her lawyers are expected to argue that Susan Smith has been the victim of destructive relationships and influences since she was born , swept helplessly through life like a cork down a quick-moving creek . <p> The prosecution is expected to paint her as a scheming monster who lied to her hometown and the entire world for nine days , blaming a phantom carjacker for the disappearance of her sons before confessing that she had drowned the two little boys in a dark lake . <p> After Smith 's confession , sentiment in the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " view of Smith held sway immediately following the revelation that she had concocted , out of whole cloth , the story of her children 's abduction by a black carjacker . What could be a better sign of a deliberate , freely willed crime than the fabrication of an alibi , maintained as a bare-faced lie for nine days under intense national attention ? If anyone deserved the death penalty sought by the prosecution , it seemed Susan Smith did . But as time went on and the details of her life became public , perceptions changed . It turned out that the " scheming monster " had an early history of depression and mental instability , well hidden behind a facade of cheerful normality . Her biological father had committed suicide shortly after her sixth birthday , and she later suffered sexual abuse at the hands of her stepfather . Onlookers began to consider that perhaps Susan Smith had not created herself out of whole cloth , that perhaps her state of mind at the time of the murders was the fatal culmination of a life history and recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations , not unexpectedly , began to soften support for the death penalty . After all , when we start to understand the causal history of a person 's behavior , we ordinarily tend to blame that person less and our desire for retribution abates . This is so because one sort of explanation -- the explanation involving an autonomous , freely willing agent deserving of retributive justice -- is supplanted by another : that of antecedent causes and influences . Retributive rage is fueled by our belief that an autonomous agent-self is in control , and when the existence or capacities of the agent are called into question -- as they were in Susan Smith 's case and in other " abuse excuse " cases such as the Bobbitt and Menendez trials -- the rage diminishes . <p> The defense could not argue that no such agent existed in Susan Smith , for that would have gone far beyond the pale of judicial precedent , even though science supports such a view . Rather , it had to play by the current rules of the game and try to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect -- an argument made marginally plausible by her history of abuse . The bone of contention between defense and prosecution was thus the state of the presumptively autonomous self . Was the potential for freely willed choice present or not ? Did Susan Smith have , in legal parlance , the " capacity to conform her conduct to the law " or , even though she undoubtedly appreciated the wrongfulness of her act , was she in the grip of an " irresistible impulse " ? The outcome of the trial would hinge on the extent to which the jury bought the defense 's argument that the forces of her remote and recent history overrode the assumed ability to freely choose right over wrong . <p> Under the rules of the game -- that is , under the presumption of free will -- the prosecution 's case looked far stronger , since unless the defense could prove a substantial mental defect ( which a history of depression and abuse does not necessitate ) , the jury might well have imposed the death penalty . The prosecution had merely to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , that she freely selected her actions in the service of depraved motives . Since she chose to kill , she deserved to die . <p> But why , some pesky philosophers and scientists ( or any inquiring mind ) might have asked , did the freely willing Susan Smith choose to kill ? If she was not compelled by circumstances to this heinous deed , why did n't she choose otherwise ? Had the prosecution been forced to answer such questions , it could not , of course , have cited any influences on her ( that is in the defense 's interest , after all , since it tends to exonerate ) . Instead , it could only have cited her motives -- for instance , the self-aggrandizing desire to promote an affair with her wealthy employer 's son . But even then the assumption about free will is that even a motive or impulse is not sufficient cause for an act , since the agent could have chosen to ignore its prompting . So again , the question repeats : why did n't Susan Smith decide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially considering the means she hit upon ? <p> At this point , the prosecution would have had little to say , except that Susan Smith out of her own free will simply chose not to ignore it . ( Again , the prosecution could n't say the desire was overpowering , since that would suggest she was incapacitated by an irresistible impulse ) . Finally , it turns out , there is no plausible explanation for what she did in terms of influences , factors , motives , or desires consistent with free will and , thus , with our traditional notion of responsibility . <p> A related , equally vacuous reply the prosecution might have offered is that Susan Smith is simply a monster , someone who decided naturally and dispassionately to sacrifice her children . Since , under a corollary of the free-will assumption , we are all responsible for our characters , Susan Smith could have chosen ( years ago , perhaps ) to become a very different sort of person , someone who would have resisted the impulse to kill . Since she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimately , we ask again : what led her to choose to become such a distasteful character ? Well , she just chose to become that person , comes the answer . And on such an answer rests the traditional determination of criminal and moral responsibility . <p> It is embarrassing , to say the least , that proof of criminal guilt depends on blocking plausible explanations of both behavior and character , but this , in fact , is what the law requires . For it is widely reported that , once we allow a person 's actions or character to be explained in terms of cause and effect , the primary basis for personal responsibility -- the freely willed choice -- evaporates . Unless the agent somehow acted on its own ( or created itself ) in some important respect independently of influences and circumstances , we forfeit the fundamental retributive justification for punishment . The prosecution therefore wanted the jury to believe that the essential Susan Smith -- the self/agent/controller pulling her own strings -- deserved capital punishment for an act that she alone originated . <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerting an influence but itself in some essential respect uninfluenced -- is an impossibility . The causal continuum -- whether physical , biological , psychological , or social -- leaves no gaps in which such agents can reside . Locating a distinct entity in space and time guarantees that it will be causally connected to the world around it . The motto for science might be " No one gets to cause without being caused in turn " or perhaps " You ca n't have your causal cake and eat it too . " On the other hand , if science proved that some of our behavior was essentially indeterminately or randomly generated , it 's hard to see how that could serve as the basis for ascribing behavior to an intentional agent . Neither causality nor a causality , therefore , support the com-mon-sense notion of free will . <p> So much the worse for science , some might say . If the traditional concept of responsibility , both moral and criminal , requires free will , then science is obviously out of order in its critique of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of our moral concept but our common-sense notion of explanation itself . When we ask why a person has committed a particular action , we are n't necessarily asking for anything terribly technical . We just want to place the act into a context which makes it understandable and perhaps predictable next time around . To have put the prosecution on the spot by asking why Susan Smith killed her children would n't have been scientism but , rather , only healthy inquisitiveness . The answers " because she simply chose to do it out of her own free will " or " because she 's a monster " seem patent evasions since we can still reasonably want more of an explanation . On the other hand , the defense 's answer -- that a history of depression and abuse led to a tortured and confused mental state -- may or may not be true , but at least this attempts to actually account for her behavior . If we believe Susan Smith acted coldly and rationally out of selfish motives , so be it ; but we need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- buy the notion that she chose to act out of some mysterious , uncaused capacity called free will . <p> All this does not mean , however , that Susan Smith ( or Lorena Bobbitt or the Menendez brothers ) should have been acquitted . Even if a plausible explanation of her crime rules out the freely willing agent and so undercuts the justification for retributive punishment , there are nevertheless other very good reasons to detain her . Had she been judged insane ( always unlikely given her calculated lies ) , then treatment in a secure facility would have been appropriate . Since she was judged sane , it is obviously important to protect ourselves , as well as deter others harboring similar motives , by imprisoning her . Time spent in the right sort of facility , with the right sort of interventions , might even work to ameliorate a flawed character . But the primary rationale for imposing capital punishment -- that by freely choosing to commit murder Susan Smith deserved to die -- has no force if we dispense with free will . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , bears this out . The good citizens of that town ( and the jurors who decided Smith 's fate ) quite properly sensed -- perhaps unconsciously -- that you ca n't put her crime into a causal , explanatory context and still justify retributive punishment . <p> But are feelings of rage against a murderer and the wish for retribution never justified ? If Susan Smith killed her children simply in order to advance an affair , are we wrong to condemn her ? Obviously we are not wrong to condemn the act , whatever its causes , and it 's hard to resist the initial , angry surge of desire to impose comparable sufferings upon the perpetrator . As Robert Wright points out in The Moral Animal , such feelings are simply the naturally evolved response to a horrific violation of a central human value . They serve to ensure that such transgressions are swiftly attended to , for if reliable sanctions were not imposed , no ordered society could last for long . But whether or not we should freely indulge the retributive impulse , given what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much an open question . <p> That impulse , science has shown us , is emphatically not justified by the existence of a freely willing agent who deserves condemnation for having autonomously originated the act . No such agents exist anywhere -- or ever have or ever could -- since humans are as much a part of the causal continuum as molecules and machines . And even if human behavior were partially attributable to some random element , that would do nothing to endow us with originative agenthood . Therefore we must , as Wright suggests , learn to accommodate ourselves to the fact that our rage at the " scheming monster " has no metaphysical justification in free will . The desire for retribution points us in the right direction , perhaps , but we need not follow that bitter path to the end . <p> Our concept of moral responsibility need not rest on the myth of originative agency but only on the necessity for social order . We must assign credit and blame and impose legal and moral sanctions not because freely willing agents exist but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this realization sinks in , the desire to inflict comparable suffering on those proven guilty may lessen , and our attention might shift from punishment to prevention , from retribution to rehabilitation . To explain is not necessarily to excuse , but explanations can help considerably in moving us away from anger toward a more constructive response to crime and deviance . <p> By Thomas W.

##4001377 The current study examined differential patterns of interrelationships between meditators and nonmeditators on issues pertaining to psychosocial adaptation . Subjects ( N = 66 ) were randomly selected from mailing lists provided by the Association of Transpersonal Psychology or were solicited via classified advertising in the Chicago Tribune and the Dallas Morning News . The findings of the current study indicate that there are no differences between meditators and nonmeditators on level of psychosocial adaptation . However examination of the zero-order correlations between dependent measures revealed differential patterns of interrelationships within the meditator and nonmeditator groups . The findings suggest that further research is needed which expands upon the influence of meditation on psychosocial adaptation by addressing topics specific to meditative practice . The implications for the development of qualitative research methods designed to investigate psychosocial parameters in transpersonal psychology are discussed . INTRODUCTION <p> Previous literature in transpersonal psychology with the focus on meditation has generally examined the influence of meditative techniques by comparing differences between meditators and nonmeditators . Most recently , investigators have examined the influence of meditation on counseling/therapy outcome , personality development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document the positive influence of meditation on stress reduction ( e.g. Humphrey , 1993 ; Janowiak , 1993 ; Sethi , 1990 Beauchamp-Turner &; Levinson 1992 ) ; while others have discussed reduction of anxiety through meditation ( e.g. , Castillo , 1990 ; Abrams &; Siegel , 1978 ; Beauchamp-Turner &; Levinson , 1992 ; Alexander , et al. , 1993 ; Pearl &; Carlozzi , 1994 ; Snaith , Owens , &; Kennedy , 1992 ) . Further , researchers have suggested that meditation may be beneficial in alleviating both hostility and depression . Regarding the efficacy of various meditation techniques , the positive effects of transcendental meditation ( TM ) have been documented in virtually every area of traditional meditation research ( Staggers , Alexander &; Walton , 1994 ; Fergusson , Bonshek &; Boudigues , 1994 ; Lasalle &; Russell , 1993 ; Cranson , et al. , 1991 ) . Investigations without a nonmeditator comparison group have primarily focused on the influence of meditation on development of consciousness and altered states of consciousness ( e.g. , Comptom , 1991 ) . Shapiro 's work ( 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet generated a significant change in the type of meditation studies published . <p> The current study sought to examine differential patterns of interrelationships between meditators and nonmeditators on issues pertaining to psychosocial adaptation . Specifically , the current study compares meditators and nonmeditators on level of psychological distress , gender stereotyping , and dogmatism . Several assumptions about the relationship between psychological distress , dogmatism and gender stereotyping formed the initial basis for the selection of these three variables . Previous research suggests that psychosocial real adaptation occurs as a function of a restricted range of viewing others , dogmatism and personal rigidity ( Millon , 1990 ) . Dogmatism has been shown to be related to racism , sexism , antiegalitarianism , and authoritarianism ( Raden , 1994 ; Sidanius , 1993 ) . Also , persons high in dogmatism have shown greater belief persistence even with evidence that contradicts their original assumptions ( Davies , 1993 ) ; exhibited more polarized attitudes ( Leone , 1989 ) ; and exhibited lower self esteem ( Fernandez , 1990 ) . <p> Previous literature has suggested that self actualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to Maslow ( 1972 ) , self-actualized persons are involved in life beyond simplistic dichotomies and allow a holistic experience of self and others . Further , they choose growth over stagnation and new insight over confirmation of the status quo . Thus , individuals who are more self-actualized would typically exhibit less dogmatism , gender stereotyping , or psychological distress ( Sakairi , 1991 ) . For the purpose of this study it was assumed that meditators as a group differ from non-meditators in the degree of self-actualization , and consequently would report lower levels of psychological distress , dogmatism , and gender stereotyping . METHODS Participants <p> Participants included 33 meditators ( 9 males , 23 females , 1 no response ) and 33 non-meditators ( 9 males , 24 females ) . No significant differences were revealed between meditators and non-meditators for age , M = 43.8 ( SD = 11.9 ) and M = 34.8 ( SD = 10.8 ) , respectively ( p > .05 ) . The total sample was primarily Caucasian ( 86.4% , n = 57 ) ; 34.8% ( n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n = 20 ) single , and 18.2% ( n= 12 ) divorced . No differences were found between groups for ethnicity chi 2 ( 3 , N = 64 ) = 2.29 , p > .05 or marital status chi 2 ( 5 , N = 64 ) = 8.37 , p > .05 No differences were found between groups for income , averaging $24,000 annually , chi 2 ( 7 , N = 64 ) = 13.21 ( p > .05 ) . <p> Concentrative and insight/mindfulness were the most prevalent forms of meditation , with 79% ( n = 26 ) utilizing one or both forms . However 21.2% ( n = 7 ) responded " other " ( e.g. , Tai Chi ) . The most common influences to begin meditating were personal experiences ( 39.4% , n = 13 ) and another meditator ( 21.2% , n = 7 ) . The number of days practiced per week varied within the sample , including 31.3 % ( n = 10 ) one to three days per week , 37.6% ( n = 12 ) four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 10 ) 7 days per week . The majority of the meditators practiced between 15 and 45 minutes ( 78.8% , n = 26 ) at each session , while only 9.1% ( n = 3 ) practiced less than 15 minutes and 12.1% ( n = 4 ) practiced longer than 45 minutes . Of the individuals currently involved in a relationship , 50% ( n = 10 ) of the sample had " significant others " who also practiced meditation . PROCEDURE <p> Participants were randomly selected from mailing lists provided by the Association of Transpersonal Psychology or were solicited via classified advertising in the Chicago Tribune and the Dallas Morning News . Participants were sent a letter providing information about the current study and a self-addressed , stamped postcard . Participants were to indicate on the postcard if they were interested in participating in the current study and the number of meditator and/or non meditator questionnaire packets they would like to receive . Thus , after the return of the postcard , packet(s) and a self-addressed stamped envelope were mailed to the individual . The questionnaire packets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a consent form for participation in the study . Also , for individuals requesting meditator packets , an additional form was included which inquired about their usual length of meditative practice , type of practice , feelings when not practicing , retreat participation , and perceived effect of meditation on everyday life . Measures <p> The Symptom Checklist 90-Revised ( SCL-90-R ; Derogatis &; Spencer , 1989 ) was utilized as a measure of psychological adaptation . The SCL-90-R is a 90-item self-report inventory measuring nine clinical dimensions of psychological distress ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , somatization , etc. ) and provides a global index of distress ( GSI ) . T-scores are available for each dimension and the GSI ( M = 50 ; SD = 10 ) . The authors have shown the SCL-90-R to have high internal consistency and reliability . <p> The Traditional Egalitarian Sex Role ( TESR ; Larsen &; Long , 1988 ) is a 20-item self-report scale measuring attitudes toward traditional-egalitarian beliefs about sex roles . Items are on a 5-point continuum from " strongly disagree " to " strongly agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . The TESR has been shown to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability . <p> The Short-Form Dogmatism Scale ( SFDS ; Schulze , 1962 ) is a reduced version of the Rokeach 's ( 1960 ) dogmatism scale . The SFDS is a 16-item self-report scale . Responses are coded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from " strongly disagree " to " strongly agree " ; thus higher scores reflect increased levels of dogmatism . The SFDS has been shown to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability ( Robinson &; Shaver , 1973 ) . RESULTS Analysis of Dependent Variables Between Groups <p> A 2 x 2 ( group x gender ) MANOVA was performed to examine for differences on all indices of psychosocial adaptation ( see Table 1 for means and standard deviations ) . The analysis yielded no significant interaction ( Wilk 's F ( 3,58 ) = .86 , p = .469 ) for level of psychological distress , gender stereotyping , and dogmatism . There were no significant group ( Wilk 's F ( 3,58 ) = 1.22 , p = .31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 2.53 , p = .07 ) differences for level of psychological distress , gender stereotyping or dogmatism . Analyses of Dependent Variables Within Groups <p> Interrelationships between dependent measures were examined utilizing zero-order correlations ( see Table 2 ) . For the non-meditators , analyses yielded significant correlations between increased gender stereotyping and both higher levels of psychological distress ( r = .44 , p < .01 ) and higher levels of dogmatism ( r = .59 , p < .001 ) . In contrast , for the meditator group , analyses yielded no significant correlations between indices of psychosocial adaptation ( p > .05 ) . <p> Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was utilized to explore further the interrelationships between dependent measures . The index of gender stereotyping was utilized as the criterion measure ( see Table 3 ) . To minimize between-group variability , demographic parameters were entered simultaneously in block one . Indices of dogmatism and psychological distress were entered in block 2 utilizing stepwise entry ( i.e. , entering only if contributing significant variance ) . For the nonmeditators , demographic parameters were not significant predictors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = .35 ) . However , both dogmatism ( R 2 change = .27 , p = .01 ) and psychological distress ( R 2 change = .09 , p = .04 ) contributed significant variance to the model . For the meditators , the demographic parameters were not predictive of gender stereotyping ( R 2 change = .19 , p = .14 ) . Indices of dogmatism and psychological distress did not contribute significant variance in prediction of gender stereotyping . CONCLUSION <p> The purpose of the present study was to examine differences between meditators and non meditators on indices of psychosocial adaptation . Further , the interrelationships between psychological distress , gender stereotyping , and dogmatism were explored within each group . The analyses of group differences revealed no significant differences between meditators and non meditators on indices of psychosocial adaptation indicating a relative degree of similarity between groups . Although findings from the analyses of group differences are inconsistent with our initial hypothesis , examination of the interrelationships between dependent measures did in fact reveal differential patterns within each group . <p> Findings from the correlational analysis within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both dogmatism and psychological distress . These findings are consistent with previous literature ( e.g. , Raden , 1994 ; Sidanius , 1993 ) which suggest that maladaptation occurs as a function of a restricted range of viewing others . However , for the non-meditators , dogmatism was not related to psychological distress . In contrast , no significant relationships were found between indices of psychosocial adaptation for the meditators . The multiple regression analyses revealed similar findings , with both dogmatism and psychological distress predicting gender stereotyping for the non-meditators , but not for the meditators . <p> What could account for the within group variability that was not detected in between-group analyses ? Although the measures utilized in the current study have proven to be both valid and reliable , limitations do exist in utilizing self-report measures to detect between group variability on sensitive issues such as gender stereotyping and dogmatism ( Isaac &; Michael , 1985 ) . Given that the participating meditators and non-meditators were both self-selected and well-educated , differences between groups could be masked due to the nature of the responses required of the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be an advanced meditator to respond to questions about gender stereotyping or dogmatism in a manner that would resemble advanced levels of self-actualization . Similarly , the moral development literature clearly documents that moral reasoning , a purely cognitive expression , usually occurs at a " higher " level than moral behavior ( Gilligan , 1982 ; Kohlberg , 1984 ) . <p> The findings of the present study point towards the limitations of conventional research methodology in exploration of personality variables thought to be influenced by the practice of meditation . Although between-group analyses yielded no differences , multicollinearity existed on indices of psychosocial adaptation for the non-meditators , but not for the meditators . Future research is necessary which applies both quantitative and qualitative research methodology . Self-report measures , such as those utilized in the current study can provide a global index of psychosocial adaptation . The information obtained can then be utilized as a guide in the development of frameworks for a variety of qualitative research methods , such as participant observation or grounded theory approach . The use of qualitative research methodologies might result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each individual ( Dey , 1993 ; Jorgensen , 1989 ; Strauss &; Corbin , 1990 ) . Although there is a vast amount of literature on meditation and types of meditation practice , qualitative research could be utilized to determine if meditative practice differentially influences psychosocial adaptation of individuals from diverse ethnic , educational , and socioeconomic backgrounds . Due to the diversity among meditators , qualitative research might more clearly delineate the psychosocial differences between individuals within specific meditation practices . <p> 
##4001967 Section : EDITORIAL <p> Americans are a remarkably religious people . Virtually every poll measuring the state of religious belief in the United States reports that at least 90 percent of Americans possess some form of religious faith . The latest poll , conducted by Goldhaber Research Associations , reports that 90.7 percent of Americans profess to have a religion . Of these , an overwhelming majority ( 83.8 percent ) identify their religion as either Protestant ( 55.2 percent ) or Catholic ( 28.6 percent ) . These figures indicate that despite the steady growth of non-Christian religions in the United States , most Americans still describe themselves as Christians . In view of this , and as another national election day approaches , it is appropriate to give consideration to several issues facing Christians as they engage in the political process . <p> Most Christians want to be good citizens , but are confused by the demands of dual citizenship ( heaven and earth ) . As a result , they are constantly wrestling with questions about how their faith affects their politics . How politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the church to achieve spiritual goals ? Does God favor the agenda of one political party over that of others ? Should the Ten Commandments be legally enforced ? When confronted with questions like these , many Christians would of course disagree on the answers , but perhaps many more would admit to being unsure of how to respond . <p> There is , to be sure , a great deal of confusion today about the guidelines for Christian engagement in the political arena . Indeed , it has been controversies over the role of Christianity in shaping the nation 's law and public policy , especially the restrictions placed on that role by the doctrine of separation of church and state , that have been among those issues at the forefront of the debate now taking place across America on the important question of who will win the right to control America 's destiny . <p> I <p> The battle now being waged to direct America 's future might best be described as a " culture war . " What is this culture war all about ? According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia who has written extensively on the subject , the culture war is essentially about " political and social hostility rooted in different systems of moral understanding . " Hunter identifies the combatants as the " orthodox " and the " progressives . " The " orthodox , " he says , are social conservatives from a variety of traditional religious perspectives , but mostly Catholics , Protestants , and Jews , who basically understand that human beings are on this earth as God 's agents to carry out His will in all dimensions of life . They see the increased secularization of America as a call to redivinize the culture , to put God back in society and culture . If political means will assist in achieving this end , so be it . America will be the better for it . <p> The " progressives , " on the other hand , are warriors from a far more diverse religious landscape . They too are Catholics , Protestants , and Jews , but are joined by many Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists , Taoists , Native Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many unbelievers . They differ from the " orthodox " in that they see religion as fundamentally a private matter rather than a public concern around which civil society should be shaped . They favor compromise in politics , and are very concerned about anyone at the political level being able to impose God 's will on others . <p> Regardless of the labels employed to classify those fighting the so-called culture war , most would agree that Americans today increasingly find themselves at odds on many important questions . Is America a secular state or a Christian state ? Is the nation becoming so secularized that it risks the very judgment of God ? Should not Christians take charge of their nation in order to bring it back to its moral senses ? Is church-state separation a help or a hindrance to the realization of a healthy America ? To what extent should our nation 's law and public policy on such issues as education , sexual immorality , and school prayer reflect religious , even biblical values ? Americans , and yes , even Christians disagree on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides in the conflict increasingly refuse to forfeit the nation 's destiny to the other , the outcome is nothing less than a culture war . <p> If we think about it , those fighting the culture war are actually only trying to bring about a unified America . There is nothing wrong with a goal of unity , to be sure , but must it be achieved at the expense of others ' religious views ? Must those holding to a particular set of religious ideas be pushed to the periphery , freeing those of a different religious persuasion -- the victors in a culture war -- to reshape culture on their own terms ? Is religion even the basis upon which we should seek unity ? Pat Buchanan , for one , believes that it is . In 1993 , several months after the Republicans lost the presidential election to Bill Clinton , Buchanan organized and held a conference titled " Winning the Culture War . " This is certainly one approach to bringing about unity in America , but are there not other , less combative approaches ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer competing approaches to performing their dual citizenship as Christians . These are the Reconstructionists , the Religious Right , the Civil Religionists , and the Pluralists . The first two fit Hunter 's " orthodox " category , the latter two his " progressive . " I shall argue that we err not so much in being " orthodox " or " progressives , " but in using religion as the primary basis for cultural and political unity . The first three approaches commit this fatal error ; only the Pluralists seek unity on other , less specifically religious grounds , which I shall suggest is the more biblical approach . <p> II <p> Reconstructionism is a growing Christian movement which believes that the law given by God for the political and legal ordering of ancient Israel is intended for all people in all ages ; therefore , the United States is duty bound to install a political system based entirely on biblical law . Reconstructionism , which claims 20 million adherents in America but probably is considerably smaller , actively seeks to unify the nation by imposing a theocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of a nation by God through divinely selected spokespersons , has many exemplars in the modem world . Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Iraq are nations with obvious theocratic tendencies . But the Reconstructionists advocate what may be the purest form of theocracy . According to Rousas J. Rushdoony , a leader of the movement , the society that fails to implement a biblical theocracy " places itself on death row : it is marked for judgment . " The Reconstructionsts ' revamped polity would require capital punishment for adulterers , homosexuals , and incorrigible children . No profession of faith other than Christianity would be tolerated . Were it otherwise , say Rushdoony , " in the name of toleration , the believer is asked to associate on a common level of total acceptance with the atheist , the pervert , and criminal and the adherents of other religions . " In other words , religious liberty , the right of all citizens to worship according to the demands of their consciences , would cease . All heresy would be stamped out through the enforcement of biblical law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions . America would be a democracy in name only . <p> From a biblical standpoint , Reconstructionism is problematic because of the dispensational character of the Old Testament order . Christ 's announcement in Matthew 5:17 that He had come to fulfill the Law indicated that he was the One to whom all of the Law ( civil , moral , and ceremonial ) had pointed and was to find its ultimate fulfillment . In other words , all of the holy demands of the Law , all of the strict requirements of being a nation ruled by God , found their completion in Jesus Christ , who alone could satisfy them . Add to this Christ 's admonition to obey the Roman secular authorities , and the fact that He never took steps to reinaugurate Israel 's old theocratic system , and we are left with the conclusion that America should avoid , on biblical grounds , constructing a theocracy based on the teaching of the Old Testament . <p> III <p> What we have come to know in our day as the Religious Right , dominated organizationally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a more subtle yet pervasive infusion of Christian principles into the way the nation operates . In many ways the rhetoric of the Religious Right is indistinguishable from that of the Re-constructionists . Jerry Falwell , for example , asserts that " God promoted America to a greatness as no other nation has ever enjoyed because her heritage is one of a republic government by laws predicated on the Bible . " David Barton , in his widely circulated book , The Myth of Separation , argues that the Founding Fathers intended " that this nation should be a Christian nation ; not because all who lived in it were Christians , but because it was founded on and would be governed by Christian principles . " In the Religious Right 's program for America , law would become " Christianized , " and those outside the fold would , over time , become convinced of the merits of a nation constructed on biblical principles . Non-Christians would not be denied the right to worship privately according to their own beliefs , but they would be expected to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . There would be Christian prayer in the public schools , Christian symbols in the public square , public monies available to religious enterprises ( with most going to those operated by the culturally dominant faith , Christianity ) , and governments in which the principle seats were held by Christians . <p> As evangelical scholar Richard V. Pierard notes , " The Religious Right . . . are not willing to accept the idea that we have a secular state . . . . The genius of the American system is that in religious matters the government remains neutral . This environment allows all to practice their faiths freely and not impose them through government . " <p> The real failure , then , of the program of the Religious Right is its failure to deal with religious pluralism . It ignores our nation 's increasingly pluralistic makeup in favor of a program to create political unity on distinctively religious terms . Indeed , non-Christian religions in the United States -- Jews , Muslims , Buddhists , Hindus , and others -- now claim an increasing percentage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ would approve of a nation 's neutral status toward all religions , a framework which gives no legal preference whatsoever to Christianity . Christ never suggested in his own day that the Roman Empire should become Christian ; in fact , he advocated submission to a form of government that embraced emperor worship . When Christ said in John 18:36 : " My kingdom is not of this world , " he was affirming that Christian witness is not centered on the making of temporal Christian kingdoms , but on the making of Christian persons who will enjoy an everlasting heavenly kingdom . There is little reason to think that the emphasis for Christians today should be any different . <p> IV <p> It is natural that Reconstructionists and the Religious Right , as representatives of the " orthodox " in today 's culture war , would attempt to unite America around her culturally dominant faith , Christianity . Others , however , seeking to be more accommodating to the growing presence in America of non-Christian religions , have sought in a less particularistic way to find a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Franklin called " public religion , " or what has become known in our own day as " civil religion , " represents an effort to locate that common ground , that shared set of symbols that can be transmitted across regions , generations , and peoples in America . The search for a civil religion perhaps springs from the belief of most Americans that God is sovereign over their nation , that He is the one who gives meaning to their shared existence , and that all Americans must in some way bind together as a people in recognition of this fundamental reality . <p> The symbols and ceremonies of civil religion include the national motto , " In God We Trust " ; the inclusion of " God " in the pledge of allegiance ; the display of the American flag in church auditoriums ; the blending of God and country in national holidays such as Independence Day , Memorial Day , and Thanksgiving ; and the now common presidential statement appended to virtually all public addresses : " God Bless America . " <p> Many Christians see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil religion and even to blending them . Many , for example , heartily approved of President Bush 's speech at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in 1992 , which included this statement : " In the Persian Gulf we fought for good versus evil -- it was that clear to me . . . . And American stood fast so that liberty could stand tall . Today I want to thank you for helping America , as Christ ordained , to be a light unto the world . " Bush 's statement points out one of the dangers of civil religion : it sometimes uses religion as a tool to legitimize governmental policies . Hence it politicizes religion to make it a function of the nation . Examined in this light , we might say that Bush 's statement trivialized religion by making it serve only a small segment of the world 's population instead of relating it to universal truths applicable to all people . How do we know that God approved of America 's attack against Iraq ? Perhaps God would have preferred to spare the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying the $64 billion price tag to more humanitarian purposes . No one , I submit , can answer these questions with the kind of certainty presupposed in Bush 's statement . <p> Since one of the major reasons for civil religion is to unify people behind government , there also is always the danger that government will abandon its " neutral " role in dealing with the nation 's diversity of religions . This is evident in the perennial call for more prayer in the public schools . Prayer in a religiously plural society must inevitably be nonsectarian or content neutral and hence becomes an aspect of civil religion . For many people of faith , generic , watered-down prayers are a sacrilege , and they would prefer no prayer to bland prayer crafted to unify and offend as few of the listeners as possible . <p> It is hard to be against anything that can help to unify ' America . Civil religion should not be neglected out of hand ; it might have a significant role in bringing the American people together . But Christians must never allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As John Swomley has written , the " god " of civil religion can be " a very small and exclusive deity , a friend to American power and prestige , and the object of a national folk religion with little claim to truth . " <p> V <p> Another available option toward unifying the country , more palatable to " progressives " than to the " orthodox , " is simply to affirm that religious pluralism is real , that people understand ultimate concerns differently , and that the freedom to disagree on fundamental religious questions is not in itself undesirable -- in short , recognizing that we will never create an earthly " utopia , " and that we must lay aside divisive religious questions and concentrate on seeking to unify politically around a core of more secularly-oriented concerns such as peace , justice , liberty , and equality . Adherents of this approach might be called " Pluralists . " <p> Many Christians would object to this alternative on the grounds that God 's main concern is the salvation of all people , that He " desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the truth " ( 1 Tim . 2:4 ) . Why not , they would argue , use all available means , including political means , to bring about what is God 's will ? The answer to this is to recognize that Christ taught that spiritual goals and political goals are not synonymous . In Matthew 22:21 , Christ said that Christians are to " render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's ; and to God the things that are God 's . " Christ here was affirming that spiritual commitments are to be distinguished from political commitments . <p> Christ perfectly modeled this distinction between spiritual and temporal ends . He never advocated the overthrow of the Roman government , or even its adjustment , in favor of a more theocratic order . He never identified Himself with any particular form of government , nor did He even remotely suggest that it was the duty of human government to aid His mission . Christ was amazingly unconcerned with much of what falls under the rubric of politics . He preached against tyranny and oppression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to Himself and it was apparently a secondary matter to Him what specific form of government ( monarchy , democracy , etc. ) men live under . The temporal was for him far less important than the eternal ; thus He focused on the spiritual rather than the physical aspects of Kingdom building . The idea of a " Christian " nation , it seems , was foreign to him . <p> If Christ was largely unconcerned with many of the details of politics and far more concerned with soul winning , perhaps Christians should be too . Christians in America , it seems , frequently become too concerned with the need for government to become identified with Christian principles . Many Christians wrongly believe that Christianity will flourish in a more Christian political environment . History shows the opposite to be true . Christianity grew more rapidly than at any time in history in the first three centuries after Christ 's death when Christians were persecuted for not bowing the knee to Caesar . Christians understandably sought more favorable political conditions for themselves . By the fourth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by means of outright persecution ; the emperor Constantine placed it on a neutral basis with other religions in 313 A.D. , and in 380 A.D. Theodosius made it the official religion of the empire . The faith thereafter lost much of its vitality , distinctiveness , and vigor , owing to its preferred political status . Merged with government , Christianity became consumed with temporal affairs -- armies , police , crime , taxation , commerce , economics , etc. -- and less focused on the mission outlined for it by Christ and the apostles . In its witness , the Church gradually began to rely less on the power of its spiritual message than on the power of the sword to enforce its political will . The persecuted had turned persecutor . More recently , much the same phenomenon occurred in China following the Communist Revolution in 1949 . An immediate crackdown on religion that lasted some twenty-five years resulted in the greatest spread of Christianity to have occurred in China before or since . <p> I would hope not to be misunderstood here . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , politics is part of the moral universe , and Christians are rightly concerned with morality . In their daily lives , Christians are to be Christian citizens , not merely Christians . But because the Bible does not require that political and governmental affairs be Christian , those who are Christians are free to join with non-Christians in our democratic form of government to make laws that from the perspective of the American people as a whole , not from the perspective of their own interpretation of the Bible , best ensure the common good . In this process , negotiation and compromise are not dirty words , and Christians should be satisfied with laws that fall short of biblical standards as they understand them . Biblical standards may dictate the contributions that Christians make toward the formation of laws , but Christians do not fail God if the negotiated product , even laws on such controversial areas as abortion , school prayer , and homosexuality , do not meet their standards . The goal , even duty , of Christians should be to assist the government in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shared morality , not to set up a Kingdom of God on earth . <p> Meanwhile , Christians should vigorously pursue the spiritual mission of the Church , which is to do good to all people ( Galatians 6:10 ) , and to spread the gospel ( Matthew 28:19-20 ) . They might call upon the government to assist them in the first task , but not in the second . They can expect government to assist those who struggle against the common enemies of man -- tyranny , poverty , disease , and war -- but to expect the government , or to attempt to use the government . to spread the gospel is a perspective that is absolutely foreign to the Bible . In fulfilling the first task , Christians participate with other citizens who share membership in our nation . In fulfilling the second , they look only to the Christian community , what the apostle Peter called a " holy nation " ( 1Peter 2:9 ) . This approach pays a healthy respect to the principle of separation between church and state . If Christians want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make America a religious state with the authority to define its religious character in ways that might impede their ability to determine God 's truth for themselves and to share it with others . <p> VI <p> Many of Hunter 's " orthodox " are victims of the rising tide of American nationalism , which seeks to express itself in terms of religious faith and which would make Christianity in America a culture religion or tribal faith . As James E. Wood , Jr . has said , " To be a good American and a good Christian are not one and the same and can never be . Americanism can never be synonymous with true Christian faith . God and Christianity are not something our nation can possess or which can be contained within our national life ; nor is God some national resource we can harness or use to serve our national interests . God remains always above culture and nation , which are under His divine judgment . The mere claim of any nation that it is on God 's side is of no real consequence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemy than godliness . " To give to Caesar that which belongs only to God is surely one of the great profanations of modern man . The genius of the American tradition is the affirmation that authentic religious faith is a voluntary thing . True religious commitment does not issue from political initiative or legislative decree , but only from the voluntary responses of free men to God 's calling . <p> Christians should never take pride in being engaged in a culture war . The very language of culture war is self-defeating . It pushes people into opposite camps instead of encouraging them to seek areas of common ground . The " us against them " approach hardly lives up to the love and compassion that Christ called His people to live by . Christians are better off encouraging all Americans to be full and equal participants in the political process , not to see who wins , but to share in crafting a government that best serves all of the people . It was Reinhold Niebuhr who said that it is the achievement of democracy , not a sectarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public philosophy . In the end , Christians ' greatest priority should be the gospel , not creating a Christian state . The result might be a more but never completely Christian culture , but one achieved through persuasion , not law . <p> By DEREK H. DAVIS <p> 
##4000054 Section : Features Research sheds new light on the origin of humanity 's most intimate quadruped ally <p> The poor dog , " wrote poet Lord Byron in a flight of emotion , " in life the firmest friend , The first to welcome , foremost to defend . " And certainly , few animal lovers would care to differ . The dog , after all , is commonly referred to as man 's best friend , and unquestionably serves a wide range of human purposes . Thanks to artificial selection , there are dogs that guard houses and dogs that herd livestock , dogs that locate game birds for shooting and dogs that retrieve game birds that have been shot , dogs that pull sleds and dogs that sit languidly in human laps . <p> Clearly , the relationship between dog and human runs deep in our culture and our psyches . No surprise , then , that the origin of the domestic dog has long been a matter for speculation and inquiry . But now , new techniques of molecular biology are allowing researchers to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways previously unavailable to traditional wildlife biologists , taxonomists , and archeologists . Investigators are making great strides in understanding the origin of the domestic dog , even though results are often subject to dispute and controversy , as might be expected of research on a creature that is genetically complex . <p> " No other species is so diverse , " says Robert Wayne , a University of California-Los Angeles evolutionary biologist who has just completed the largest study ever on dog genetics and evolution . " Dogs are a model for how rapid morphological change might take place in a natural population . " They also offer clues as to how genetic vigor can be maintained in domestic species . <p> One of the key questions of dog evolution focuses on the source : From what wild creature did the domestic dog arise ? Charles Darwin suggested that the close relationship between wolves , coyotes , and jackals-all of which can interbreed-so muddies questions of which species yielded the dog that " we shall probably never be able to ascertain the dog 's origins with certainty . " Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s by suggesting that some dog breeds may derive from jackals , others from wolves . Other biologists have proposed that dogs sprang from coyotes . Archeological evidence collected at ancient human homesites does not help , because the bones of animals in the process of domestication generally do not reveal intermediate steps between wild forebears and modern domestic animals . <p> New genetic evidence marshaled by Wayne and his colleagues lends strong support to the wolf advocates . As Wayne 's team reported in the 13 June Science , they analyzed mitochondrial DNA from 140 domestic dogs representing 67 breeds and five crossbreeds , then compared the dogs ' sequences with DNA from 162 wolves collected at 27 localities worldwide as well as with DNA from five coyotes and eight Simien , two golden , and two black-backed jackals . <p> " The genetic data strongly suggest that the wolf is the progenitor of the domestic dog , " Wayne says . Dog gene sequences differ from those of wolves by at most 12 nucleotide substitutions , whereas dog sequences differ from coyote and jackal sequences by at least 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very different genetically from wolves and dogs , " Wayne says . <p> Identifying these genetic differences did more than establish the wolf as ancestor to the domestic dog . It also yielded further conclusions about dog evolution that surprised even Wayne himself and engendered dispute with other experts . <p> Based on studies of canid bones found at human archeological sites , researchers have traditionally placed the domestic dog 's origins at about 10,000-14,000 years ago . As discussed in the Science article , Wayne and his colleagues ' molecular data indicate that the dog actually is much older . Wayne 's lab did a smaller study of wolf and dog nuclear DNA which showed that the two animals differ by only 1-2% of their gene sequences . Because fossil data show that wolves and coyotes , which differ genetically by 7.5% , diverged approximately 1 million years ago , Wayne calculates that the genetic difference between wolf and dog suggests that they separated about 135,000 years ago . If his conclusion is correct , then the dog is by far humanity 's oldest domestic animal . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 years ago . <p> Such a surprising assertion has inevitably spawned controversy . If wolves and dogs diverged when Wayne suggests , some experts ask , then why does the archeological record fail to show morphological differences between wolf and dog fossils until about 14,000 years ago ? Wayne guesses that a phenotypic divergence between the two animals began only after humanity converted from hunter-gatherer cultures to more agricultural societies about 10,000-15,000 years ago , imposing new selective regimes on dogs . <p> Darcy Morey , an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville whose doctoral dissertation focused on the evolution of humankind 's relationship with the dog , disagrees with Wayne 's interpretation of the evidence . " How could so fundamental an ecological change occur between wild and domestic populations without altering the animals ' size and form ? " Morey asks . <p> Wayne 's research is " an elegant study , " geneticist Stephen O'Brien says , but it presumes that the mitochondrial DNA clock runs at a constant rate through time . " That might not be correct , " says O'Brien , chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Frederick , Maryland . O'Brien , who has done genetic studies on wild and domestic cats , says that calculating precise dates is difficult , particularly if altered sex ratios or population bottlenecks affect a species ' evolution . <p> Wayne agrees that mitochondrial DNA , which evolves rapidly and at uneven rates of change , gives only a rough estimate of the evolutionary relationship between species . But , because mitochondrial DNA does mutate rapidly , he believes that it is the best currently available method for gauging genetic change . He admits that his study may inflate the date of origin for the domestic dog , but he contends that his evidence is nevertheless correct in indicating that the dog did arise long before the date ascribed to it by archeological evidence . Wayne plans to test micro-satellites , a set of fast-evolving nuclear genes , to confirm the mitochondrial DNA results . Wolves become dogs <p> Regardless of when wolves came into the human domain , the relationship wrought fundamental changes on the wolf , remolding the wild animal . Most notably , dog skulls , teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An adult dog with the same head size as an adult wolf has a 20% smaller brain , says Ray Coppinger , a professor of biology at Hampshire College in Amherst , Massachusetts , who has spent years studying dog evolution and behavior . And an adult dog of the same weight as an adult wolf has a 20% smaller head . Also , some physical traits that do not appear in wolves are common in dogs , including a sickle-shaped tail , floppy ears , and piebald color patterns . <p> Dogs and wolves differ in their behavior as well . For example , female dogs usually come into heat twice yearly , but wolves only once . Moreover , many adult dogs beg for food , a behavior typical of wolf puppies but not of adults . Dogs greet and lick their human masters the way wolf pups do their elders . <p> Some of the physical traits characteristic of certain dog breeds , such as floppy ears and rounded profiles , do appear in wolves , but only as pups . This appearance of youthful wolf traits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immature . <p> A hunter trains his laborador retriever by throwing decoys that the dog is ordered to return . By modifying through artificial selection the innate behavior of the dog 's wolf ancestor , such as the urge to chase prey , humankind has produced a domestic animal of many abilities . <p> Morey suggests that retention of juvenile morphological and behavioral traits by adult dogs was due to natural , rather than artificial , selection . Presumably , dog domestication began when humans captured wolf pups and raised them as pets . In the wild , mature wolves leave the natal pack to seek mates and start their own packs , or they challenge the dominant animals in their packs and take over . Animals that did this to human masters would likely be killed , giving them little opportunity to contribute to the gene pool of the domestic dog . <p> The wolves that survived in the human environment and gave rise to dogs probably were individuals that preserved into adulthood the submission that wolf pups demonstrate toward adult wolves . This selection for submission presumably led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that successfully adapted to life in the shadow of humankind . " The consistent appearance of these traits in dogs living within so many different human cultures suggests that selection pressures broader than cultural ones brought about the changes , " Morey says . <p> Coppinger suspects that the genetic changes that allowed behavioral adaptation to the human environment led as well to the morphological changes characteristic of dogs , because some physical and behavioral changes may be genetically linked . Wayne agrees . " A lot of characters are linked genetically , " he says . " One change can affect various characteristics . Some things , like skull length , are controlled by many genes . If you change one gene or group of genes , that can affect several characteristics . " Whether the theory holds true for dog behavior and morphology remains to be proved , Wayne adds . <p> One experiment conducted in Russia in the 1960s and 1970s supports Coppinger 's ideas about a link between morphological and behavioral changes . D. K. Belyaev deliberately bred silver foxes , a subspecies of the red fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Cytology and Genetics , was seeking to develop animals suitable for fur ranching . <p> Belyaev observed that female silver foxes that were less aggressive than average and that lacked a fear of humans-necessary traits for tameness-also came into estrus and bore young independent of seasons . " The reorganization of the genetic basis of reproduction ... might have evolved through selection for certain behavioral responses , which may be especially characteristic of the early stages of domestication , " Belyaev wrote in the journal Genetics and Physiology in 1977 . <p> More telling still in terms of a genetic linkage between behavioral and morphological traits is the fact that , during 20 generations of selective breeding for tameness , Belyaev 's foxes developed morphological traits familiar among domestic dogs but not found in wild canids : hooked tails , drooping ears , twice-a-year breeding , and , in some cases , black-and-white piebald coats . The question of where <p> The subject of dog evolution is rich with unanswered questions , a garden of inquiry for the evolutionary biologist . In addition to determining which wild species yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on his genetic studies , had hoped that his research would help to locate the area of the globe in which dogs first appeared . But when he tried to link dog gene sequences to those of living wolf populations , he failed . He could not even determine whether dogs sprang from wolves once or several times . <p> One expert contends that no single point of origin exists . Stanley Olsen , a retired anthropologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson and author of the 1985 book Origins of the Domestic Dog , says that fossil evidence from hundreds of human archeological sites in Europe , the Near East , and Asia suggests that dogs evolved from different wolf populations in different places at different times . Olsen believes that large dogs may have derived from the large wolves of northern Europe , whereas small ones came from Asian and Near Eastern wolves . <p> Yet another study further complicates the issue by proposing three separate dog lineages . Ben Koop , a biologist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia , has been researching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ancestors of these animals crossed the dry Bering Strait with humans during the most recent Ice Age . <p> Using phylogenetic analysis on museum specimens of these Native American dogs , Koop com-pared the specimens ' mitochondrial gene sequences with those of museum-specimen and living wolves , coyotes , and foxes and of living domestic dogs . He found that gene sequences from the Native American dogs grouped together . The Native American dogs were more closely related to wolves than to domestic dogs , possibly because wolves and Native American dogs interbred occasionally . <p> Similarly , Koop found that all domestic dog breeds form a single group distinct from that of Native American dogs . That suggests , he says , that domestic dogs have a single , rather than multiple , origin , but arose apart from Native American dogs . But Koop also found an exception-the Arctic elkhound apparently evolved separately from all other dog breeds . It is the only breed known to have done so . <p> Koop 's research , by suggesting three dog lineages , so complicates theories about dog origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm confused . It 's new data that provides a new perspective , but it clouds the issue . You have to remember we have preliminary results based on what DNA we can get out of old museum hides . The material we had was pretty beat up . " <p> Wayne 's studies suggest that the dog 's complicated evolutionary history has yielded an animal of great genetic diversity . Even recognized dog breeds show remarkable genetic variation . Part of this diversity , Wayne thinks , stems from intermittent breeding that occurred between dogs and wolves even after domestication , providing raw material for artificial selection under human control and giving the dog great evolutionary plasticity . <p> The role that backcrossing with wolves played in the dog 's genetic vigor may serve as a model for artificial selection , Wayne 's work suggests . Domestic plants and animals whose feral forebears are now extinct can not avail themselves of genetic enrichment from wild populations , presumably putting a limit on how much they can be modified by artificial selection in the future . " Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , " the preservation of wild progenitors may be a critical issue in the continued evolution of domestic plants and animals .

##4000055 Section : Features Can genetics research help us to develop a picture of extinct creatures that left no fossils ? <p> One of the great conundrums of evolution concerns an event known as the Cambrian Explosion , an outburst of evolutionary productivity that , in about 20 million years , gave rise to all modern animal phyla some 550 million years ago . This event firmly roots all living creatures not only in that ancient time , but also in the darkness of a scientific mystery . All known Pre-Cambrian animal fossils-which admittedly are few in number-are of creatures of such simplicity that investigators from paleontologists to evolutionary biologists do not understand how they could have given rise to the more complex phyla of the Cambrian . Most of these species probably existed at the organizational level of modern jellyfish , in which fewer than a dozen specialized cell types form a conglomerate that functions as a single organism . More advanced animals , such as mammals , are composed of as many as 200 different cell types and many distinct tissues . <p> The fact that Pre-Cambrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cambrian Explosion suggests that more complex animals occurred in the Pre-Cambrian than the fossil record indicates . Some indirect evidence supports this possibility , including fossilized burrows and grooves in Pre-Cambrian ocean substrates that resemble the tracks of crawling worms . <p> What these more complex creatures were may never be known , but new evidence from developmental biology , based on the study of genes that play pivotal roles in early development in a wide spectrum of animal species , is providing some clues . " It 's doing paleontology without fossils , " says Sean Carroll , a molecular biologist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of Wisconsin-Madison . " We 're drawing a picture of something no one has ever seen . " <p> Carroll and his colleagues are using the techniques of molecular biology to chart a time crucial to the history of life . In a sense , the team is practicing genetic paleontology , sifting through the genetic machinery of modern phyla to find genes that offer clues about what certain unknown extinct creatures were like in a fossil-poor past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work on the genes that control the development of appendages has provided a new perspective on the common ancestor of modern living things , the nadir of the Cambrian explosion . A Pre-Cambrian survivor <p> The gene on which Carroll and his team have focused is called Distal-less , or Dll . This gene directs cells to create organs that bud off from a main body axis , including such appendages as legs and antennae . For example , developmental biologists have long known that Dll controls the development of the distal portion of insect limbs , that is , the portion farthest from the body . The gene encodes a homeodomain protein , one of a family of transcription factors that , among other functions , act to define body axes in vertebrates and invertebrates . The Dll protein in turn activates other genes that govern limb formation . However , the pathway by which Dll controls downstream genes remains unknown , says Jennifer Grenier , a researcher in Carroll 's lab . <p> Dll itself is turned on by the two genetic pathways that control formation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expression also is governed by homeotic proteins . For example , in Drosophila , Dll expression for legs and wings occurs in the thoracic limb-forming disks , but expression in the abdomen is repressed by homeotic proteins . As a result , these segments lack appendages . <p> Scientists have known for a long time about the role of Dll in insect limbs . However , Carroll and his colleagues discovered only two years ago that the gene occurs broadly in other animals , initiating the development of appendages in crustaceans , as Carroll 's team reported in the 24 November 1995 Science . Now , as described in the 13 May 1997 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Carroll and his team have shown that Dll is more pervasive within the animal kingdom than anyone has previously suggested . This finding yields new understanding about the origin of appendages and about the Pre-Cambrian precursor to modern phyla . Excavating a gene <p> To test for the activity of the Dll gene and its orthologs , collectively known as Dlx , the research team used Dll homeodomain antibody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broadly reactive across phyla . The researchers found Dll expression in the distal portion of the developing antennae and lobopods-primitive locomotory appendages-of the onychophoran species Peripa-topsis capensis and in the antennae and the distal portions of all developing parapodia-short processes on the segments of some annelids-in the polychaete Chaetopterus vario-pedatus . The gene also is expressed in the footlike ampullae of larval ascidians , in the siphons of adult ascidians , and in the spines and larval tube feet of sea urchins , which are echinoderms . <p> The team found Dll or its orthologs expressed in all six phyla that they tested , Carroll says , including three deuterostome phyla-chordates , enchinoderms , and urochordates-and three protostome phyla-arthropods , onycho-phora , and annelids . Because deuterostomes and proto-stomes differ fundamentally in the way in which their eggs undergo cleavage , they probably took separate evolutionary pathways hundreds of millions of years ago , suggesting only the most tenuous relationship between the two groups . This discovery raises the question of why such distantly related animals would use the same genetic mechanism for producing such divergent outgrowths . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of appendages , suggesting an ancestral link among them that dates to the Pre-Cambrian era . Clockwise from top , an onychophoran , a polychaete , an ascidian , and an echinoderm . <p> The researchers offer two answers to this question : Either each phylum independently coopted Dll genes for appendage formation from some other function , or Dll expression along the proximodistal axes arose only once , long ago , in some unknown creature that was the common ancestor of all modern phyla . Carroll and his colleagues lean toward the second explanation because , by requiring only one adoption of Dll to appendage formation , it is the more parsimonious explanation . <p> In taking this view , the researchers are suggesting a major change in the interpretation of appendage origin . Prior to the development of modern molecular biology , comparative anatomy was the primary means for investigating such elements of evolution as the origin of appendages . These traditional studies-which , for example , compared the anatomy of a vertebrate 's leg with that of an insect 's leg-long ago led to a consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently of one another . For example , a bird 's foot might be homologous to that of a dinosaur , but no one would suggest that a bird 's foot is a homologue of a spider 's leg . <p> And yet , Carroll 's studies indicate a direct genetic link between a spider 's leg and a bird 's , or a human 's . The Dll expression patterns suggest that the fundamental genetic mechanism for appendages arose once in an ancestor common to all six phyla . The fact that Dll is common to all six phyla that Carroll and his colleagues studied also suggests that the mechanism arose a long time ago . " This stuff , " says Carroll , " was in place by the Cambrian Explosion . " And that being so , then perhaps the unknown common Pre-Cambrian ancestor of modern phyla was not the simple , perhaps tubular , but definitely featureless creature that scientists have long speculated that it was . Perhaps , instead , it had appendages after all . <p> In the Proceedings article , Carroll and his colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ or simple locomotory appendages . This may have given it a tremendous advantage over limbless competitors hunting limbless prey . If so , appendages-and the Dll gene-may have been the foundation of an evolutionary arms race that led to the Cambrian Explosion . The appearance of appendages for feeding , swimming , predation , respiration , and other functions might have sped evolution along in what Carroll calls a " snowball analogy-as early life diversified , you get more roots for further diversification . " A different point of view <p> Carroll and his colleagues admit that they are making a leap in suggesting that the common , Pre-Cambrian ancestor of today 's phyla may have borne appendages . The idea that the creature might have had an outgrowth such as antennae would , as developmental biologist Brian Hall of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , pointed out in the 4 July Science , " have been a total heresy 10 years ago . " But the idea now is becoming increasingly acceptable in the face of the genetic evidence . <p> But not acceptable to everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Nipam Patel , a University of Chicago and Howard Hughes Medical Institute biologist who studies the genetics of limb formation , says that even if the gene occurred in a Pre-Cambrian common ancestor , " What the gene was used for is still hard to decipher . " The application of a gene can vary from organism to organism , he points out . <p> For example , in the protochordate amphioxus , Dll is expressed in the epidermis and the central nervous system . However , in vertebrates-whose five or six Dll homologues probably orginated from an ancestral gene that resembled the Dll of amphioxus-the gene is expressed in the mesoderm , although it is not expressed there in amphioxus . So , although it may occur across six phyla , Patel says , " we still do n't know what Distal-less does in these different organisms . " And , he says , we certainly can not know how the gene functioned in a long-extinct species . <p> The dark-rimmed oval at the top of this photograph of a mouse embryo is a limb bud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also plays a role in limb formation in a wide range of other phyla , as revealed by recent research at the University of Wisconsin and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute . <p> On a note of caution , Carroll 's team suggests in the Proceedings report that one explanation for the variety of Dll expressions may be that the gene pre-dates the appendage-bearing common ancestor and that the gene initially may have been expressed in the central nervous system before a genetic shift caused it to become involved in appendage formation . " This suggests , " the team writes , " that genetic components required for the genetic machinery for appendage formation evolved long before these structures arose . " The gene was then , they suggest , coopted for limb development sometime in the Pre-Cambrian and has been fulfilling that role ever since . <p> Carroll accepts that although his research provides rich food for thought and speculation , in the end how Dll was expressed in the Pre-Cambrian ancestor of modern phyla will remain unknown until fossil evidence appears . The wait for the fossil may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossilization among Pre-Cambrian animals , the role of Dll in that lost era may remain forever shrouded in mystery . <p> By Roger L.

##4000453 Section : EDUCATION POLICY <p> There is no question that the cost of a college degree is increasing rapidly . An oft-cited 1996 study by the General Accounting Office found that tuition and fees at public institutions have increased some 234 percent since 1980 while family income and the general inflation rate have increased only about 80 percent over the same period . Costs at private colleges and universities have fared little better , increasing more than 220 percent . <p> Many reasons have been given for the increasing costs of higher edition . Some of the most persuasive include the increased demand for college degrees , higher overhead costs associated with increased faculty research , recent reductions in state support of public institutions , and federal student aid programs that indirectly subsidize schools . These all are important factors that increase costs ; however , there is another reason not often mentioned . Colleges and universities , particularly elite private universities , exercise a certain degree of monopoly power that allows them to charge each individual student a higher price than would be the case otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . However , the emphasis is placed on the last one , the monopolistic power of schools . The Reasons for Increasing Costs <p> Increased value of a college degree . The most important reason college costs have escalated is that the value of a college education has increased . In fact , according to the General Accounting Office the average college graduate earned about 43 percent more than the average high school graduate did in 1980 . Today , the difference in earnings between these same two groups is more than 70 percent . Therefore , more and more families are finding it necessary to send their children to college so they will have a better opportunity to succeed in the job market . At the same time , the college age population in general has increased . This increased demand for higher education has driven up the price of college just as increased demand for any commodity drives up the price if that demand is not met with a sufficiently increased supply . <p> Increased research at universities . Another factor affecting tuition costs at many colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a college or university today is largely a function of the publishing prowess of the institution 's professors . Publishing requires research , which requires time . This means that professors are doing less teaching and more research . Fewer hours at the lectern for each professor means either that course and class selection are reduced , which forces students to take longer to finish a degree , or that more professors are required on staff , which forces the institution to spend more for salaries . Charles Sykes made this point in his excellent 1988 book , Profscam . Either way , the result is higher fixed or overhead costs , which typically are passed on to students and parents through higher tuition and fees . <p> Reduced state funding for public institutions . In addition , the current era of fiscal austerity in government has meant slower growth in state budgets , which often has meant slower growth in financial support of public universities . According to Department of Education statistics , state government funds accounted for 46.3 percent of public institution revenues in 1980 . By 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the only recourse for public institutions simultaneously faced with increased demand and shrinking state support . <p> Federal programs that facilitate family debt . Federal programs meant to assist students facing steep college costs have themselves added to the rise in tuition . Starting with passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 , the federal government has guaranteed student loans extended by private banks . The Student Loan Marketing Association ( Sallie Mae ) was established in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise to establish a secondary market in student loans . In addition , a limited direct government loan program was established in 1993 . These loan programs not only facilitate indebtedness , but also boost the scale of that indebtedness by encouraging steeper tuition increases . As Thomas Donlan recently wrote in Barron 's magazine , " The faculty and staff Can vote themselves higher salaries and more resources if the only consequence is that students and parents just have to sign on the dotted line to borrow some more money . " With federal debt assistance so readily available , schools have no incentive to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increased demand , increased research , and reduced state funding all affect the " sticker " price of a college degree -- the advertised tuition that a school charges . However , federal programs ( and to a lesser extent private scholarships and institutional aid ) that subsidize students directly affect not only the sticker price of college but also the actual price paid by a student and his family . Most students and their families do not pay the full sticker price just as few people pay the full sticker price for a new automobile . In fact , thanks to subsidized loans , institutional scholarships , state subsidies , and federal grants , schools can usually get away with charging each student a different price . Thus , the same education typically costs every student a different amount . <p> The ability to charge different students different prices is known in economic terms as price discrimination . Only firms with monopolistic power are able to engage in price discrimination . The result of price discrimination is that colleges are able to charge each student exactly as much as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem fair and financial aid is often touted as " leveling the playing field , " the fact is that price discrimination rarely benefits any consumers , even those with low incomes . To understand this it is important first to understand the basis of every economic transaction that takes place in the marketplace . <p> Everyone who takes part in any economic transaction does so because he believes he will be better off after the deal than before . Why otherwise should he engage in the trade ? For example , if you , the student , decide to purchase a semester of classes at a particular school for $10,000 then you have made a decision that at present that semester of classes is worth more to you than holding on to the $10,000 . If this were not the case then you would be better off holding on to the cash or making another purchase . The extra value you receive from that transaction -- above and beyond the $10,000 paid -- is known as your consumer surplus . <p> The university is making exactly the same calculation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpires then the school has obviously decided that the $10,000 in cash is more valuable than not spending the time and resources to offer the classes . The excess value on this side of the ledger is known in economic terms as producer surplus . This example helps illustrate that a transaction will transpire only when both the purchaser and the seller receive some surplus value from the deal and conversely , an economic transaction will always occur if there is a surplus to be gained by both the consumer and the producer . <p> Of course , the actual amount of surplus enjoyed by the consumer or producer is difficult if not impossible to measure in most individual market transactions . However , it generally is true that a consumer will receive a greater surplus in a competitive market ( one served by many producers ) , than in a monopolistic market ( one served by a small number of producers ) and a producer will enjoy a larger surplus in a monopolistic market . This is because in a competitive market the consumer can switch from one producer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is receiving . Competition among producers lowers prices and thus increases consumer surplus at the expense of producer surplus . Firms that have monopolistic power , however , need not compete with other producers as much and are able to retain a larger surplus for themselves . In short , monopolistic producers have the luxury of determining exactly how much an individual will pay for their services and charging precisely that amount . Consumers have little choice but to pay the monopolist 's price . <p> What , then , is the lesson for higher education ? Colleges and universities have greater monopolistic power today than ever before . This fact came to the forefront in 1991 when a group of Ivy League schools were investigated by the Department of Justice for collusion in setting their tuition prices . In short , these schools agreed that they would no longer offer merit-based scholarships and would offer financial aid on the basis of need only . Thus , the schools involved agreed to end economic competition for talented students . The Department of Justice broke up the Ivy League cartel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of monopolistic power by schools of higher learning . <p> In fact , the power of the monopoly has spread beyond a small number of elite institutions and has been widely adopted by more ordinary colleges and universities . In part , this expansion is attributable to a failure to meet the increased demand for higher education with a commensurate increase in supply . It is difficult to build a new college or university . And so the same number of schools is serving an increasing number of students . This will eventually even out as new colleges are created and gain a reputation in the marketplace , but that will take time . <p> More directly and of greater concern is that federal student aid has enabled monopolistic practices by schools . Colleges and universities are able to increase the sticker price beyond the reach of most students and then reduce the actual price charged individual students by offering them various bundles of financial aid . Thus , each student is offered a different price that matches almost exactly what he or she is willing to pay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decreased and the school 's ( producer ) surplus is increased . In the end , students will benefit less from the education because colleges and universities have captured more of their consumer surplus . This " captured consumer surplus " may be a greater percentage of the family 's income than would have been paid under competitive circumstances . Or , it may mean that the student receives a lower-value education ( from his or her perspective ) . For example , the student may have to endure larger class sizes or more graduate student led classes . <p> Additional producer surplus means that schools may engage in activities that would not be possible in a competitive market . For example , schools may be able to operate academic programs that advance a certain political agenda favored by the school 's administrators even if that agenda has been discredited in the real world . The existence of an educational monopoly may thus help explain why so many schools continue to preach the benefits of communism despite that political and economic system 's complete failure in the former Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools offer certain administrators and tenured faculty . In a less manipulated system , competition would discourage such excesses . All of these activities benefit the school establishment at the expense of students . <p> Despite the obvious fact that more students will be worse off given the monopolistic power of universities , some believe that a system of high sticker price and redistributive financial aid is socially beneficial because it helps those students from low income families . However appealing this may sound , it is simply untrue . Remember that the nature of any monopoly ( in this case colleges and universities ) is to reduce the consumer surplus of all customers not just the wealthy . <p> This hypothesis has been borne out by the data . David C. Rose and Robert L. Sorensen , in a 1992 article in the Southern Economic Journal found " that while institutions that appear to inflate their tuition do make larger aid awards , their awards are not large enough to reduce the average net price paid by needy students . " What is more , the University of St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended on increased administrative overhead , faculty salaries , and stipends for graduate students , rather than lower tuition costs for needy students . Again , the beneficiary of monopoly power is the school and not student . Implications and Conclusions <p> Most of the factors driving up college costs are natural market forces and , left to themselves , they will produce the most efficient and socially beneficial outcome . The increased value of a college degree that has led to increased demand for higher education eventually will be met by increased supply . When that happens we can expect to see tuition prices fall naturally . <p> Similarly , an overemphasis by universities on research will be corrected as students seek out schools focused on teaching . Those universities that have forsaken students through increased class size , increased tuition , or reduced professorial teaching will see their enrollment fall off and shift to schools that focus on the students . As this happens , research universities will either have to return to teaching ( which would reduce costs ) or lower their tuition to attract more students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of taxpayer desire for greater fiscal restraint . Depending on one 's view this may or may not be a problem . In either case the issues involved are too great to be covered here . It is enough to say that the residents of each state must decide for themselves their own priorities and where the cost of public higher education fits among these priorities . <p> What 's left then is federal student aid and the monopolistic power it grants to colleges and universities . Unlike the other factors affecting higher education costs , federal subsidies will not correct themselves , will not lead to an efficient and socially beneficial outcome , and -- in the end -- will hurt far more students than they will help . It is ironic that the American academy , typically the loudest voice against " capitalist excess " and an eager supporter of egalitarianism , shamelessly raises prices and otherwise profits from monopolistic practices . It should thus come as no surprise that this academic monopoly lobbies in Washington as hard or harder than anyone , because the redistributive policies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone , that is , except the student . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Survey for higher education <p> By John S. Barry <p> <p> John S.

##4000455 The greatest threat to academic freedom today comes from within . The barbarians are not at the gates ; they are inside the walls . As Benno Schmidt , then president of Yale University , said in a 1991 address : <p> The most serious problems of freedom of expression in our society today exist on our campuses . ... The assumption seems to be that the purpose of education is to induce correct opinion rather than to search for wisdom and to liberate the mind . <p> The same year , retiring Harvard president Derek Bok expressed a similar concern : <p> What universities can and must resist are deliberate , overt attempts to impose orthodoxy and suppress dissent . ... In recent years , the threat of orthodoxy has come primarily from within rather than from outside the university . <p> Since that time , others have documented the political intolerance and abuse of academic freedom on campus . The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbill University finds that over 384 colleges and universities have speech codes or sensitivity requirements that threaten academic freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus newspaper theft -- with little or no punishment for the perpetrators . <p> The political harassment of individual professors has been documented not only in such books as Lynne V. Cheney 's Telling the Truth , Dinesh D'Souza 's Illiberal Educations , and Richard Bernstein 's The Dictatorship of Virtue , but by the federal courts as well . Faculty members , even such tenured professors as Donald Silva at the University of New Hampshire , Michael Levin at the City University of New York , Graydon Snyder at the Chicago Theological Seminary , and Dean Cohen and Joseph Conlin in California , have been removed and punished , in some cases illegally , for violating the norms of political correctness . The decisions in Cohen . v. San Bernardino Valley College ( 1996 ) , Jeffries v. Harleston ( 1992 ) , and Silva v. University of New Hampshire ( 1994 ) are particularly telling in this regard . <p> That the primary threat to academic freedom would be internal is an extraordinary development . It does not seem to have been anticipated by anyone . The classic statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor is that surprising . Systematic threats to academic freedom have always been external . When the American Association of University Professors was founded , the primary threat was religious orthodoxy imposed by church hierarchies . The McCarthy era reinforced the idea that universities needed very high legal and institutional walls to shield them from severe outside pressure . The recent historical study Zealotry and Academic Freedom by Neil Hamilton , examines a number of critical periods when academic freedom was threatened . Only the current threat -- known popularly as " political correctness " -- has been internal . <p> Current rules protect academic freedom about as well as the Maginot Line protected the French . They were developed with a single-minded focus on possible external threats to academic freedom . The external marauder approaches Fortress Academe with risk . Built on the high ground of educational ideals , surrounded by the moat of " institutional autonomy , " its walls are buttressed by Tenure , Faculty Prerogatives , and Union Contracts . Like slings and arrows , charges of McCarthyism and yahooism shower down upon the reckless intruder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happens when the intellectual freedom of politically unfashionable colleagues or students is threatened by other professors , whose outrageous behavior is itself protected by tenure and " departmental autonomy " ? <p> It is important to understand how dramatically the situation has changed . Academic decisions have always been subject to faculty politics , tyrannical senior professors , and departmental cliques . No matter how hard they try to be fair , professors are only human . Their own political , intellectual , and personal tastes sometimes influence their judgment . Traditionally , professors at least believed it their duty to be fair , to set aside personal and partisan bias , and to judge colleagues ' and students ' work solely on its intellectual merit . <p> In the postmodern age , everything is stood on its head . Professors who once preached objectivity now celebrate subjectivity . The measure is not truth but power -- especially the power of one 's race , class , and gender . The aim is not to educate the young to think for themselves but to transform them into " change agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The British philosopher Jeremy Bentham once disparaged a view by calling it " nonsense on stilts . " Postmodernism is " nonsense on stilts without the stilts . " While they were knocking the props out from under everyone else , postmodernists undermined themselves as well . For the whole defense of academic freedom rests on the pursuit of truth , on the idea that it is possible to judge ideas with some degree of objectivity , rationality , and evidence . As the AAUP 's classic 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure declares , " Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth . " John Dewey put it more bluntly . " The university function is the truth-function . " <p> The postmodern attack on truth and objectivity has cut the ground out from under academic freedom . If there is no truth but only power , why protect academic freedom ? If everything is political , why should academic decisions be made by faculty rather than politicians ? <p> In fact , postmodernists are aware of these implications . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study , Betty Jean Craige argues : <p> The discipline -- and the academic world generally -- can not use the notion of academic independence from politics to support academic evaluation by academics after it has shown society 's intellectual activity to be inseparable from its political activity . <p> She concludes : <p> Since we can no longer contend that our scholarly activities ... imply no ideology , since we can no longer contend that the academy can operate free of political pressure , and since we can no longer believe that truth is not socially influenced , we must claim academic freedom and tenure on the relativistic grounds of social value : it is for the continued health of the country that our society should grant us , its academic intellectuals , the freedom to seek understanding of the world , to publish the results of our research , and to teach what we know to our students . <p> Similarly , in his contribution to The Future of Academic Freedom , Richard Rorty rejects the idea of grounding academic freedom in the pursuit of truth or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some complicated local folkways " that " insulate colleges and universities from politics and public opinion . " Such folkways should be judged , not on whether they are founded on sound principles , but " by the good they seem to be doing . " We should stop giving " epistemological " defenses for such practices but instead give " sociopolitical justifications . " Unfortunately , Rorty seems completely insensitive to the dangers inherent in changing the mission of the university from the epistemological goal of truth-seeking to the sociopolitical goal of improving society . The repression of intellectual freedom on campus today is primarily in pursuit of sociopolitical goals . <p> But this is precisely what some professors want . In his article , " There Is No Such Thing as Free Speech and It 's a Good Thing Too , " Stanley Fish argues that free speech is " not an independent value but a political prize . " If free speech principles are being used by your political opponents , you should " contest their relevance to the issue at hand ; but , if you manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a vengeance . " When someone argues against speech codes , says Fish , " the only question is the political one of which speech is going to be chilled . " ( Italics in the original . ) <p> On this view , Fish and his allies can punish dissenting faculty and students at will . If anyone off campus objects , however , they will accuse the outsiders of violating academic freedom . Fish 's view not only destroys academic freedom on campus , it undermines any reason for the rest of society to respect academic freedom and institutional autonomy . If everything is political , then , in a democracy , are n't legislators surely more qualified than English professors to run a university ? <p> The internal threat to academic freedom presents us with two pressing tasks -- one practical and one at the level of principle . At the practical level , we must find a way to defend those professors , as well as students , whose academic freedom is threatened by other professors who disagree with their views . Current notions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressors by shielding them from review . When the threat to academic freedom is internal , alumni and other friends of the university must rise in its defense . Slogans such as institutional autonomy that derive their legitimacy from the unpoliticized search for truth can not be allowed to provide a cloak for undermining academic freedom . Faculty and admistrators show little or no concern about the epidemic of campus newspaper thefts , often declining even to denounce it . On such matters of policy , alumni should vigorously enter the debate on the side of intellectual freedom . <p> The role of trustees is especially important in this regard . Trustees set policy . They have a fiduciary obligation for the academic , as well as financial , well-being of their institutions . When they fail to protect academic freedom , trustees are defaulting on their most important duty . In the past , trustees could do their duty simply by not interfering . Occasionally , they had to stand up against external threats . <p> Today , the role of trustee is more difficult and , arguably , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campus maintains a genuinely open intellectual environment when faculty and administrators fail to do so . Campus newspapers should be protected . Speakers should not be disinvited . Tenure decisions contaminated by intellectual intolerance should be reviewed and , if necessary , reconsidered . Policies should be adopted to encourage intellectual openness in departments and other campus units . <p> In the long run , we may need to reconceptualize the rules protecting academic freedom . The Maginot Line doctrine was simple : Draw a line between internal and external and defend it . This is a jurisdictional model : it does not matter what is done to the individual as long as it is done by the authorized people in the authorized way . <p> We need to explore nonjurisdictional ways to define the rights that constitute academic freedom . We do not allow a professor to be robbed , plagiarized , harassed , or discriminated against so long as it is done by his or her own department according to the procedures described in the faculty handbook . We have rules and procedures for protecting these rights from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that is not solely dependent on the inside/outside distinction , we should be able to devise procedures to protect these rights as we have others . <p> Finally , we must rise to the philosophical challenge . We must return to our intellectual moorings . We must recapture the classic understanding of intellectual freedom . We must reaffirm the search for truth that unites us in a community of free minds . Milton and Locke , Jefferson and Mill , Lovejoy and Meiklejohn taught us well . They knew that no fanaticism , no ideology , no political passion has the right to suppress free minds in the pursuit of truth . It is a lesson we dare not forget . <p> By Jerry L. Martin and Anne D.

##4000456 A university worthy of the name stands at the apex of civilization . It is a community in which rational persuasion and recourse to artistic , spiritual , and intellectual achievement takes precedence over the appeal to brute force . More than any other institution , the university exhibits the victory of persuasion over force . How ? By asserting and defending academic freedom for every member and student . Academic freedom is both a description of the ideal way of life within a university community , and a basic right claimed by all members of that community . Academic freedom helps liberate the community of scholars from domination by unqualified but powerful members of society ( or , more often these days , from other members of the academic community itself ) . It is recognized by its essential , civilized attributes : self-restraint ; respect for freedom , independence , and difference ; and delight in the high , difficult , and subtle search for truth and the art of rational inquiry and persuasion . <p> All members of the academic community are entitled to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to respect and support the conditions on which the exercise of academic freedom depends , and to respect and defend the academic freedom of others . <p> Students , no less than faculty members , have a right to academic freedom . Good students want the right to invite a provocative public figure to their campus . They want to hear all points of view and to argue with those who present them . They want to attend lectures by professors free to express their own views and not merely the safer views of others . They want the university to extend the full rights of citizenship in the academic community to all students . They want the right to experiment with ideas and movements and to gain wisdom through relatively harmless undergraduate excursions into folly . In the words of Clark Kerr : " Ideas should not be made safe for students , but students should be made safe for ideas . " <p> This essential point about who belongs to the academic community , and therefore who has a right to academic freedom , is often misunderstood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to confusion of the role and function of academic freedom with that of tenure . Where tenure functions properly , as a rising expectation of continuity or permanence ( rather than in a corrupted form , as sinecure ) , it has protected academic freedom . But tenure is clearly not necessary to its existence . How could tenure , held only by some , be the basic weapon in the defense of a right claimed by all members of the academic community ? Students and nontenured faculty have a right to academic freedom and must exercise that right to be worthy of their responsibilities . The best nontenured faculty members assume the risks of speaking their minds to the best of their knowledge and competence quite without the protection of tenure . <p> But tenure , even when elevated to the status of sinecure , fails to guarantee the exercise of academic freedom . Some professors with virtual sinecures are more concerned with salary advances or with administrative appointments or merely with the approbation of colleagues than with the faithful exercise of their academic duties . <p> Academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage is present , academic freedom will be exercised with or without tenure ; where courage is absent , the sound and vigorous exercise of academic freedom is impossible . And when tenure becomes virtually a sinecure , it encourages irresponsibility -- not academic freedom , but academic license . Thus , tenure may inhibit or corrupt , as well as enhance , the realization of academic freedom even by tenured faculty . <p> Tenure has , of course , been moderately useful in protecting established scholars in their intellectual deviance from the conformists of their discipline . But limiting the vigorous defense of academic freedom to the ranks of the tenured faculty has unfortunately left the nontenured faculty exposed . Infringement by tenured professors of the rights of the nontenured to develop their intellectual interests according to their own professional judgment -- that is , the censuring of the nontenured faculty from the standpoint of doctrinal orthodoxy as defined by the senior professors of a department-represents by far the most serious and most frequent violation of academic freedom in our colleges and universities . <p> Any professor can cite numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , departments dominated by logical positivists and linguistic analysts have frequently denied appointment or promotion to young philosophers with primarily historical or metaphysical interests , no matter how able . In psychology , experimentally oriented departments have frequently refused appointment or promotion to clinical psychologists ; clinically oriented departments have denied appointment to experimentalists ; and departments dominated by behaviorists have sometimes gotten rid of experimentalists and clinicians who would not accept the reductionist formulas of behaviorism . Political science departments have frequently been captured by Marxists or Straussians who attempt to impose an orthodoxy on the members of their departments . And English departments all too frequently reject creative writers -- novelists , poets , playwrights -- who do not produce the usual critical cliches for the usual scholarly journals . <p> Lately a new test has been imposed in many departments : submission to the intellectual orthodoxies that go broadly by the name of " deconstructionism . " Even so profoundly gifted a literary critic as Christopher Ricks may find himself ostracized by colleagues in the English department if he proves a heretic in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a description of the demands sometimes made by senior professors of their younger colleagues . Too often the senior professors demand nothing less than conformity or deference to their own prejudices . Anything so exciting or dignified as the resistance of Newtonian physicists to the disturbing implications for Newtonian theory of the Michelson-Morley experiment is rarely involved . Rather , I have in mind the all-too-common decision by senior professors to remove an able young person whose outstanding teaching and scholarly promise expose their own deficiencies . Resentment is not merely an academic vice , but the academic vice . <p> If we recognize that the guild masters impose doctrinal orthodoxy , and that senior professors demand deference from their juniors , we must then recognize that these are genuine infringements of academic freedom , and that academic freedom is severely restricted for all but the most courageous or naturally conformist of the nontenured faculty . The American Association of University Professors has never defended academic freedom from this common and more subtle coercion practiced by academics themselves or even recognized that such coercion , though a common occurrence , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , a place for doctrinal bias . A school of theology , for example , has every right to restrict faculty appointments to believers . But if a department or college exercises the right to a doctrinal bias in the pursuit of its educational goals , it should openly admit the restrictions it places on academic freedom and inform faculty members and the general public of these limitations at the time of their appointment . <p> How are nontenured faculty -- the younger faculty with minimal claims to tenure -- to be protected from intellectual censorship ? I acknowledge the difficulties inherent in the problem . It seems clear , nevertheless , that some review procedure , ensuring that assessments include responsible but non-mainstream points of view , is essential in protecting younger faculty from the doctrinal censorship of their own colleagues . In such reviews , administrators have an essential role to play . A vigorous dean can often prevent the dismissal of an able young scholar , simply by insisting that members of his department justify their decision . By appealing to the national and international community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars and critics outside the department and the university itself and by presenting student evaluations of his or her teaching , the dean can see that academic justice is done . The dean in possession of such evidence is in a position to accept the recommendation of the department , to persuade the department to change its decision , or to be justified in overruling it . <p> Because of the central role of the faculty in establishing the quality of an institution , it is the highest obligation of the administration to minimize mistakes in granting or denying tenure . Mistakes in either direction impose serious losses on students . <p> On the other hand , there is no reason to defend the intellectual novelty of individuals who can not present deviant ideas in a way that is reasonably convincing to fair-minded and competent critics . But in the appointment of faculty , we can rarely expect to be absolutely certain of the soundness of any decision , for the recognition of talent is an aleatory science . <p> What conclusion should we draw from this ? We must recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal and effective service . We must also recognize the institutional need to remain solvent , innovative , and educationally effective . Administrators and faculties must develop a tenure policy and procedures that serve these essential needs . If the AAUP wishes ever again to play a relevant role in academic life , it will have to recognize the folly of its misadventure with trade unionism and reestablish the morally authoritative , almost judicial , position once held . Failing this , it can play no part . <p> The turmoil of the late 1960s and early 1970s made it clear that the chief threat to universities is not from outside assaults on academic freedom . Today , there is virtually no interference or restriction on the actions or opinions of professors by politicians , boards of trustees , or influential business leaders . <p> Sadly , it is now more likely that attempts to suppress the academic freedom of a professor or a visiting speaker will come from within the campus . Led by those who have been called " tenured radicals , " many universities adopt repressive speech codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and faculty on such campuses disrupt speakers whose views they oppose , they do so without risk of being disciplined . Only in dealing with conservatively oriented student publications do such administrations take action , and then only to suppress , rather than defend , freedom of thought and expression . <p> The major threat to academic freedom today is from its misuse by professors and students who engage in what can only be accurately described as academic license . When the exercise of academic freedom degenerates into academic license through a professor 's , or a student 's , disregard for the rational procedures essential to the search for truth , which is the work of the scholar , academic freedom is lost and the integrity of the university is compromised . The price of academic freedom , therefore , is eternal vigilance . <p> By John Silber <p> <p> John Silber is chancellor of Boston University in Massachusetts . <p> 
##4000061 Section : Features Elegant experiments confirm long-held theory of cellular aging <p> They have found a way to re-verse the aging process , " Tom Brokaw proclaimed on the NBC Nightly News on January 14 , 1998 . Brokaw was referring to experimental results from researchers at Geron Corporation , in Menlo Park , California , and at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas . The work showed that providing normal somatic cells with the enzyme telomerase extends the length of their chromosome tips ( telomeres ) and renders them immortal , yet healthy . <p> Although the reported results were not quite as dramatic as the fountain of youth that Brokaw evoked , they did confirm the long-held theory that telomeres function as a cell division clock , ticking down time as they shorten . And as years of discoveries coalesce into the burgeoning field of telomere biology , potential medical applications are already on the horizon in such diverse areas as diagnosing cancer , slowing degenerative diseases of aging , and making organ transplants safer . <p> Human telomeres are made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that telomeres , long thought to protect chromosomal integrity in some vague way , erode with each cell division , ultimately reaching a threshold length that signals division to cease . For many somatic cell types , an end to cell division means not death , but rather the onset of a defined differentiated , or specialized , state . Telomere shortening seems to be the normal default option for most somatic cells . By contrast , cells in the germline and in highly proliferative tissues , such as bone marrow and the epithelium of the small intestine , continually replenish their chromosome tips . So do most cancer cells , which are notorious for having long telomeres and active telomerase . <p> Chromosomes keep from shrinking in some cells , including cancer cells , thanks to telomerase , a ribonucleoprotein with three components : a catalytic protein portion with reverse transcriptase activity , an RNA template , and an associated protein called telomeric repeat binding factor . The RNA template contains the sequence CCCUAA , the reverse complement of the TTAGGG DNA that forms the telomere . Reverse transcriptase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template . And the telomeric repeat binding factor brings the chromosome tip , the RNA template , and the reverse transcriptase physically together , so that six-nucleotide DNA repeats can be added to the chromosome end . This cellular machinery is essentially a built-in telomere factory that is turned on only at certain times and in certain cells . <p> The sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes , called telomeres , are composed of hundreds or thousands of short DNA repeats . The telomeres of the human fetal lung fibroblast chromosomes shown here , which are made up of repeats of the DNA sequence TTAGGG , were stained with a fluorescent probe . Thoughts on telomeres <p> The 1980s and 1990s have seen the elaboration and dovetailing of the molecular details of the telomere story . But the saga began many years earlier , with several seemingly unrelated observations made by some of the heavyweights in the history of biology . <p> Cytogeneticists first noted the importance of telomeres in the first half of the century , when they observed that chromosomes that lost their tips stuck together and vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telomeres in Drosophila in 1938 , and Barbara McClintock did so a year later in corn . In 1961 , Leonard Hayflick contributed information that would prove to be pivotal in telomere biology : He found that cells in culture divide a finite number of times , usually 40-60 . This number became known as the " Hayflick limit . " <p> A decade after the discovery of the Hayflick limit , Alexey Olovnikov , a senior researcher at the Institute of Biochemical Physics and the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow , proposed that telomere shrinkage is a countdown to cellular senescence . In 1973 he published " A theory of marginotomy : The incomplete copying of template margin in enzymatic synthesis of polynucleotides and biological significance of the phenomenon , " in the Journal of Theoretical Biology . What that mouthful means is that chromosome tips whittle down because DNA polymerase can not copy the very end of one of the replicating strands , the so-called lagging strand . Consequently , the chromosomes would shorten at each round of replication . Olovnikov wrote : " Marginotomy causes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more shortened end-genes .... After the exhaustion of telogenes the cells become aged . " Olovnikov explains that , as he proposed in his 1973 paper , " The telomere shortening could serve as a counting mechanism , which , like a molecular bookkeeper , counts the number of cell doublings already performed . " A bacterium avoids the problem of shrinking chromosome tips , he also noted at the time , because its chromosome is a circle . <p> Soon after Olovnikov 's prescient hypotheses were published , James Watson published similar ideas . However , Watson 's description of the " end-replication problem " referred to the replication of the ends of linear bacteriophage DNA , and not to aging . Nevertheless , " the telomere field has always cited Watson , since his was the prediction of chromosome shortening that people in the United States knew about , and were testing , " relates Carol Greider , of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . " I did not know of Olovnikov when I discovered telomerase , nor did others , " Greider says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aware of his work . <p> But Calvin Harley , now vice president for research at Geron , knew of Olovnikov 's work and spread the word by describing and referencing it in a 1991 publication in Mutation Research . " Experiments have validated his predictions , " Harley says . " But Olovnikov did n't know the biochemistry of DNA replication very well and could n't describe it . He was thinking about aging . Conversely , James Watson carefully defined the end-replication problem , and wrote nothing about aging . " Many telomere biologists now concur that both of these researchers deserve credit for identifying the phenomenon of telomere shrinkage . Experiments reveal how telomeres shrink <p> Olovnikov suggested that an enzyme might maintain chromosome ends . " But molecular tools were needed to prove this idea , " Harley says . A living system in which to explore telomere behavior came in the form of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila . This pond organism provides an enriched system for probing telomeres because when it forms sex cells , its chromosomes fragment and then replicate , generating about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell has just 92 telomeres . ) In 1978 , Joseph Gall and Elizabeth Blackburn , then at Yale University , found that telomeres in T. thermophila consist of many short DNA repeats . By the mid-1980s , Blackburn , at the University of California-Berkeley , and Greider , then a graduate student in Blackburn 's lab , had discovered and described the enzyme that extends telomeres , naming it telomerase . <p> Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that keeps the ends of replicating chromosomes from shrinking in continually dividing cells , such as those in the the germline and in highly proliferative tissues . This cartoon depicts the components of telomerase : the RNA component , shown as a pink ribbonlike structure , which includes a template region ( shown as AUCCCA ) that binds to the single-stranded portion of the telomeric DNA repeats ( shown as TAGGGT ) ; the catalytic component , a reverse transcriptase ( yellow oval ) that copies the RNA into DNA ; and telomerase-associated proteins ( orange ovals ) . <p> In 1986 , Howard Cooke , at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that the tips were shorter in somatic cells than in sperm cells . By 1989 , Robert Moyzis and coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory identified the human telomere repeat as TTAGGG , and in 1990 , Harley , Greider , and Bruce Futcher found that the telomeres of human somatic cells shorten as the number of cell divisions increases , although those of cancer cells do not . <p> In the early 1990s , several observations solidified the link between telomere shortening and aging . In 1992 , Richard Allsopp and colleagues at Geron reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( 89 : 10114-10118 ) that children with the rapid-aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome have unusually short telomeres . In 1993 , shorter-than-normal telomeres were found in people with Down 's syndrome , and 3 years later , they were also found in people with Werner syndrome , an adult-onset rapid-aging disorder . Cells from people with these disorders literally race through their allotted divisions , accelerating life at the cellular level as the body ages ahead of schedule . ( People with Down 's syndrome have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . ) <p> In 1995 , Geron researchers and Greider 's group at Cold Spring Harbor reported in Science ( 269 : 1236-1241 ) that they had cloned the RNA template component of human telomerase -- an 11-nucleotide sequence that includes the critical CCCUAA that encodes the telomere repeat . They and others subsequently measured the amount of RNA template in various tissues , finding greater abundance in tumor cell lines and germline tissues than in somatic cells . <p> Researchers also probed the origins of the telomerase system by searching for clues in reverse transcriptase , an enzyme that is not unique to telomerase . RNA viruses use reverse transcriptase to copy themselves into DNA in host cells , and retrotransposons also use the enzyme . A retrotransposon is a piece of moveable DNA that transcribes itself into an RNA intermediate when it changes location , and then reverse transcribes itself back into DNA when it inserts at a new location in a chromosome . <p> The fruit fly has retrotransposons rather than typical telomeres at its chromosome tips . " If a retrotransposable element wanted to use as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively take over the role of telomerase . This is what has apparently occurred in Drosophila melanogaster , " says Thomas Eickbush , of the University of Rochester , in New York . He discussed the evolutionary relationship between retrotransposons and telomerase -- that is , which came first -- in 1997 in Science ( 277 : 911-913 ) . Eickbush suggested that , in early eukaryotes , telomeres originated from retrotransposons , which a retrovirus perhaps supplied , and that the unusual telomeres of Drosophila reflect a more recent takeover of somatic cells by retrotransposons that preferentially insert at chromosome ends . Revealing the role of telomerase <p> Two key experiments reported in late 1997 and early 1998 further strengthened the connection between telomere shortening and cell senescence , while indicating that the enzyme 's role in cancer causation is complex . One investigation removed telomerase in knockout mice and observed the onset of senescence . The other work , which made the nightly news , added telomerase to human cells in culture and demonstrated extension of the cells ' proliferative lifetime . <p> Mice in which telomerase was eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telomerase RNA component gave Greider and her colleagues at Cold Spring Harbor , the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City , and Quest Diagnostics , Inc. , in Teterboro , New Jersey , the opportunity to ask what life would be like without telomerase . The researchers created these knockout mice , then observed them and analyzed several highly proliferative tissues through six generations ( Cell 91 : 25-29 and Nature 392 : 569-574 ) . <p> As the researchers had expected , the knockout mice did not fare well . Overall , the lack of telomerase compromised chromosome stability and the integrity of cells that normally divide often . Their telomeres became shorter than normal , their chromosomes broke , and some nonhomologous chromosomes fused to form translocations . The animals ' fertility plummeted , reproductive organs shrank , and highly proliferative tissues , such as testis , spleen , and bone marrow , degenerated . These results therefore confirmed that telomerase is important for maintaining highly renewable tissues . Interestingly , cells cultured from the knockout mice could still become cancerous . This result showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is consistent with the fact that cancer development is often a multistep process requiring the participation of several genes . <p> In the 16 January 1998 issue of Science , Harley and colleagues at Geron , and Woodring Wright , Jerry Shay , and colleagues at Southwestern Medical Center , reported the effects of adding the gene that encodes human telomerase reverse transcriptase to normal human cells in culture . These experiments used cells important in human disease and aging -- retinal pigment epithelium , fibroblasts , and vascular endothelium . Slowed metabolism of retinal epithelium can cause age-related macular degeneration . Fibroblasts in aging skin make less collagen and elastin and more collagenase , causing wrinkles . And overgrowth of the endothelium that forms capillaries and lines blood vessel interiors contributes to atherosclerosis . <p> The results of adding telomerase to these cells were striking -- the cells regained their proliferative potential , ignoring the Hayflick limits . " For the first time , we showed that if you highly specifically modulate telomere dynamics , you can see the predicted effect on cell lifespan . It proves the causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fact that most cancer cells have active telomerase and long telomeres led to the hypothesis that telomerase is required for tumor growth , with telomere shortening in normal somatic cells having a tumor-suppressing function . However , although many of the cells to which the researchers added telomerase reverse transcriptase churned out the enzyme at levels similar to those of cancer cells , signs of cancer have not appeared , and the cells seem normal despite ignoring the Hayflick limit . " After a year , the cells have not progressed to cancer . They have normal karyotypes , pass all the cell cycle checkpoints , and do not cause tumors when injected into nude mice which lack immunity and are used to test tumor-forming potential . They divide at a reasonable rate , and they have a youthful appearance , " Shay reports . <p> The fact that the telomerase-bolstered human cells do not become cancerous , and that telomerase-deficient mice can still get cancer , is not as contradictory as it might seem . It just shows that telomerase is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 20 years , it is that a lot of different insults are required to transform a normal cell to a cancerous cell . By simply adding telomerase , you 're only affecting one factor . As long as the other pathways are intact , there is no reason to expect an increase in cancer incidence , " Shay says . Telomerase may enable a cell to ignore the Hayflick limit , or directly or indirectly destabilize chromosomes , which in turn could activate an oncogene or deactivate a tumor suppressor gene that is part of the pathway to cancer . " Now we have to see how telomerase fits into all the other aspects of cancer that are controlled by other genes , " Shay adds . Eclectic applications <p> With the components of telomerase clearly identified , and the enzyme 's function elegantly demonstrated , the next stage in the continuing tale of telomeres will be developing clinical applications . <p> Because telomerase is critical to maintaining cellular stability and cell division , altering this enzyme 's activity may have varied uses . In basic research using cell cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human cells that are not cancerous , but would proliferate , " Shay says . In clinical applications , new understanding of telomerase function could lead to more sensitive cancer diagnostics and make transplants safer , treat AIDS , and perhaps even rejuvenate aging tissues . <p> Measuring telomerase levels , for example , can be used to track cancer progression . In one study , 12 of 16 children with neuroblastoma and high telomerase activity in their cancer cells died , whereas only 2 of 60 children with low telomerase activity died . " About 85 percent of tumors contain this marker , and use of telomerase as a cancer marker is already a routine procedure in some oncological centers , " Olovnikov says . A polymerase chain reaction-based assay called TRAP ( telomeric repeat amplification protocol ) can spot a single telomerase-producing cancer cell among 10,000 healthy cells , and a technique using fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) and flow cytometry , called " flow-FISH , " can measure telomere length . Clinicians may someday manipulate telomerase level or activity as a way to treat cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worked out first . <p> New understanding of telomere biology may also solve a vexing problem with bone marrow transplants : Something about the transplant process seems to rev up the mitotic clock , accelerating the aging of donor cells . Robert Wynn and colleagues at The Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in Manchester , UK , reported in the 17 January 1998 issue of The Lancet that telomeres in transplanted bone marrow cells are shorter than those in normal bone marrow cells in either the donor or the recipient . Rosario Notaro and coworkers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City reported in the 9 December 1997 issue of PNAS that the more cells that are transplanted , the less the telomeres shrink . It is as if transplanting only a few cells stresses them in their effort to repopulate the recipient 's marrow , and in response the cells age faster than normal , the researchers suggest . <p> The rapid aging of transplanted tissue may explain the increased risk that bone marrow transplant recipients face of developing blood cancers years later , Shay suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow transplant is supposed to be all stem cells , but this is not completely so . Ten to 15 years later , a recipient may develop leukemia because the transplanted cells did not have the proliferative capacity of a true stem cell , " he says . Inserting telomerase into the donor bone marrow cells before the transplant may help to extend the cells ' lifetimes . <p> A similar approach of extending cellular life with telomerase might be used to treat AIDS , but in this case the patient 's own cells would be used . The human body has enough hematopoietic ( blood-forming ) stem cells to last a lifetime , but as HIV kills more and more T cells , the stem-cell population has to work overtime to replace them . The hematopoietic system may eventually shut down . " Telomere biology might be part of the AIDS story , " Shay says . Instead of transplanting bone marrow from donors , hematopoietic stem cells could be taken from a person at the early stage of HIV infection . The cells would have their telomeres extended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls as the infection progresses , he or she can receive the stored stem cells , which may replenish the T-cell supply . <p> Telomere biology may also be exploited to address signs of aging . A blast of telomerase might keep fibroblasts in the skin 's dermis layer at a more youthful stage , in which they synthesize collagen and elastin rather than collagenase . Reactivating collagen and elastin production from within might be an alternative to injecting bovine collagen to plump out wrinkles . <p> Further in the future is the possibility of using autologous ( self ) cell implants to renew selected tissues that degenerate with age , approaching Tom Brokaw 's view of telomere biology as providing a fountain of youth . Olovnikov speculates that " such cells will be treated in vitro with telomerase activity-containing viral vectors . Artificially elongating their telomeres will preserve these cells ' ' normalcy , ' so they will not senesce . Such cells might be used to renew the inner parts of blood vessels , cells of the pancreas , or even normal postmitotic cells such as cardiocytes and neurons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the future . As Shay sums up , " We ca n't make people live forever . There 's nothing wrong with fantasizing , but there are too many interesting short-term benefits of the research to focus on . If we can develop tissue-specific therapies , if we can correct certain problems , then maybe we will live longer .

##4000066 Section : Education <p> We recently conducted an in-formal survey of 222 students in various biology classes at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville . All were biology majors , ranging from freshmen to seniors , and all had been taught about the fern life cycle at some point in their academic careers . We asked the following question : " If you have ever been taught anything about ferns , please indicate two or three things that distinguish them from other plants . " Forty-two percent of the respondents indicated that they remembered little or nothing about ferns , 40% said that ferns reproduce by spores , and 21% remembered something distinctive about ferns : their fronds ( leaves ) or the fact that they form fiddleheads . Fewer than 10% mentioned anything about free-living haploid gametophytes , diploid vascular sporophytes , swimming sperm , or alternation of generations . The results , although perhaps not representative of all institutions or settings , were not surprising . This level of understanding is what one might expect from someone with only a passing interest in ferns and no formal education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to educate these students ? Did they teach them the wrong thing ? Does anyone really need to know anything about ferns anyway ? <p> It is not surprising that students have such a minimal level of knowledge and understanding , considering that most students do not find plants in general very interesting . In many students ' eyes , plants simply do not do as much as other , more familiar organisms or those that " move around and do things . " Lack of interest in plants may be especially true for ferns and other " lower " plants because they are less important in students ' everyday lives than " higher " plants , such as angiosperms . This lack of familiarity is no doubt reinforced by the difficulties of mastering the high-content biology curricula that confront most students . <p> Given this situation , is it necessary to even attempt to include organisms such as ferns in the biology curriculum ? We contend that it is both necessary and worthwhile because ferns uniquely demonstrate basic phenomena that are absolutely essential for an adequate understanding of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can work well in the classroom and provide enough interest to motivate students . In this article , we introduce the use of C-FernTM , a cultivar of the fern genus Ceratopteris , as a dynamic and captivating organism that really does move around and do things in the classroom . C-Fern in the classroom <p> Although C-Fern can be used as a superb example of a plant life cycle and alternation of generations , its potential goes far beyond these uses : It can be used to expose students to many broadly applicable biological principles ( Renzaglia and Warne 1995 , Renzaglia et al . 1995 ) . In addition , C-Fern is useful in a variety of classroom situations , from the traditional laboratory to full inquiry-based approaches and independent student research . Using low-power microscopy , students can observe and discover growth and development from a quiescent single-celled spore , an active sexual process involving pheromonal control of sexual differentiation , differentiation of sexual organs and vegetative structures , release of large numbers of swimming sperm , chemotaxis , fertilization , and early embryo development -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . C-Fern can also be used to demonstrate population dynamics and to present basic Mendelian principles in a unique fashion . It is an easy , effective , user-friendly , inexpensive , resilient , reliable organism that can be used at a number of educational levels . <p> C-Fern is a derived cultivar of the homosporous fern Ceratopteris richardii ( Hickok and Warne 1998 ) . According to recent molecular and morphological analyses , Ceratopteris belongs to the family Pteridaceae ( Hasebe et al . 1995 , Pryer et al . 1995 ) , although it was previously placed in the Parkeriaceae ( Lloyd 1974 ) and even the Schizeaceae ( Mickel 1974 ) . Known by the common names of water sprite or triangle water fern , Ceratopteris is an aquatic to semiaquatic plant that is widely distributed in the tropics of both hemispheres and is frequently cultivated as an aquarium plant . <p> Ceratopteris has been used successfully for a number of years in basic research applications ( Hickok et al . 1987 , 1995 ) . These have ranged from studies of the responses of the wild type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warne et al . 1995 ) to continuing investigations into the nature of the genetic control over sexual differentiation ( e.g. , Warne and Hickok 1991 , Banks et al . 1993 , Banks 1997 ) . Advantages for its use in research include a relatively short life cycle that can be completed under highly controlled conditions ; a rapid differentiation process in the haploid generation , which results in spore germination and development of sexually mature gametophytes within 2 weeks ; efficient mutagenesis and selection techniques ; and simple genetics , which result from the ability of haploid gametophytes to self-fertilize , yielding , in a single generation , sporophytes that are homozygous at every locus . These and other features also make C-Fern exceptionally useful in teaching applications . Major developmental events <p> Major C-Fern developmental events are depicted in Figure 1 . The single-celled haploid spores , which have an average diameter of approximately 120 MUm , are quite large in comparison to those of most ferns and are easy to observe and handle . Dry spores can lie dormant for many years . However , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spore imbibition requires approximately 24 hours and is followed by the initiation of spore germination , which is a light-requiring event that is normally controlled by phytochrome and other photoreceptors ( Cooke et al . 1987 ) . A mutant stock , dkg1 , that does not require light for the initiation of spore germination is also available ( Cooke et al . 1995 ) . <p> Figure 1 . Major C-Fern developmental events . The sporophyte is not necessarily shown on the page at the same scale as the spore and gametophytes . Whereas the spore is approximately 120 MUm in diameter , the sporophyte can vary from actual size shown on the page to many times larger , depending on culture conditions and age . <p> Cultures that are free of contamination are easy to initiate and maintain . Axenic cultures , although not essential for successful growth and observations , allow experimentation without the uncontrolled effects on growth and differentiation that may be associated with fungal or bacterial contaminants . Large numbers of spores can be sown on petri dishes containing a simple mineral nutrient agar ( Hickok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and rapidly , but presterilized spores are also available commercially . The lack of sugars and other carbon sources in the nutrient medium is an advantage in maintaining uncontaminated cultures for long-term manipulations and observations . Cultures maintained near 28 degreesC under continuous lighting ( **26;609;TOOLONG dot ) msup-2 ( multiplication dot ) ssup-1 ) show optimum rates of development . For rapid development , temperature is more critical than light fluence . This dependence allows convenient temperature regulation of cultures by adjusting the distance between the cultures and the light source . Keeping culture plates within a plastic greenhouse tray covered with a transparent dome helps control temperature ( internal temperature can be more than 2 degreesC higher than external temperatures ) and moderates fluctuations in humidity to reduce culture drying . <p> Under optimal conditions , germination occurs 3-4 days from starting the cultures ( DFS ) . At 4-5 DFS , small green tongue-shaped gametophytes with clear , threadlike rhizoids can be seen emerging from the cracked spore coat . These young gametophytes are sensitive to light . If cultures are grown under adequate light , gametophytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . However , if cultures are placed in the dark following light initiation of spore germination , a dramatic etiolation response occurs . The basal cells of the developing gametophyte grow up to several times their normal length , and the normal expansion of other cells in the tip of the gametophyte is inhibited ( Murata et al . 1997 ) . A mutant stock , det30 , is available that shows a much reduced etiolation response . The distinct responses of wild-type spores dramatically demonstrate the requirement of light for both normal spore germination and early gametophyte development . Interestingly , when older gametophytes are transferred to dark conditions , they do not show the etiolation response . <p> Sexual type is determined at 3-5 DFS , although distinct phenotypic differences are not evident until 7 DFS or later ( Banks et al . 1993 ) . The presence of both sexual types within a population is caused by asynchrony in spore germination . Gametophytes that germinate early and develop first become hermaphroditic , whereas later-developing gametophytes become male . This sexual distinction is regulated by a pheromone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences the development of later-germinating gametophytes so that they become male . Although the C-Fern antheridiogen has not been isolated and structurally identified , studies using inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis have demonstrated that this compound may share a biosynthetic relationship to gibberellin ( Warne and Hickok 1989 ) . Several mutant lines with altered sexual differentiation responses have been identified ( Warne et al . 1988 , Banks 1997 ) ; these include the her mutants , which show insensitivity to antheridiogen and develop only as hermaphrodites , and a newly identified him mutant , with a highly increased male response . <p> By 10 DFS , hermaphrodites and males are clearly different in a number of features . Males lack a meristem and show determinate growth , whereas hermaphrodites possess a meristem ( called the notch meristem ) and grow indeterminately . Males are thumb shaped , approximately 1 mm long , and are covered by many small round antheridia on their surface . Each antheridium consists of spermatogenous cells ( giving rise to 16 sperm at maturity ) surrounded by a cup-shaped basal cell , a doughnut-shaped ring cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By contrast , hermaphrodites are obliquely heart-shaped , 2-3 mm in diameter , and possess both antheridia and archegonia . An archegonium consists of cells that form a short neck that protrudes from the surface of the essentially two-dimensional gametophyte and an egg cell that is located within the gametophyte at the base of the neck . Archegonia are located directly behind the notch meristem , and the few antheridia of hermaphrodites are located initially on the margins and subsequently throughout the body of the gametophyte . <p> Both male and hermaphrodite gametophytes reach initial sexual maturity at approximately 10 DFS . If water is added to a mature culture , many sperm are released from the antheridia and swim about actively in search of a receptive archegonium containing an egg . Sperm show a positive chemotactic response to the cellular contents that are discharged from the neck of a receptive archegonium , typically one per hermaphroditic gametophyte . Large masses of sperm rapidly locate and surround the receptive archegonium . Fertilization results in a diploid zygote , which develops rapidly into a young embryo . By the third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a successful fertilization , the notch meristem of the hermaphrodite ceases to divide and dedifferentiates into vegetative tissue . Further cell expansion modifies the shape of the gametophyte somewhat , but no further growth occurs . This dedifferentiation response is very rapid and most likely involves a signaling pathway between the gametophyte and the zygote or young embryo . This signal is effective only within a fertilized gametophyte and does not affect meristem activity or subsequent development in adjacent unfertilized gametophytes within a culture . Embryo development progresses rapidly and continuously to the formation of initial leaves and roots of the sporophyte , during which time the gametophyte gradually senesces and dies . <p> Young sporophytes with well-formed leaves and roots can be easily grown under a variety of conditions -- in a greenhouse , in mini-terraria made from plastic drink bottles containing a commercial potting mix , or even submersed or floating in a freshwater aquarium . Sporophytes show a heteroblastic progression of leaf development , beginning with small entire leaves and gradually progressing to more highly divided leaves that ultimately become fertile . This progression can be modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fertile leaves contain sporangia on their inrolled lower margins ; within each sporangium , four large spore mother cells undergo meiosis to produce a total of 16 haploid spores . Viable spores can be obtained from mature sporophytes at 90 DFS or later , depending on culture conditions . At maturity , spore production is continuous . Because C-Fern lacks the persistent rhizome that characterizes many perennial ferns , it is shorter lived and grows more like an annual . Mature sporophytes can be maintained in the greenhouse for well over 12 months , and the presence of small vegetative buds that produce plantlets on leaves allows an individual sporophyte to be propagated indefinitely . Student-based applications for the classroom <p> C-Fern development provides many opportunities to illustrate a variety of fundamental biological principles . It also provides an accessible and dynamic representation of a plant life cycle . The use of C-Fern is especially well suited to an inquiry process , in which students devise questions and seek answers to them without being told the " right " answer ahead of time . Classroom use is enhanced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Materials , supplies , and extensive written and electronic support materials are easily available ( see box page 1036 ) . The following examples of specific applications demonstrate the broad utility and flexibility of this plant in education . <p> Development . What controls sexual differentiation in gametophytes ? After students have discovered that there are two sexual types within a population of C-Fern gametophytes , the questions of " Why ? " and " How ? " arise naturally . Figures 2 and 3 illustrate a series of experiments , with representative results , that were designed entirely by students enrolled in an undergraduate course in which C-Fern was used as an unknown organism that students were asked to investigate ( Claudia Melear , Leslie Hickok , Thomas Warne , and John Goodlaxson , unpublished manuscript ) . It is important to emphasize that these experiments were student initiated , with little input from the instructors . The course was a realistic experience in learning the process of science . It took several weeks of observation and testing before the final versions of the experiments depicted in Figures 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improve on , and carry out multiple experiments within a short time was a great advantage in this approach . Moreover , in using this approach , the process of discovery was considered by the educators and eventually by the students to be much more important than the ultimate answers . <p> As detailed above , sexual type in C-Fern gametophytes is not under direct genetic control , even though within a large population a consistent ratio of male and hermaphrodites can be observed . Without prior knowledge , how could one distinguish between genetic and environmental control ? One approach is shown in Figure 2 . The multispore culture at the top was the context within which students initially became aware of the two sexual types . Subsequent experiments devised with pair and isolate cultures led them to the conclusion that control of sexual type was not genetic and that it was instead determined by some sort of interaction that was occurring in the populations . That is , because spore isolates always resulted in hermaphrodites , all spores must have the capacity to develop into hermaphrodites ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mixed results in the pair cultures suggested that some environmental variable was important . <p> Figure 2 . Student-designed experiment to determine if control of sexual type in gametophytes is genetic . Multispore ( top ) , pair ( middle ) , and isolate ( bottom ) cultures were established with spores and scored for gametophyte sexual types after 10 days . Gametophytes are represented as obliquely heart-shaped hermaphrodites and smaller thumb-shaped males . X indicates that an outcome was not observed . Relative responses are represented by relative numbers of each sexual type . <p> Figure 3 . Student-designed experiment ( bioassay ) to determine if control of gametophyte sexual type is regulated by a chemical signal . Petri dishes were not preinoculated ( top ) or were preinoculated with a mature male ( middle ) or a hermaphrodite ( bottom ) . After 10 days , the preinoculate was removed and spores were sown . Sexual types were scored after 10 additional days . Gametophytes are represented as obliquely heart-shaped hermaphrodites and smaller thumb-shaped males . Relative responses are represented by relative numbers of each sexual type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the two sexual types , the students hypothesized that it might be a chemical signal -- but from where , and with what specific effect ? Figure 3 illustrates their experimental approach to addressing these questions . Because the cultures were axenic , the signal was most likely coming from the gametophytes themselves . Thus , by pre-inoculating cultures with mature gametophytes , the students could determine if the male or hermaphrodite , or both , was the source of the signal . From these experiments , they concluded that a chemical signal was coming predominantly from hermaphrodites and that it influenced the differentiation of later-germinating spores and young gametophytes so that they developed as males . In essence , these students had developed a rather sophisticated bioassay to test for the presence of this suspected chemical agent . They did not use the term bioassay , nor were they told what experiment to do or how to conduct it . Again , it was a process of pure discovery by inquiry . <p> Population effects and interactions . With the information and understanding gained from these initial experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What effects do density and other environmental variables have on development ? " Representative experiments designed to provide answers are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 . These examples do not show actual experiments that were designed by students ; instead , they represent generalized types of experiments that could come out of extended student inquiry . <p> Figure 4 . A representative experiment to determine the effect of population density on gametophyte sex ratio ( i.e. , on mating strategy ) . Cultures were established at different spore densities , and gametophyte sexual types were scored after 10 days . Gametophytes are represented as obliquely heart-shaped hermaphrodites and smaller thumb-shaped males . The size of the male and hermaphrodite symbols at right indicate the relative proportions of these sexual types . <p> Figure 5 . A representative experiment to determine the effect of population density on sporophyte growth ( competition ) . Cultures were established at different densities ( as in Figure 4 ) ; after 10 days , gametophytes were watered to produce a population of sporophytes . Gametophytes are represented as obliquely heart-shaped hermaphrodites and smaller thumb-shaped males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a y-shaped vascular strand ) attached to hermaphroditic gametophytes . Average sizes ( lengths ) of the first leaves at each density were determined 14 days after water was added ( i.e. , after fertilization ) . <p> Figure 4 illustrates an experiment to determine the effect of culture density on gametophyte sex ratio , or , put another way , on mating strategy within populations . By establishing cultures with different spore densities and then determining the resulting proportions of males and hermaphrodites , it becomes evident that high population densities result in relatively more males , whereas lower densities result in a higher proportion of hermaphrodites . The observations can be easily extended to natural situations and to evolutionary considerations . Figure 5 is an extension of the type of experiment depicted in Figure 4 , requiring only that the cultures of different densities be watered to allow fertilizations and to generate populations of sporophytes . This experiment looks at the effect of population density on sporophyte development and illustrates the concept of competition for limited nutrients . In all of the above examples , student data collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises . This hands-on involvement is facilitated by the ability to work with large populations within a small space ( standard density is more than 300 gametophytes in a 60 mm petri dish ) and with minimal equipment . <p> Genetics . To a teacher , basic principles of Mendelian genetics may be simple and elegant , but students rarely feel the same way . The use of C-Fern to demonstrate the principle of segregation and the result of random fertilizations can provide students with a better understanding of a genetic concept as basic as the use of a Punnett square . Because some traits can be observed in both the gametophyte and sporophyte generations , C-Fern can be used in an active exercise that demonstrates a " living " Punnett square . Figure 6 illustrates such an exercise with the cp ( polka dot ) mutation . This recessive mutation results in a visually striking phenotype associated with the clumping of plastids around the nucleus , which gives a distinct polka dot appearance to cells in both haploid gametophyte ( cp ) and diploid sporophyte ( cp/cp ) tissue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an F1 hybrid sporophyte ( Cp/cp ) , students can directly describe the gametophytic phenotypes and determine the segregation ratio resulting directly from meiosis in the F1 hybrid sporophyte . The outcome of random fertilizations that produce the F2 sporophyte generation after water is added to the culture can then be predicted . Subsequent analysis of the F2 population ratio , with F1 gametophytes still attached , provides a solid visual exercise in both hypothesis formation and testing . <p> Figure 6 . A " living " Punnett square generated from an F1 hybrid heterozygous for the cp ( polka dot ) mutation . Both hermaphrodites ( obliquely heart-shaped ) and males ( smaller and thumb-shaped ) serve as sperm sources ( top ) ; only hermaphrodites serve as egg sources ( left ) . F1-derived gametophytes show 1:1 ( Cp:cp ) segregation . F2 sporophytes show 3:1 ( Cp/-:cp/cp ) segregation and are represented as single first leaves ( each with a y-shaped vascular strand ) attached to hermaphroditic F1-derived gametophytes . Wild-type F2 sporophytes attached to polka dot F1 gametophytes are heterozygous ( Cp/cp ) . <p> Biochemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete understanding of biology . Yet many students , especially at the introductory biology level , see little relationship between the two except for the required memorization of structures , pathways , and cycles . Figure 7 shows the chemical structures of the stereoisomers L-and D-malate ( L-malate is the common Krebs cycle intermediate ) . Although the concept of stereoisomers and biological relevance can be difficult to demonstrate , the use of the chemotactic behavior displayed by C-Fern sperm can be an effective approach . Using a drop of liquid and a stereomicroscope , sperm can be easily and repeatedly observed to be positively attracted to L-malate , in comparison with D-malate or a control . This attraction can be related to the natural process of chemotaxis that is associated with the chemical discharge from mature archegonia , which can also be shown to elicit a strong positive response . Students can also investigate whether other components of the Krebs cycle also attract sperm and whether pH and temperature are important modifiers of that attraction . <p> Figure 7 . Structures of L- and D-malic acid . <p> Plant growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cytokinins , exhibit specific effects on development , sexual differentiation , and growth of Ceratopteris gametophytes and sporophytes ( Hickok and Kiriluk 1984 , Hickok et al . 1995 , Leslie Hickok , unpublished data ) . Contrasting and comparing the effects of these growth regulators in C-Fern and higher plants can be an effective approach in exercises dealing with plant differentiation and development . Not just another life cycle <p> The examples in this article illustrate only a few of the ways in which C-Fern can be used in the classroom as a dynamic and interactive system with which to investigate basic biological principles . Many extensions or elaborations of these examples are possible . The ability of students to rapidly gain familiarity with the organism and to easily manipulate it in culture can lead to original thinking and experimentation . Because of its ease of use , simplicity , reliability , and speed , C-Fern can be used to involve students in the processes of science , rather than in only learning the facts and terms associated with " just another life cycle .

##4000067 Section : AIBS News <p> On 9 July 1998 , AIBS repre-sentatives met with the leaders of two dozen professional societies in the life sciences to discuss their undergraduate education initiatives . The workshop , " Collaborations in Undergraduate Education , " was sponsored by the Coalition for Education in the Life Sciences ( CELS ) through a grant from the Exxon Education Foundation . AIBS was represented by education committee member John R. Jungck , Executive Director Richard O'Grady , and then-AIBS education committee chair ( see article below ) Gordon E. Uno . Participants exchanged information about undergraduate education activities supported by their societies , discussed the types of programs that are well suited to sponsorship by individual societies or clusters of societies , and identified potential coordinating roles for CELS . <p> Jungck , who is also a CELS steering committee member , introduced the participants to a new CELS monograph , Professional Societies and the Faculty Scholar : Promoting Scholarship and Learning in the Life Sciences . Jungck advocates using peer review as a mechanism by which to honor undergraduate teaching as a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the cornerstone for establishing the credibility of scientific research , seems highly appropriate as the review process for legitimating , developing , and assessing pedagogical knowledge production and practices , " he said . He applauded the leadership displayed by AIBS through its regular inclusion of peer-reviewed articles on biology education in BioScience . <p> The workshop participants emphasized the role of introductory biology courses in serving the vast majority of US college students . " A challenge for our faculty is to define what we want our students to know , to value , and to do , " Uno said . " What will help our students acquire scientific literacy ? We need to address content , attitudes , and the constellation of skills that include critical thinking , inquiry-based investigations , data analysis , and interpretations . " <p> Participants also discussed the CELS " Issues-Based Framework for Bio 101 , " which gives guideposts toward biological literacy for an educated citizenry . CELS invited the professional societies to modify this framework by identifying concepts in their own disciplines that are critical for literacy , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One suggestion was that CELS coordinate a traveling display of biological and curricular materials that can be exhibited by the professional societies at their annual meetings . The materials would be drawn from the expertise and resources of many professional societies and provide coherence to the diversity of topics in the biological sciences . <p> Workshop participants noted that through member society relationships with groups including BioQUEST , the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study , BIOSIS , the National Association of Biology Teachers , and the Association of College and University Biology Educators , AIBS has sustained a reputation for bringing science educators and scientists together to share their expertise . O'Grady remarked that professional societies have a special responsibility to value the junior , often nontenured , undergraduate instructors who teach biology courses for nonscience majors . " Our professional societies need to encourage and recognize their teaching accomplishments , " noted O'Grady , " lest we lose them and their students from biology . " <p> Professional Societies and the Faculty Scholar can be viewed at the CELS Web site , www.wisc.edu/cels . This 87-page report highlights the contributions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions to improve teaching and learning . The Web site also provides information for ordering bound copies of the monograph and contains the " Issues-Based Framework for Bio 101 .

Liao , CELS program director , at cels@macc.wisc.edu . AIBS EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR APPOINTED <p> AIBS is pleased to announce the appointment of Jean Wyld as the new chair of the AIBS Education Committee . AIBS President Gary Barrett and President-Elect Gregory Anderson appointed Wyld to the position vacated by Gordon E. Uno , who recently became Program Director ( Biology ) of the Course and Curriculum Development Section , Division of Undergraduate Education , at the National Science Foundation . Uno continues to serve as a member of the committee . <p> Wyld received her PhD in systematics and evolutionary biology from the University of Connecticut in 1980 and later spent a year as an American Council on Education fellow in the office of the Executive Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator at Colby-Sawyer College in New London , New Hampshire , and since 1993 has been Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Professor of Biology at York College in York , Pennsylvania . <p> Wyld says , " It is my hope that the Education Committee of AIBS can help K-12 teachers and college and university faculty gain greater recognition for their creative efforts in the classroom . Working with our member organizations , it may also be possible to enhance existing opportunities for the publication of this kind of scholarship in biology . " <p> Wyld may be contacted at Academic Affairs/Advising , ADM-16 , York College , York , PA 17405-7199 ; 717/815-1231 ; fax : 717/849-1607 ; e-mail : jaw@ycp.edu .

NRC report : life sciences training and employment <p> A new report from the National Research Council ( NRC ) , " Trends in the Early Careers of Life Scientists , " examines the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postgraduate life scientist training and subsequent employment . The report finds that the number of people with life science PhDs increasingly exceeds the number of jobs available . The NRC report suggests that universities limit growth in the number of graduate students and refrain from developing new programs . <p> According to the report , between 1975 and 1995 the number of PhD recipients who had permanent positions in academia , industry , and government 9-10 years after receipt of their doctorates fell from 87% to 73% . During the same 20-year period , the number of PhD recipients with permanent positions in those sectors 5-6 years after receipt of their PhDs fell from 89% to 61% . <p> The NRC report refers to the widening time gap between receiving a PhD and obtaining a permanent position as a " holding pattern , " which is contributed to by a 42% increase in PhDs awarded between 1987 and 1996 that was not accompanied by a parallel increase in employment opportunities . The increase in PhDs awarded occurred mainly in biomedical fields , although biologists in nonbiomedical fields are also experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimensions , Causes , and Implications of Recent Trends in the Careers of Life Scientists , which conducted the study and prepared the report , it is " unlikely that conditions will change enough in the near future to provide employment for the large number of life science PhDs now waiting in the holding pattern . " <p> In response to declining job security and lower salaries , many life scientists have turned to alternative careers , such as law , science writing , science policy , and secondary-school teaching . But the NRC committee is not convinced that alternative scientific careers hold as much opportunity as was once anticipated . Instead , it says , " the challenges for the life-science community are to acknowledge that it is the structure of the profession that has led to declining prospects for its young and to develop accommodations to maximize the quantity and quality of the scientific productivity of the future . " <p> The five primary recommendations made by the NRC committee are : Restrain the rate of growth of the number of graduate students in the life sciences ; Disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Improve the educational experience of graduate students ; Enhance opportunities for independence of postdoctoral fellows ; and Evaluate alternative paths to careers in the life sciences . <p> The full text of the NRC committee 's report , " Trends in the Early Careers of Life Scientists , " is available on the National Academy Press 's Web site , www.nap.edu .

##4000466 Section : SYMPOSIUM : The Effects of ; Multiculturalism on Scholarship <p> The papers here presented were originally delivered at the seventh conference of the National Association of Scholars in New Orleans , Louisiana , as part of a panel that convened on the afternoon of 12 December 1997 . <p> Over the centuries , philosophy has been seen in many ways : as a midwife to the birth of ideas , as queen of the sciences , as an owl flying at dusk , as a ladder to be kicked away upon reaching enlightenment , and as a large-scale map relating the small-scale maps of the sciences . The image suggested by philosophy 's role in recent changes in the academy is Typhoid Mary-one who infects others while avoiding serious illness herself . Many ideas that underlie the politicization of the university had their origin in philosophy . Yet philosophy has largely managed to escape politicization . I <p> Let 's begin by distinguishing two kinds of multiculturalism . Diane Ravitch has defined pluralistic multiculturalism as the quest to enrich our common culture , making it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a strong advocate of this kind of multiculturalism . Philosophy has often been conceived and taught as something created by Socrates in fifth-century B.C. Athens and developed over the centuries in Western Europe and North America . That picture is misleading and incomplete . The Buddha , Confucius , and Lao Tzu all predate Socrates. ( n2 ) Though one could argue that none are truly philosophers-none concerns himself primarily with establishing conclusions by careful definition and argumentation-rich philosophical traditions have grown from their work and , indeed , were growing from their work by the time of Aristotle. ( n3 ) Study of these traditions not only expands one 's sense of the questions that can be asked and the answers that can be given but also dispels the quasi-Hegelian sense of inevitability that often accompanies the study of the history of philosophy . <p> In its effects on philosophy as a discipline , however , multiculturalism has not primarily been pluralistic . It has encouraged scholarship on other cultures , but those effects are small compared to the effects of politicized multiculturalism -- or illiberal multiculturalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sees scholarship and the curriculum as a means to political change . <p> I have argued in other places that multiculturalism is a classic bait-and-switch operation. ( n4 ) The arguments are always for pluralistic multiculturalism-unless addressed to the already converted ! -- but the actual goal is the political transformation of the university . One could have guessed this from the comments of two Stanford activists , quoted by D'Souza eight years ago : <p> We 're not saying we need to study Tibetan philosophy . We 're arguing that we need to understand what made our society what it is . Forget Confucius . We are trying to prepare ourselves for the multicultural challenge we will face in the future. ( n5 ) <p> But what does pluralistic multiculturalism in philosophy offer ? Confucius , Tibetan philosophy , and the like ! Now Confucianism and Buddhism are central to the worldviews of much of Asia 's population , and Asian Americans are some of the nation 's fastest-growing ethnic groups . Interactions with Asia are of vital political and economic importance . Studying these philosophies might therefore seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face in the future , " if that is what is at issue . But they have no obvious political implications . So , interest in them is limited . II <p> The dominance of illiberal multiculturalism over its pluralistic alternative is evident in patterns of philosophical research . I have examined the number of publications reported in each of the past ten years in The Philosophers ' Index on various topics -- some pluralistic , some political -- to judge the actual effects of multiculturalism on philosophical research . There has been an increase in scholarship devoted to non-Western philosophy , but it has been modest , and , in several areas , there are signs of its being short lived . <p> Consider first issues of quantity : <p> Japanese philosophy : The average number of publications from 1991-1996 was 2.3 times the 1987-1990 average . <p> Buddhism : The number of publications is up 77 percent since 1987 . <p> Chinese philosophy : The number of publications is up 55 percent from 1987 , but is down 32 percent from its 1991 high . <p> Indian philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , but is down 35 percent from its 1991 high . <p> African philosophy : The number of publications is below 1987 , but the high was fairly recent , in 1994 . <p> So much for the philosophical stock quotations. ( n6 ) <p> Issues of quality are harder to judge . Some of the scholarship on nonWestern philosophy has itself been politicized . David Hall and Roger Ames , for example , find Confucian thought remarkably similar to that of " such thinkers as Foucault , Derrida , and the American pragmatist Richard Rorty. " ( n7 ) They take Confucius 's talk of the mandate of Heaven as referring to " the specific environing conditions that set up the viable possibilities in a particular social setting or historical epoch " ( 12 ) . This is the opposite of standard readings , according to which the Will of Heaven is transcendent : the decree of God , the moral order , or , in Chu Hsi 's words , " the operation of Nature which is endowed in things and makes things be as they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construal is something like Arthur Schlesinger , Jr . ' s , citation of the words of the Declaration of Independence , " We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , " as establishing the Founders ' relativism . To paraphrase Allan Bloom , people advancing arguments like these must think their audience will believe anything. ( n9 ) But there is more than silliness behind them . Hall and Ames maintain that the mandate of Heaven is purely contingent and context-relative to discredit the notion of rights and to justify the suppression of the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. ( n10 ) <p> Still , scholarship on non-Western philosophy generally remains solid . Increased attention to non-Western traditions is a good thing , a positive effect of multiculturalism . The number of publications remains small , and key texts often have not even been translated into English or any other modern European language , let alone interpreted . There is historical and philosophical work of real significance to be done . III <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political effects of multiculturalism . Overall , in 1996 there were 34 percent more publications on non-Western philosophy than there were in 1987 . Compare the following more political topics : <p> Racism : Up 587 percent from the 1987-1990 average . <p> Diversity : Up 1000 percent from 1987 ( even from 1993 ) . <p> Feminism : Up 341 percent from 1987 . <p> Gender : Up 392 percent from 1987 . <p> Moreover , feminism has ten times the number of publications for racism , and more than all areas of non-Western philosophy combined. ( n11 ) <p> Ten years ago , feminism had about as many publications as Indian and African philosophy combined . In 1996 , it had about four times as many as those two combined . Here is another way of looking at it : In 1996 , there were forty-five more publications in non-Western philosophy than in 1987 . There were 148 more publications in feminism . Add in racism , diversity , and gender , and there were 234 more . Politicized , illiberal multiculturalism has had far greater effects than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go far wrong in saying that multiculturalism in philosophy has mostly meant feminism . <p> This is odd . Women do not have a distinctive culture . Moreover , since women do not form a " discrete and insular minority " -- or , in this case , majority -- the effects of past discrimination are not inherited by the next generation of women . It seems a stretch , therefore , to include feminism under the heading of multiculturalism at all . Nevertheless , women outnumber minorities , Sanskrit specialists , Sinologists , and others . IV <p> What is wrong with feminist philosophy ? I can give only the sketchiest answer here , and I hasten to say that feminist philosophy is not all politicized . The earliest philosophers to work in feminism , especially , have done some significant research . But , as I have argued elsewhere , multiculturalism is best seen as a form of mercantilism. ( n12 ) As always , in protected industries , quality declines from a lack of competition . That has happened in feminist philosophy . <p> A great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goal is political change , not truth . Now this is not always fatal ; one may have political motivations to seek the truth . It is always dangerous , however , for the same political motivations can lead one to ignore or suppress the truth . What makes it especially dangerous in this case is that feminist research is characterized by a lack of empirical evidence and argument . There is , in fact , a marked hostility to science. ( n13 ) Entire books have been written on child development , family relations , and so on , by people who not only have never done any empirical research on these topics themselves but who also have no familiarity with the relevant empirical research done by others . <p> Much feminist philosophy exhibits what Thomas Sowell calls " the vision of the anointed. " ( n14 ) Researchers display a bipolar view , with dichotomies between oppressor and oppressed , " targets " and " mascots . " There is no sense of tradeoffs and complexities . Social problems are attributed to the heteropatriarchy without any felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heralded as " radical reconceptions " of traditional notions . <p> Most puzzling of all to analytic philosophers are wild forms of argument found in feminist and other politicized research . Many of these are not original with illiberal multiculturalists , but have their roots in Marx , Freud , Heidegger , or various postmodernists . <p> Argument from authority : A says that p <p> Therefore : p <p> ( This works only if A is a canonical figure such as Marx , Foucault , Derrida , and Rorty . It is strengthened if the premise has the form " A has argued that p " or even " A has shown that p , " as in " Rorty has shown that truth is relative to an interpretive community . " If A is a target figure such as Locke or Adam Smith , of course , such language is inappropriate , and one may instead conclude Not p . ) <p> Raising the question : A has called p into question . <p> Therefore : Not p <p> ( " Derrida has called into question the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning is impossible . " ) <p> Argument from interests : Asserting that p could serve the interests of someone I dislike ( a " target " ) . <p> Therefore : Not p <p> ( " Saying that women earn less than men because women interrupt careers to have children , work fewer hours , obtain fewer degrees in technical areas than men , and the like of course serves the interests of successful men in the workforce who do not want their own privileges to be challenged . So , those are not the real reasons for women 's reduced earnings . " ) <p> When the revolution comes : p would not change some feature of the status quo , but q would . <p> Therefore : q and Not p <p> ( " Lacan 's understanding of the development of the child 's self-concept in the mirror stage tends to leave contemporary social/sexual roles unchallenged , while Kristeva 's radical reconception of the mirror stage provides the ground for contending that contemporary roles are oppressive . So , Kristeva 's revolutionary account of the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary account . " ) <p> Reductio ad anything : X is analogous in some respect to Y. <p> Therefore : X is really Y <p> ( The locus classicus of this is Marx , for whom anything analogous to class struggle is really an instance of class struggle . It appears in Freud , where the reduction is to sexual drives , and in Foucault : " Schools and hospitals are analogous in some ways to prisons . Prisons are means of social control . So , schools and hospitals are means of social control . " Compare the argument in a recent history article : " The dominance of whites over blacks in the slave South has many parallels to the dominance of men over women . So , the phenomenon of slavery is best understood as an instance of sexual oppression , in which Africans were forced into the role of woman . " ) <p> Causes in the air : X is conceptually related to Y. <p> Therefore : X causes y. ( n15 ) <p> ( In Freud , " The rat man 's fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . So , his fear of rats is caused by his fear of his father . " Or , in Kristeva , " The hostility , fear , and sense of alterity that men have for women is structurally similar in some ways to the sense of alterity the weaned child develops for the mother 's breast . So , weaning is the cause of sexual discrimination . " ) <p> In isolation , these arguments are obviously silly . In context , however , and embedded deeply in layers of nearly unintelligible prose , they are hard to identify and evaluate . It is no accident that much politicized philosophy is written in an intentionally opaque style . That , however , is not the full story . When intelligent scholars make such intellectual moves , one must apply a principle of charity and consider the possibility that they are not advancing arguments at all . Many feminists think of themselves as applying the hermeneutic method , that is , as creating interpretations rather than constructing arguments . If those interpretations do not aim at truth and employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear why the rest of us should pay attention . V <p> Despite the increase in politicized scholarship , the effects of multiculturalism on philosophy have been limited . Philosophy has not gone the way of English ; we have not returned to the cave . There are a number of positive signs . Even at four times its 1987 level , Feminism still has fewer entries in the Philosophers ' Index than God-and less than one-third the number for Logic . Class-related topics are declining . Marxism is the topic of 56 percent fewer publications than in 1987 . Postmodernism is down almost 50 percent from its 1993 high , as is deconstruction . These are the topics of 209 fewer publications than in 1993. ( n16 ) The field 's top journals-The Journal of Philosophy , Philosophical Review , Ethics , Philosophy and Public Affairs , Mind , Nous , and Philosophy and Phenomenological Research , as judged by circulation , acceptance rate , and prestige-publish little or no politicized work . A much smaller percentage of work in politicized fields is in refereed journals ; much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inroads at top graduate departments . Of the top thirty Ph.D . programs in philosophy , 75 percent have no one on the faculty who lists feminism as an area of specialization . The few politicized Ph.D . programs rank low in national surveys . Politicized job candidates fare relatively poorly . According to American Philosophical Association statistics , ( n17 ) in 1995-96 there were : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The only area worse than the politicized areas of feminism and Continental philosophy is philosophy of religion . ( People still write about God , but can not get jobs doing it . ) That logic is near the top , and politicized areas near the bottom , is very good news for the discipline . VI <p> Despite philosophy 's success at containing illiberal scholarship , there are worrisome signs . Politicized works that can not find places in top or even middling refereed journals nevertheless find outlets . Feminists and others have created their own journals . They have come to dominate certain publishers who increasingly offer book contracts before seeing a manuscript . They even actively solicit authors-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has little market in philosophy itself but a much larger market in English , women 's studies , and related areas . The areas that philosophy has infected are thus reinfecting philosophy . In politicized areas , there is an ethic of lavish praise for other politicized researchers in book reviews , referee reports for publishers , tenure and promotion reviews , and so on . <p> The result , as Barry Smith has pointed out , is that people working in politicized areas can increasingly create sham curricula vitae filled with sham publications-items that would never have been published in more mainstream , respectable channels or , in some cases , that have not yet been written . Promotion files are padded not only with sham CVs but also sham review letters . It is thus possible for people to take paths quite apart from traditional academic evaluation to create the appearance of academic achievement . <p> There are few effective checks on this process . Those who try to point out the sham face the response , " People in that area give the work high marks . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " This tends to win out in tenure and promotion committees , many of whose members hail from politicized areas of the humanities or social sciences . <p> The fact is that it is much easier to create an impressive-looking CV in politicized areas than in traditional areas of scholarship . This creates perverse incentives for younger scholars , especially women , many of whom gravitate to politicized fields , much to their professional detriment . The path looks easy but , as the job data mentioned above illustrate , the appearance is deceptive . Philosophers who see through the sham realize that effective evaluation of researchers in politicized areas has become impossible ; the safest response is not to hire them in the first place . But graduate students often lack information about the job market until it is too late . VII <p> Why has philosophy withstood the assault of illiberal multiculturalism as successfully as it has ? I can not go into a full explanation here . Part of the story is that contemporary analytic philosophy takes science as a model . Hans Reichenbach , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that analytic philosophy has not only frequently taken science as a subject matter , viewing scientific investigation as an epistemic ideal and largely replacing traditional epistemology with the philosophy of science , but also itself stresses precision , mathematical formalism , and argumentation . Philosophy has withstood political attack for many of the same reasons that science has done so . <p> A deeper reason is that , as Allan Bloom noted , multiculturalism challenges the possibility of philosophy . The illiberal multiculturalists are neo-Sophists . Western philosophy was born in Socrates 's struggle against such Sophists as Protagoras . Anything that suggests that there is no truth , or that truth is in the eye of the beholder -- in Protagoras 's words , that knowledge is perception , that man is the measure of all things -- is antithetical to philosophy itself . Without truth , as Protagoras , Socrates , Plato , and Nietzsche alike saw , there is only power-something philosophers notoriously lack . <p> Please address correspondence to Academic Questions/NAS , 575 Ewing Street , Princeton , NJ 08540-2741 ; **25;561;TOOLONG . <p> 
##4000467 Section : SYMPOSIUM : The Effects of ; Multiculturalism on Scholarship <p> The papers here presented were originally delivered at the seventh conference of the National Association of Scholars in New Orleans , Louisiana , as part of a panel that convened on the afternoon of 12 December 1997 . <p> In the past fifteen or twenty years , a massive shift has occurred in the attention of literary scholars . Scholarly effort has increasingly moved away from traditional areas of study to the literature of Latin America , the Caribbean , Sub-Saharan Africa , and the Indian subcontinent , with some attention to the literature of the Islamic world and Asia in general . This body of work is often grouped together , somewhat misleadingly , under such rubrics as " Third World " or " postcolonial " literature . In surveying this development , it is hard not to form the impression that many critics are turning to non-Western literature just to get away from Western . This brand of scholarship often seems linked to politically correct developments in the curriculum , such as the imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will refer to as postcolonial scholarship often seems rooted in an animus against Western culture and specifically its literary classics . Postcolonial critics seem to operate with the assumption that if a work is non-Western , it must be good , and the less Western the better . These critics seem particularly attracted to works that articulate anti-Western views , that question the values of Western civilization and champion non-Western alternatives . This attitude explains the specifically postcolonial element in this critical project , the focus on literature from areas formerly colonized by European nations . This literature often takes the form of attacks on European imperialism , turning the tables on the old colonial masters in a motif that has come to be known , somewhat facetiously , as " the Empire Strikes Back . " ( n1 ) Critics are especially interested in works that rewrite classics of colonial literature , which seemed to embody a sense of European superiority . A good example of this kind of work would be Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children , which among other things rewrites Rudyard Kipling 's Kim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics from the West . Much of postcolonial criticism is explicitly or at least implicitly Marxist , centering on the concept of exploitation . Third World literature is viewed as primarily expressing the reaction of postcolonial peoples to having been exploited by their former European masters . This approach turns the field into a branch of Oppression Studies , the dominant mode of radical academics today . Third World authors are often championed as the ultimate voices of the oppressed , exploited in terms of race , class , and gender , with the added twist of having been subjugated by colonial masters . At the same time , the Third World often supplies critics of Western civilization with an imaginary site for the kind of anti-Western utopia they dream of . Everything the First World does wrong , the Third World supposedly does right . It is socialist rather than capitalist , communitarian in spirit rather than individualistic . Particularly in the case of ecologically sensitive areas like rainforests , the Third World purportedly respects the environment , rather than trying to dominate it as the West does . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced new forms of barbarism in the West , will be cancelled out in the non-Western world , and humanity can return to , or at least finally achieve , the harmony with nature that Western rationality , in its Faustian quest for power , fatefully disrupted . In short , many postcolonial critics use the Third World and Third World literature as a more or less blank screen on which to project their hatred of the West and their desire to see its civilization subverted and somehow repudiated . In this sense , much postcolonial criticism is in fact monocultural rather than multicultural . It advances a simple and single-minded anti-Western view that it tends to impose uniformly on all Third World literature . <p> Despite all these problems with postcolonial criticism , I want to argue that it does not have to be automatically and unthinkingly anti-Western . And just because the majority of practitioners in the field are currently misguided does not mean that the field itself is illegitimate . It seems to me that literary scholars who oppose the radicalization of their discipline are making a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the academic left . Properly rethought and reformulated , the study of literature from the Third World could serve as a powerful counterweight to some of the most harmful trends in contemporary criticism . And the fact that all non-Western works are not automatically good does not mean that none of them are good . In fact , much of the best literature in this century has come from outside Europe and the United States . The so-called boom in Latin American fiction is probably the best-known example of this phenomenon . One need only cite the names of Jorge Luis Borges , Gabriel Garcia Marquez , Mario Vargas Llosa , Julio Cortazar , Alejo Carpentier , Guillermo Cabrera Infante , Carlos Fuentes , Jose Donoso , and so on , to give some idea of how much Latin America has contributed to world literature in roughly the past half century . But similar contributions could be cited from writers in Africa , Asia , and Australia . Traditional literary scholars should be alert to good and great writing no matter where it comes from . We must not act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope . If new stars are shining in the literary firmament , we should be among the first to spot them , not the last . <p> And there are reasons why we should in fact expect to find superior literature being written under new regimes around the world . In many ways , the literary tradition in Europe and the United States shows signs of being played out , of having reached a kind of postmodern impasse . Authors in Europe and the United States often display a strong sense of being latecomers on the literary scene , of coming at the very end of a long literary tradition that stretches all the way back to Homer in ancient Greece . Acutely self-conscious about their authorial roles , Europeans and Americans often get wrapped up in convoluted literary strategies , focusing on their own concerns and problems as writers . " Another novel about a novelist struggling to write a novel about a novelist struggling to write a novel " -- that has become the sad refrain of the contemporary literary scene in Europe and the United States . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-absorption of contemporary European and American authors . Third World writers often view themselves as coming at the beginning of a literary tradition , rather than at the end . This is true even in a country like India , which has a literary tradition that stretches back farther than that of any European country . It is precisely the postcolonial situation that gives Third World authors a sense of freshness about what they are doing ; national liberation becomes a form of artistic liberation as well . Here the classic text is again Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children , which correlates its own genesis as a narrative with that of modern India on 15 August 1947 , when the country achieved its long-sought independence from Britain . <p> Another reason writers like Rushdie or Vargas Llosa seem more energized than their European or American counterparts is that they are taken seriously by the communities for which they write . European and American authors often seem to have retreated into the academy ; even if they do not earn their living from university positions , they write with academic critics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Third World writers generally have a greater sense of their social responsibility , often seeking out a role in building a new cultural identity for their people in a postcolonial situation . Being taken more seriously by a community sometimes carries a fearful price tag , as Rushdie has learned , but it also gives greater vitality to writers ' work , as they deal with issues of more than merely personal and artistic significance . <p> This situation leads to a paradox in the contemporary critical scene . Often the same people who complain about the empty gestures and easy nihilism of postmodern literature in the West also complain about postcolonial literature , even though it offers an alternative to postmodernism . To be sure , many critics have argued for a connection between postmodernism and postcolonialism , and many postcolonial authors , like Rushdie , clearly have learned and adopted much from the techniques of postmodern fiction . But postmodernism and postcolonial literature are in many respects at odds , if only because the situation of postcolonial authors demands that they seek out subject matter other than themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sterile postmodern self-reflexivity. ( n2 ) As the Rushdie affair showed with unusual clarity , postcolonial authors are confronting issues that truly matter to people around the world , issues that engage their deepest passions . Who ever cared enough about anything Thomas Pynchon wrote to want to threaten his life ? <p> Thus the study of postcolonial literature may offer a way out of the impasse of postmodern criticism . Though many of the most prominent postcolonial critics would identify themselves as postmodernists and poststructuralists , the way they treat non-Western as opposed to Western authors suggests otherwise . When critics today deal with Western literature , they tend to proclaim the death of the author ; they aggressively disregard what an author might have intended in his work , and instead substitute various forms of reading against the text to bring out meanings the author never intended . But these critics read texts from the Third World in the opposite way , as shown by the return of the concept of " voice , " so much despised by Jacques Derrida and his deconstructionist followers . Third World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression of their people and to " voice " their opposition to a hegemonic Western culture . Somehow in contemporary criticism non-Western authors are allowed what is denied to their Western counterparts , namely their own voices . Postcolonial critics treat Third World authors as having intentions and carrying them out successfully in their works . That is what it means to talk about the empire striking back or writing back ; it implies the return of the author , often with a vengeance . When Rushdie is said to rewrite a Kipling work , he is being credited with having a conscious literary strategy . We should be exploiting this contradiction in contemporary criticism , the fact that traditional works are approached with untraditional methods , which deny the principle of authorial intention , whereas untraditional works are often approached with traditional methods , which indeed focus on the Third World author as occupying a definite " subject position " and expressing his distinct subjectivity . <p> Moreover , an open-minded confrontation with postcolonial literature will reveal that the image of it fostered by postcolonial critics is distorted and misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not programmatically anti-Western in their books ( their public pronouncements on specific political issues may be a different matter ) . Some of them , like Rushdie , demonstrate a complex understanding of how Western culture has contributed to non-Western . Rushdie is particularly fascinated by the way encounters between East and West have created hybrid cultural phenomena , richer and more complex than any one nation could have produced on its own. ( n3 ) By the same token , some postcolonial authors have proven to be among the most incisive critics of postcolonial regimes . The Nigerian author , Chinua Achebe , for example , has produced a series of novels , from No Longer at Ease to Anthills of the Savannah , that indict the corruption and cynicism of dictatorial governments in Africa with unparalleled insight and authority . Reading the novels of Rushdie and Achebe , one does not encounter what many postcolonial critics would lead one to expect : neither kneejerk condemnation of Western culture nor uncritical celebration of non-Western culture . Rather these authors offer a thoughtful examination of the problematic interaction of Western and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negative aspects of both sides . <p> In that sense , writers like Rushdie and Achebe offer examples of true multiculturalism . It is a sad commentary on much of postcolonial criticism that Rushdie and Achebe , and even more so Vargas Llosa and V.S. Naipaul , have fallen out of favor and are now more likely to be condemned than praised by scholars in the field . Because these authors do not tell the story of the Third World many postcolonial critics wish to promote -- because they do not support the myth of a non-Western world unequivocally superior to the Westsome scholars dismiss them as inauthentic , not true representatives of the Third World but rather paid lackeys of the West. ( n4 ) That is why it is imperative not to abandon the field of postcolonial studies to academic radicals , and thus allow them to construct and perpetuate a false image of literature around the world in accord with their anti-Western agenda . Postcolonial criticism has paradoxically blinded itself precisely to the multiculturalism of authors like Rushdie , Achebe , Vargas Llosa , and Naipaul ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way between conflicting cultures . Fortunately there are signs that the field is finally opening up to an appreciation of the genuine multicultural possibilities inherent in the postcolonial situation . I would cite the brilliant book by Michael Valdez Moses of Duke University , The Novel and the Globalization of Culture ( New York : Oxford University Press , 1995 ) , which does the best job I know of charting the interplay between Western and non-Western elements in the writings of authors such as Conrad , Achebe , and Vargas Llosa . <p> Thus I find myself in the odd situation of someone who generally supports the traditional canon but who also advocates multiculturalism in literary scholarship , but only if it is real multiculturalism and not the sham that prevails in most postcolonial criticism today . I am in favor of studying literature from all over the world , provided it measures up to genuine aesthetic standards and is not praised simply because it is non-Western in origin . In fact , viewed dispassionately , the best literature from Latin America , Africa , and Asia will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes we must recognize that non-Western authors are dealing with different circumstances or facing different artistic problems , and we must adjust our criteria accordingly . For example , Rushdie 's novels do not have the linearity of many European narratives , but that is not the result of his inability to tell a straightforward story from start to finish . Rather , the cyclic patterns in his fiction reflect the cyclic structures of Hindu myth , which he must in fact employ if his novels are to mirror the distinctive consciousness of his Indian characters , who are influenced by their Hindu heritage . Moreover , Midnight 's Children in effect stages a debate between Western ideas of linear progress in history and Eastern ideas of historical cycles ; the tension between linear and cyclic patterns in the narrative is thus entirely appropriate . If one fixates on the principle of linear narrative as the only criterion of merit in fiction , Rushdie 's novels will be found wanting . But if one appeals to a more basic aesthetic principle , recognized since Aristotle , namely the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative in Rushdie will be found to be an aesthetic success . Many of what may at first appear to be odd aesthetic principles within the work of non-Western authors turn out to have parallels in the work of canonical Western authors . Joyce and Beckett , for example , adopted cyclical forms in their fiction as well , and often for the same reasons that Rushdie does . <p> Only if we allow for the possibility of such cross-cultural comparisons , of applying the same broad standards to products of different cultures , can we keep the study of postcolonial literature genuinely multicultural . Many postcolonial critics want Third World authors to serve as simple spokesmen for their nations , to give expression to some kind of authentic native culture , preferably uncontaminated by contact with the West . The last thing such critics want is any suggestion that Western culture has contributed to non-Western . And yet the very existence of postcolonial literature is evidence of the fruitful interchange between Western and non-Western cultures all around the globe . After all , many of the best postcolonial authors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spanish . This has often been a controversial decision ; some authors , like the Kenyan novelist and playwright Ngugi , have argued passionately in favor of postcolonial authors writing in their native tongues . But his arguments have been ably countered by authors like Achebe and Rushdie. ( n5 ) They defend their writing in English because it gives them access to a wider audience , even within their own countries . Moreover , Achebe and Rushdie argue that they are not surrendering to their old colonial masters by writing in English because they do not write the King 's English . Rather , they create a hybrid tongue , mixing native vocabulary and speech rhythms with English . In their hands , English thus becomes something genuinely multicultural . But let us recall that English has always been a richly multicultural language . Ever since the days of the Norman Conquest , it has mixed an " imported " French with a " native " Anglo-Saxon and has always been willing to adopt elements from other languages , including Latin and Greek . In the nineteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights in pointing out how many of our seemingly ordinary English words have Indian origins : bungalow , thug , mogul , pundit , loot , verandah , dungarees , cummerbund . The list goes on and on. ( n6 ) The history of the English language is a good reminder that culture fundamentally is multicultural ; one culture is always assimilating elements from another . But that means that trying to deny the Western contribution to non-Western culture is a futile and self-defeating gesture . <p> In sum , even as a staunch supporter of the traditional literary canon , I welcome the study of Third World literature and the development of postcolonial criticism . All I ask is that this field become genuinely multicultural in its approach . That would involve recognizing the true complexity of how cultures operate and develop , and above all refusing to straitjacket postcolonial authors as the simple spokesmen for , and hence the captives of , hypothetical pure native cultures . That in turn means allowing for the possibility that Third World authors may be critical of the native cultures they supposedly represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western culture , which in many cases is at least one of the sources of their own brilliant achievement as writers . <p> 
##4001062 Section : Creative Controversy <p> In keeping with the policy of the Humanist to accommodate the diverse social , political , and philosophical viewpoints of its readers , this occasional feature allows for the expression of alternative and dissenting views on issues previously broached within these pages . <p> FEW VALUES , if any , have more widespread acceptance today in the United States than tolerance . Religious tolerance is especially lauded and has had its staunch supporters in this country since early in the colonial period . Today , although some advocate it more strongly and more often than others , people of nearly all beliefs and political persuasions can be heard arguing in favor of tolerance . The principle seems inherent in a pluralistic , democratic society . <p> In its most basic sense , tolerance means respect for the practices and beliefs of others -- whether or not we agree with them . What thinking person could disagree with such an idea ? No community or culture could exist , and neither could coexist , without some tolerance . A major reason the idea has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for others . <p> Those today who most frequently and strongly advocate tolerance usually do so based on the idea that truth is relative ; no one person , group , or culture -- the argument goes -- has a monopoly on truth , so one can believe what one wants but can not impose that belief on someone else . By maintaining your own truth without seeking to force it on others , you are showing the respect characteristic of a tolerant person . <p> This relativism is applied in many areas . We say that what is right for the Christian is n't necessarily right for the Muslim , Buddhist , agnostic , and so on . Similarly , the tolerant view on abortion says it 's fine to believe abortion is wrong but it 's intolerant to tell other women it 's wrong for them . Or if you are against interracial marriage then do n't marry someone from a different race , but do n't try to stop someone else from doing so . The tolerant view says that if you find homosexuality unappealing then do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being homosexual . <p> At first glance these arguments are appealing ; so apparently respectful of others , they appear obviously valid . They seem democratic in the sense that they endow equality of opinion and preference . They seem self-effacing in that they claim your belief is as legitimate as mine . They seem impartial . So on the surface toleration appears to be a fair-minded , democratic , modest approach that looks at the world based on the ideal of respect for others . No wonder its virtues are so frequently acclaimed . <p> But might there be a few problems in this outlook ? For one , at some level it seems to tell people how they can and can not act -- for example , by saying one can disagree with abortion but can not stop others from having one . This circumscription of behavior can be especially problematic in the case of evangelical Christianity , an area in which tolerance is perhaps most often discussed . <p> Evangelicalism is the belief that salvation is the most important moment in life and that leading others to salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , fine , believe in Jesus but do n't try to impose your belief on me . But if you take the proselytizing out of evangelicalism -- which is what advocates of tolerance desire -- what exactly are you tolerating ? Not much . Instead you are telling people they must act in accordance with your relativistic outlook . <p> A typical expression of this view occurred a couple years ago in a Washington Post story on the decision of the Southern Baptist Convention " to intensify its efforts to convert Jews to Christianity . " Rabbi Eric Yoffie , president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and frequently quoted in the Post , decried this " direct attack , " saying , " We 've been moving toward a position where all major faiths recognize the fundamental integrity of each others ' beliefs . " Well , as stated in the article , Southern Baptists believe that " all people need a personal vital relationship with Jesus Christ . " Where is Yoffie 's respect for , his tolerance of , the belief of those fifteen million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not act -- in essence saying that he 'll be glad to tolerate evangelicals as long as they do n't evangelize . <p> Conservative Christians have often pointed out this double standard , arguing that fair-mindedness should be applied to their beliefs as well as everyone else 's . I believe they have succeeded . The media today seem much more objective toward , more tolerant of , evangelicals than ten years ago . In fact , traditional Christians have succeeded so well that they often condemn even simple criticism as an act of intolerance . They have been effective in part because they have seized on tolerance 's internal contradiction of telling people how to act in the name of being hands-off . <p> In addition to telling people how to act , the ethos of tolerance also tells people what they should and should n't think . First , you should think your truth is relevant to you but not necessarily to someone else . Second , you should realize that no single group of standards is valid for everyone . Third , you should believe it is inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> Not only do these three ideas violate the avowed standards of tolerance by telling people how to think , they are also self-contradictory . Supposedly principles of relativism , they are all absolute , all pertinent everywhere at all times . In other words , they all exemplify the very thing they refute . The first is a truth applicable to everyone ; the second is one standard that encompasses all other standards ; the third says you 're wrong to tell me I 'm wrong . <p> However wonderful it sounds then , in practice , tolerance as it is espoused most commonly today seems to me a specific , absolute world view -- one that seeks to impose its way on everyone . In this world view there are clear ideas of right and wrong ; but calling them right and wrong contradicts the relativistic , self-effacing , impartial notions that supposedly govern thought and action . As a result , the issue is side-stepped : rather than saying I 'm right and you 're wrong , I have to say I 'm tolerant and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in another Washington Post article by Donna Britt . A regular columnist for the newspaper , Britt wrote a thoughtful and sometimes poignant article about the effects of television on young people . In discussing the difference between Teletubbies and South Park , Britt asks , " Why do we show America 's tiniest children worlds glistening with love and tolerance , and so often older kids the opposite ? " <p> The rest of the article is largely about why we should n't tolerate South Park . " Some things , " Britt argues , " should n't be said out loud in public . " Is n't this exactly what Jerry Falwell says about Teletubbies ? Falwell does n't want to tolerate indications , however subtle , of homosexuality ; Britt does n't want to tolerate publicly aired adult jokes . <p> The rejoinder Falwell constantly hears -- if you do n't like it , change the channel -- is conspicuously absent from Britt 's article . Many defenders of tolerance , I believe , would say this is because Falwell takes exception to something harmless ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , has characters who express intolerance of ethnic and religious differences . But this is exactly the point : the argument is over right and wrong , over different definitions of what is positive and what is harmful . <p> The fact remains that both Falwell and Britt are objecting to what they find offensive . Falwell at least admits he 's arguing about right and wrong . Too often , supporters of tolerance dodge this fact . In essence , however , they are saying that some things are okay and some are n't and they 'll tell you which are which -- Teletubbies okay ; South Park not -- and if you disagree , it 's not that they 're right and you 're wrong but that you 're intolerant . <p> Aggression in the guise of tolerance has been a common feature in the United States since its inception . Maryland is often lauded for being the first colony to pass legislation allowing freedom of religion . But the 1649 Act of Toleration was an assertive measure , a preemptive strike enacted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This minority was n't saying , " We will tolerate you , " but , instead , " You have to tolerate US . " <p> A similar thing happened in Massachusetts in the late seventeenth century . As the colony became more diverse -- as Quakers and Baptists grew in numbers , as a group of merchants arose with inclusive standards of church membership and with ties to English Anglicans -- many began to desire an end to Congregational Puritanism 's dominance in politics and religion . British rule passed an act of religious toleration and made Massachusetts drop the requirement of church membership for voting and holding office . <p> It is just as valid to call this an act of intolerance . It was an assertive measure aimed at old-style Puritans , telling them how they could and could n't act . In essence , the Crown was saying it would no longer tolerate Puritans ' persecution of Baptists and Quakers and exclusion of liberal Congregationalists and Anglicans . Was it a good thing -- was it right -- that Puritans were made to stop boring holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . But was it tolerant ? Not any more than it was intolerant . <p> Which brings up a more fundamental point : intolerance is just as important and just as necessary as tolerance . You 'll not hear anyone extol the virtues of intolerance , unless , say , politicians speak of drug offenses . But advocating tolerance without qualification is ludicrous . <p> Do I tolerate my child 's world view by letting her eat all the candy she wants ? Do I tolerate female genital mutilation , a long-standing tradition in many cultures ? If it 's 1960 , do I tolerate the cultural tradition of systematically denying civil rights to African Americans ? Should we tolerate a woman getting paid seventy cents for doing the same work for which a man gets a dollar ? These questions are presented in the extreme , but this is because tolerance is touted so broadly and praised so absolutely . There are all kinds of things we do not and should not tolerate -- and for good reason . <p> The issue , then , is not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tolerate . The question -- like it or not -- is what is right and what is wrong . And when we admit this , we have to admit we 're on the same playing field as fundamentalists , chauvinists , and racists . Racism , for example , is wrong , but not any more intolerant than anti-racism ; the racist wo n't tolerate black equality , and I wo n't tolerate racism . <p> Tolerance , then , as praised and practiced by those who preach it most , is often a mask for aggression -- an attempt to impose a fairly specific world view on society . It may be a good world view , but it is n't more tolerant than any other . <p> This is why one so often hears it said that people who advocate tolerance are the most intolerant . I do n't believe this to be the case , but I do believe the criticism has validity in that it points to a rather glaring hypocrisy : the hands-off , permissive connotation in the word is the very mechanism that triggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , much of what passes for tolerance epitomizes the exact thing it condemns . <p> By no means am I suggesting that tolerance is unimportant and should be discarded . Although most of this article has been criticism of an element of discourse I find too prevalent -- especially in the media and academia -- it was my own search to understand real quality tolerance that led to the criticism in the first place . In our diverse society , tolerance is a positive value that allows us to minimize our differences and to gain strength from them . <p> But we must have the integrity to acknowledge that tolerance itself , or the lack thereof , is not the crux of the matter . The real question is what to tolerate . In fact , simply admitting that this is the question is an act of tolerance ; rather than trying to snatch the moral high ground by talking tolerance/intolerance , it allows that even fundamental disagreement may -- not necessarily , but may -- occur on the same moral plane . <p> In accepting this principle I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than wag my finger in their face for trying to impose their beliefs on me . They are , after all , acting out of what they believe is a concern for my spiritual well-being . It is remarkable how tolerant a fundamentalist -- or just about anyone else , for that matter -- can become if his or her own opinion is offered a little respect in the first place . In the end , perhaps tolerance is much more valuable and effective when judiciously applied and when practiced instead of preached . Editor 's note : <p> The Southern Poverty Law Center , in the interest of reducing racism and ethnic conflict , offers a highly regarded public school curriculum entitled " Teaching Tolerance . " Yet this same organization seeks new laws against certain intolerant groups . Is n't that showing intolerance of intolerance ? And is n't that a contradiction ? Dr. Hazell explores this sort of question -- arriving at some counter-intuitive conclusions . <p> By J. Eric Hazell <p> <p> Eric Hazell has a Ph.D . in early U.S. history from the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of English and history .

##4001063 Section : THE POPULAR CONDITION <p> I 've never been much for elaborate conspiracy theories , but sometimes I have to step back and wonder . If I were a modern-day despot in the United States who wanted to prevent the kind of discontent that might lead to revolt , what better system could I ask for than the one presently at work ? <p> In U.S. schools , the curriculum is -- with few exceptions -- a blissfully romantic inculcation of " the American way . " Textbooks rarely impugn anything " American , " and when they do it is usually a qualified admonishment of " a great man " or " necessary " conquest . Thus , even after it was verified that Thomas Jefferson did more than write great documents at his slave-run Monticello , the majority of the nation 's writers were quick to race to the icon 's rescue , exhorting us to never forget the majestic democracy he and his fraternity designed . The result is that , almost two centuries after his death , we still fail to remember or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagated while ruling over the fledgling nation . <p> Of course , the unabashed campaign to promote patriotism and satisfaction with the status quo is certainly not limited to the peccadillos of the framers of the Constitution . When U.S. students study the Spanish-American War , are they simply inundated with heady stories about Teddy Roosevelt 's heroic charge up San Juan Hill or is there time to talk about the genocide that quashed the independence movement in the Philippines ? Is there time to broach the topic of imperialism and how the propaganda mill in the United States worked to promote a singular truth in citizens ' minds ? History , Howard Zinn reminds us , is not an objective science but a human construct -- an artifact that is created as a way to shape opinion and truth . " There is always a tendency , " Zinn says in his 1990 book The Politics of History , " to see history from the top , " but such an approach invariably leads to passivity , to an acceptance of the status quo as the best of all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , they enter the " real world " with a plethora of lofty stories about our venerable heroes and storied history . As the officially ascribed " good guys , " Americans are the survivors of a heroic battle with the iniquitous forces of communism . Precious little is written about the United States ' pandering to big business , the orchestrated fight against organized labor , or the concerted effort to keep minorities in their place . Such omissions lead to romantic monoliths , to myths about the Roaring Twenties or the blissful fifties . Few of us ever hear about segregation or the unequal tax burdens imposed upon the poor and middle class . " The class nature of the American economy is reflected in the tax structure , but this is hidden from those without time or training to study taxes , " argues Zinn . <p> After graduation from school -- where students have been given a generous helping of the superiority of capitalism , Christianity , and the rightness of American political wars -- one moves on to a virtual deluge of mind-numbing routines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be specially designed to preclude any critical analysis or political action . Consider , for example , the lives of average college students who enter the classroom with aspirations of learning to reflect upon and dissect their world . <p> I recently did a series of informal surveys with my sophomore writing class , asking them to evaluate a societal injustice they would like to expose and possibly remedy . I suggested topics like racism , classism , gender bias , or the moronic content of day-time television -- anything was an option . Incredibly , a majority came to me with few ideas about what to write . When I devoted a class session to the reality of an unequal tax system , students defended the idea of a flat tax , knowing that they -- as struggling students -- would clearly be the victims of this regressive plan . Later , when I broached the idea of racism among the students , even the African Americans waxed rhapsodic about the empowerment they felt . This , it should be noted , while affirmative action was being dismantled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The United States , for most of my students , is a curious utopia -- and this , I believe , is a result of a system that promotes passivity , intellectual indolence , and self-loathing , a system that massages its populace with mindless talk shows and courtroom melodramas where rather pathetic people are displayed for derision and pseudointellectual analysis . It really matters little whether one views the exploits of Ricki Lake , Jenny Jones , or Jerry Springer . In each case , one is confronted with a deluge of tawdry melodramas , devoid of meaning and intended only to titillate and lampoon . The upshot for those who crowd the television for these travesties is an acceptance of their place as silly and rather ridiculous people . <p> Yesterday it was the entertaining fight between unfaithful lovers . Today it is the struggle over interracial relationships . Tomorrow it will involve sordid details about women fighting over other women 's husbands . Together they fulfill a need to wallow in a collective misery while reinforcing the insignificance of the people whom they exploit . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine that begins in elementary school and runs unabated throughout one 's life . It is an education not unlike the racist minstrel shows , where African Americans were made the butt of jokes and the knowledge of their marginal status was reinforced . The only difference is that today it is in a courtroom and it is Judge Judy who is pontificating about the " sad lifestyle " of one of her victims . <p> Continued exposure to such mindless entertainment , argues Herbert Marcuse , becomes a kind of drug or candy for the oppressed populace -- replacing feelings of discontent with a deluge of mind-numbing situation comedies , sporting events , and glitzy commercials . In short , the media culture discourages the masses from thinking beyond the confines of the present by sweeping them up from reality and delivering them to a land where hegemonic ideas about wealth and beauty are seemingly just beyond their fingertips . In his 1968 book One Dimensional Man , Marcuse suggests , " The irresistible output of the entertainment and information industry carry with them prescribed attitudes and habits , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pleasantly to the producers and , through the latter , to the whole . " Propaganda in the Schools <p> All of this inculcation begins quite innocently , as kids march into kindergarten classrooms and begin to be acclimated into the " system . " Teachers stand before the class and do what teachers have clone since the first Puritan school : indoctrinate and socialize . Education is supposed to be objective and disinterested , but in fact it is quite effective at promulgating very specific ideas about discipline and " truth . " <p> The act of reading is an interesting example . For centuries , not only the content but the method of reading has been scrupulously monitored by conservative politicians who understand the significance of reading to the perpetuation of national obedience . If conservatives have their way , students will consequently learn valuable lessons about the top-clown process of U.S. education , its teacher-centeredness , and the dependence they should feel for an authority figure . <p> Today , a popular argument among conservative educators like E. D. Hirsch is for " cultural literacy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mores of the educated white elite . It is a plan that conveniently makes Shakespeare cultural literacy while rendering the practices and literature of other communities wrong or inferior . Again , the scheme is clear : if the power elite can standardize their way of life and make the subjugated aspire to reach it as a sign of success , they can rule by intellectual oppression rather than military force . Thus , when Hirsch speaks of cultural literacy , he dresses it in garb that makes it seem less like oppression than altruism . <p> In a recent essay on the question of multiculturalism and bilingual education , Hirsch chooses to call his goal to standardize the curriculum " Americanization " -- a curriculum that is " rudderless " and " romantic . " In his January/February 1999 Clearinghouse essay " Americanization and the Schools , " Hirsch suggests that " all American children need to be Americanized in a deeper sense than merely learning common American attitudes and lingo from T.V. and the streets " ; they need a " common school " where universal sentiments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Attractive sounding ? Of course . But when readers probe beyond the egalitarian rhetoric , they find a mission to standardize the public school in a way that would virtually silence the divergent voices that populate our schools and animate our nation . <p> When Hirsch speaks of common knowledge as a way to foster scholastic success , he is really asking that schools institutionalize a system that replicates and enforces his values : traditions and mores of the white elite male . For Hirsch and his friends , education is not a process that is socially constructed by real people but a law or creed that is given to passive recipients for their benefit . Like the television viewer , then , learning becomes less about discovery than listening . It centers on obedience and fealty , submission and docility -- all qualities that work well in a despotic system . <p> Thus , one is not surprised to see Tom Monaghan , the founder of Domino 's Pizza , donate $50 million of his fortune to establish a law school in Michigan that teaches " objective verities " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the powerful attempting to establish and institutionalize their version of truth . <p> Indeed , the key to controlling people is not through overt repression but through subtle persuasion . Hegemony is best practiced through official and supposedly objective channels , such as school , church , and law . When the dominant group can successfully persuade the subjugated that they deserve their inferior status -- and that it is supported by holy works , academic scholarship , and legal decisions -- they tend to become more docile and malleable . They tend to see such repression as inevitable rather than unjust . Thus , as Karl Marx and Frederich Engels argue in their 1974 book The German Ideology , " A ruling class is compelled ... to represent its interest as the common interest of all members of society ... to give its ideas the form of universality , and represent them as the only rational , universally valid ones . " <p> And so , in a society that searches for ways to cosmetically change oppression and inequality so that they seem less like injustice and more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche 's caveat that " there are no truths , only interpretations . " Equally significant is iconoclastic educator Paulo Freire 's call for all people to engage in praxis so that theories of liberation and democracy become a reality rather than simply an essay in an academic journal . <p> Perhaps all this does n't constitute a conspiracy , but it has all of the trappings of a despotic system -- one that maintains power by misinformation and control , something that is too often blamed on those other nations U.S. history books love to demonize . The question now is how can we identify and change the injustices if we are programmed to accept them ? <p> By Gregory Shafer <p> <p> Gregory Shafer is a professor of English at Mott College in Flint , Michigan . <p> 
##4001064 The Earth becomes home to six billion humans this year . In 1960 , there were three billion and in 2030 there could be eight billion to nine billion . With nearly all the increase occurring in the poor countries of <p> Africa , Asia , and Latin America ; with 585,000 women dying annually from complications of pregnancy and childbirth ; and with twenty million unsafe abortions taking place each year , governmental members and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) of the United Nations decided to take action and organized the UN International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) . <p> The initial gathering was held in Cairo , Egypt , September 5-13 , 1994 . By all accounts the conference was a remarkable achievement , hailed as a model of cooperation between UN officials , governments , NGOs , and aid agencies .

" A few specifics of the Programme include : integrating population , production , and consumption dynamics into sustainable development policies providing universal reproductive health services by 2015 developing policies and programs that support sexual education prevention of the abuses of women and girls , including prostitution and female genital mutilation the use of technology and international cooperation to foster science-based development policies the education and empowerment of women to make reproductive decisions . <p> The numerous action recommendations situated reproduction in the wider context of economic opportunity and exploitation . The Programme clearly demonstrated the philosophy that individual moral action must be understood as the result , rather than the cause , of cultural , political , and , above all , economic policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up conference was scheduled , to be held June 30-July 2 , 1999 , at UN headquarters in New York City . In preparation for Cairo Plus Five , a forum was held at the Hague March 22-April 1 of this year . It was there that the first serious signs of trouble surfaced and almost sabotaged Cairo Plus Five . Although delegates were n't supposed to renegotiate the text of the Programme of Action , a coalition of Catholic and Muslim states effectively tried to do just that . Throughout the review , the Holy See , Algeria , Argentina , Chile , Guatemala , Egypt , Libya , Morocco , Nicaragua , and Sudan raised arguments and objections about the terms choice , sex education , and especially parental consent . Most of their objections dealt with proposals on the health impact of unsafe abortion , the provision of sexual health education and services for adolescents , and safe and effective contraceptive and family-planning methods . China and some of its allies also raised objections to parts of the Programme . <p> Frustrated delegates , especially NGO observers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this small band of right-wing states that had raised the same objections at the 1994 gathering . Unless consensus could be reached on a final document to be presented in New York , Cairo Plus Five would fail and all the advances made previously would be lost . Because the consensus method of decision-making ( in contrast to voting ) was used , it became possible for a small group of delegates to prevent the overwhelming majority from proceeding with the preparation of a final text . In addition , more than 100 representatives from conservative and anti-choice organizations -- including the International Right to Life Federation ( a Rome-based coalition ) , Opus Dei , Human Life International , and the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute -- lobbied government delegates in an effort to derail the Programme of Action . <p> They almost succeeded . The Hague forum failed to produce a final document by its March 30 deadline . The deadline was extended to April 1 , but it did n't help . Things became so strained that a demonstration -- a violation of traditional " gentlemanly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If nothing improved , Cairo Plus Five would fail . <p> Immediately upon my arrival in New York on June 30 at Cairo Plus Five ( I was serving as an alternate delegate for the American Humanist Association ) , I sensed something was terribly wrong . I had been attending UN conferences as an NCO delegate for various organizations since 1978 and could tell something was up . I soon learned that a final Programme of Action was still being negotiated and that a group of Catholic and Muslim delegations was working to impede the progress of the conference . <p> Many of the 400 registered NCO delegates ( representing 300 organizations ) were furious , and an air of desperation could be felt . " We might lose everything , " one delegate said . " Why ca n't they focus on all the good that came out of Cairo ? " I met an old friend in the hallway and she said to me , " I 'm so ashamed to be a Catholic . The Vatican -- especially as an observer state -- has no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five had two simultaneous tracks of sessions : the UN General Assembly and the Committee of the Whole . The first included the scheduled testimony of 191 nations , five observers , and five NGOs . Initially only fifty passes were made available for the NGOs at the General Assembly , despite 400 available seats , but a protest eventually yielded more . The second track was the Committee of the Whole , consisting of meetings of both large and small groups of NGOs and others . Since it was not possible to attend both tracks in their entirety , I listened to only a few General Assembly speakers and then attended the committee meetings . ( The General Assembly speeches and other relevant documents are available on the United Nations Population Fund website : www.unfpa.org ; select ICPD+5 . ) <p> There was considerable drama at the various NGO meetings since , as of July 1 , there still was no final document to be presented to the General Assembly for a vote . So when the NGOs learned they would be not be allowed to make presentations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sent a unanimous resolution to Didier Opertti , president of the General Assembly Special Session . The resolution observed that NGOs had been " crucial to the implementation of the Cairo+5 process " and resolved that " the President and the Bureau of the General Assembly Special Session assure that NGOs have an opportunity to speak in a Plenary Session . " Three eventually did . <p> A second event on July 1 that signaled the NGOs ' dissatisfaction with the obstructive practices at this gathering was the terse but extremely direct remarks of Daniel C. Maguire , professor of theology at Marquette University , delivered before the Committee of the Whole . Maguire is a Catholic theologian trained at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and is president of the Religious Consultation on Population , Reproductive Health , and Ethics , an international NGO consisting of over 100 theologians of the world 's major and indigenous religions . He accused the Vatican of " misrepresentation of the Catholic traditions and teachings on abortion , " stating that the Catholic church " has always housed a pro-choice , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited as an example St. Antoninus , archbishop of Florence , " who in the fifteenth century defended a woman 's right to abortion if needed to save her life . " Maguire called upon Vatican officials to " stop their dogmatism , a dogmatism that offends many Catholics and most of the world 's religions . " He concluded by urging the Vatican to " surrender its privileged position at the United Nations . " The Holy See is the only religion that has Permanent Observer status at the UN . Maguire 's intervention was greeted with hearty applause . <p> A third event that day -- by far the most dramatic -- was the release of " An Open Letter to the Vatican , " initiated by women NGOs from Latin America and the Caribbean . In a series of direct and biting questions , they pressed the Vatican for answers : How can a church that holds life as a fundamental value be unmoved by the deaths of thousands of women , many of whom leave orphaned children ? Why do Vatican representatives insist that only parents can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual health of young people when it is widely known that many cases of sexual abuse , particularly incest , take place in the heart of the home ? Given that the Vatican is not a nation-state , is not involved in the implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action , and , by its very nature , does not have women or children or sexual or reproductive problems , why is the Vatican delegation interested in blocking advances in contraception , sexual education , and HIV prevention that are beneficial to millions of women , especially to millions of the world 's poorest women ? Why do Vatican representatives to this conference , who speak about the problems of migrants and allocation of resources and who insist on respect for national sovereignty , seek to impose their religious ideas and moral rules on a world that is plural and diverse in its beliefs ? <p> This letter was originally signed by forty-seven Latin American and Caribbean organizations , from Mexico to Chile . Eighty-one other international NGOs from the women 's coalition also supported the letter . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by Frances Kissling , who has long been a critic of Vatican policy on women 's reproductive rights ( including birth control and abortion ) and social justice issues . Her leadership at Cairo Plus Five was very evident , and it was obvious that she and her organization enjoyed a great deal of respect and support from the NCO delegates . Kissling invited me to a luncheon at the UN for progressive religious NGOs . Several of the seventeen people present -- including Buddhists , Muslims , Catholics , Protestants , and Jews -- lamented the fact that so often all religions are tarred with the same reactionary brush as the Vatican on population and development issues . Participants noted that in various traditions , such as Muslim and Catholic , there is a wide array of viewpoints on women , birth control , and abortion . Indeed , as one of the NCO plenary speakers stated , " The biggest Catholic countries are in consensus about what compassionate Catholicism means " and that today " the Holy See can no longer speak for most Catholics . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cairo Plus Five -- dawned , a final Programme of Action had not yet materialized . Clearly concerned that the Vatican 's obstructive practices might affect the success of this and future conferences , a letter signed by a vast majority of the NGOs was addressed to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan . The letter stated : <p> Regrettably , a process designed to be a review and appraisal of the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action has become a reassessment of the fundamentals that were resoundingly agreed and firmly established in Cairo .... We believe that the review and appraisal mandated by the General Assembly has been diverted from its original intention during the preparatory process that led to the conference . <p> The letter concluded by asking the secretary-general to hold a " consultation " to review Cairo Plus Five and what impact it would have on the World Summit of Social Development and the Beijing Platform for Action . Diplomatically speaking , this and our previous letter to Didier Opertti constituted an almost open rebellion . <p> So how many battalions did the Vatican have at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few but , by July 2 , the coalition of Catholic and Muslim delegations had collapsed . The Vatican 's alleged numerous NGOs at the conference surfaced visibly in force ( about twenty representatives ) only at a press briefing held with the U.S. Department of State across the street from the UN . But by late that afternoon , a final Programme of Action was approved . In the end , only Argentina , Nicaragua , and a few NGOs -- such as Right to Life International , the Catholic Family Rights Institute , and the Sovereign Military Order of Maltamstood with the Vatican to express " reservations " about the final document . Even the Muslims supported the Programme . The Vatican 's battalions were in retreat -- and bitter retreat at that . <p> In a most interesting final intervention , Archbishop Renato R. Martino , head of the Holy See delegation , actually accused others of seeking to undo the ICPD . He observed that negotiations at the Hague forum took <p> a step backward , placing unbalanced emphasis on population issues at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it particularly disconcerting that some delegations , mainly from Western states , have sought in these negotiations to undo the careful balancing needed between adolescents ' need for privacy and confidentiality with parental rights , duties , and responsibilities-prior rights as affirmed in the Declaration on Human Rights . <p> After noting the Holy See 's reservations to the approved final document , Martino stated , " This does not mean that the Holy See can simply walk away from the work begun in Cairo , the work proceeding here and which will continue into the future . " But " walk away " is just what a great many NGOs want the Vatican to do . <p> So was Cairo Plus Five a success ? By all accounts it was . In his summary remarks to the General Assembly , Ambassador Anwarul Karim Chowhury of Bangladesh , president of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the special session , noted that reaching consensus had been " extraordinarily difficult " because delegates " repeatedly ran into contentious issues " in the course of negotiations . He noted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts , and gives direction on how to proceed for achieving more . " Specifically , Chowhury noted that Cairo Plus Five led to a <p> focus on attaining more in our efforts for equality and empowerment of women ... emphatic pronouncements for women 's rights ... strong language for enduring discrimination against the girl child ... benefits of public-private partnership and collaboration with civil society . <p> Translation : the progressive forces won . <p> In the General Assembly , nation after nation affirmed the final Programme of Action and many commented on their own programs to limit population growth through development . NGOs -- especially women 's organizations -- overwhelmingly supported Cairo Plus Five and can take real satisfaction in knowing that , although the job has only begun , it is off to a good start . <p> And , above all , it will continue . <p> By Joseph J.

##4001065 Section : Creative Controversy <p> In keeping with the policy of the Humanist to accommodate the diverse social , political , and philosophical viewpoints of its readers , this occasional feature allows for the expression of alter . native and dissenting views on issues previously discussed within these pages . <p> HUMANIST MANIFESTO II , first published in 1973 , outlines a humanistic world vision to help guide humankind toward the future . Building on the dramatic advances in science , technology , and evolving social and political changes , the manifesto declares that the next century should be the " humanistic century . " Among the seventeen principles affirmed is a call " to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and move toward the building of a world community in which all sectors of the human family can participate . " As we rapidly approach the new millennium , we need to examine the factors influencing the current international environment and seek to answer the following question : is the world community poised to make the next century the humanistic century ? THE QUESTION OF CULTURE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world order based upon a transnational federal government that would appreciate diversity , cultural pluralism , and pride in national origin -- in effect , a global government grounded on a system of world law . Is this actually a feasible notion in today 's international environment ? With the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War , the bipolar -- and arguably more stable -- world in which we had grown accustomed to living ceased to exist . In its place is a much less predictable , more multipolar world -- one with many new actors now playing on the world stage . <p> Each of these actors possesses a unique cultural identity . But whose culture ? Culture -- or civilization , if one prefers -- encompasses the basic ways of a people that resist alteration and remain significant to following generations . Culture includes the shared norms , values , language , history , science , art , and religious views of a group . And unlike the relatively youthful nation-state system around which our modern world affairs revolve , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humankind in the post-Cold War environment , Samuel P. Huntington hypothesizes in his summer 1993 Foreign Affairs article " The Clash of the Civilizations " that the fundamental source of future world conflict will primarily be cultural and between groups of different civilizations -- not exclusively between nation-states . Cultural identification does n't necessarily confine itself neatly within the borders of the established states but may transcend state borders , as is the case in the Balkans , or may include several nation-states , such as the Arab civilization . <p> How might culture be a source of future conflict ? The reasons are varied and may include differing views over politics , economics , and ethnicity , just to name a few . Perhaps the most compelling source , though , is religion . Each culture produces its own fundamental views of religion , and many of these views are the result of centuries in the making . <p> In the history of humanity , perhaps no other catalyst has generated the level of violence and conflict as has religion . Although differing religious views in and of themselves may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look around the globe at several contemporary conflicts gives one pause to reflect otherwise . For instance : Catholic and Orthodox Christians fighting in the Balkans , both of them fighting Muslims ( and , most recently , Orthodox Christians carrying out near genocide against Muslims in Kosovo ) ; Muslims and Hindus fighting in India ; Muslims and Christians fighting in Egypt , Algeria , Azerbaijan , Indonesia , and Nigeria ; Christians and Muslims fighting in Lebanon ; Sunni Muslims and Shiites fighting in Iraq ; and Shiites and Baha'is fighting in Iran . The list goes on . <p> Cultural clashes and the seeming inability of humanity to overcome them present a daunting challenge for the future . In his winter 1996 Washington Quarterly article " Conflicts After the Cold War , " Joseph S. Nye Jr . maintains that cultural clashes can occur at three levels : over transnational identity , such as religion ; over national identity , as in Russia ; and on subnational identity based on linguistic , religious , or ethnic divisions , as in Africa or the former Yugoslavia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solutions to reduce this cultural strife at all three levels must first be found . IS WAR REALLY OBSOLETE ? <p> Humanist Manifesto II proclaims that the world community must renounce the resort to violence and force in solving international disputes and declares war and the use of weapons of mass destruction obsolete . Unfortunately , the world remains a very dangerous place and conflict abounds . In international relations theory , there are primarily two world views that help explain conflict : realism and liberalism . Realists assert that conflict results as states struggle with one another over power and security concerns in an anarchic world -- a world where there is no higher authority or ultimate arbiter . They claim that human beings have an instinctive desire to dominate each other and believe the furthering of national interests is supreme . Leery of international institutions or the idea of collective security , realists seek to tilt the balance of power in their favor . <p> Liberals , on the other hand , contend that conflict is not only influenced by power struggles but determined by the domestic structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the belief in the democratic ideal . In effect , democratic states do n't go to war with one another ; rather , they rely on negotiation and dialogue to solve differences . Liberals believe international commerce and trade promote peace and maintain that international institutions increase the cooperation between nation-states . <p> According to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict , following the thawing of the Cold War in the years 1990-1997 , there were thirty-nine major world conflicts in which at least 1,000 deaths occurred in any one year . Although most scholars and policymakers agree the potential for global conflict has significantly lessened in today 's international environment , they also agree that great uncertainties still abound . Many world " hot spots " exist that could quickly escalate into small-scale or regional war . <p> For example , striving for self-determination , twenty million Kurds -- the largest ethnic group in the world without their own state -- are vying for a Kurdistan homeland carved from the countries of Iran , Iraq , Syria , and Turkey . In the former Soviet Union , Chechnya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much anxiety lingers . The Arab-Israeli dispute remains a tinderbox in spite of extraordinary efforts to mediate events . India and Pakistan , the newest members of the nuclear club , have fought three wars and the Kashmir issue is still unresolved . Tensions continue to be high on the Korean Peninsula-as well as between China and Taiwan . Iraq remains a threat to its Middle East neighbors . The crisis in the Balkans and collapse of states in central Africa also give great pause for concern . <p> Always a contentious issue because of their horrific destructive potential , chemical , biological , and nuclear weapon concerns are of particular interest in today 's world . On the subject of nuclear weapons , John F. Spoko writes in his winter 1996-1997 Foreign Policy article " The Changing Proliferation Threat " : <p> The familiar balance of nuclear terror that linked the superpowers and their client states for nearly 50 years in a choreographed series of confrontations has given way to a much less predictable situation where weapons of unthinkable power appear within the grasp of those willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrorist groups , religious cults , ethnic minorities , disaffected political groups , and even individuals appear to have joined a new arms race toward mass destruction . <p> Fearful of being on the receiving end of an attack , nuclear-capable nations are going to be hard-pressed to completely eliminate their arsenal of weapons due to their perceived deterrent value . On the positive side , since 1989 the stockpile of Russian and U.S. nuclear warheads has been reduced by half , and when all three strategic arms reduction treaties ( START ) are implemented , roughly 80 percent of their strategic nuclear arsenals will be gone . Since both nations have signed the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty , calling for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons , the START treaties are a key milestone in achieving a major principle of Humanist Manifesto IL <p> Unfortunately , the same can not be said of chemical and biological weapons . Known as the " poor man 's nuke , " these weapons do n't require the level of sophistication to manufacture as do nuclear weapons and , although many nations ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the outlook for their total elimination in the near future is far bleaker . Any rogue nation or faction that so desires can easily obtain weapons of this sort . <p> Is war really obsolete ? In theory , yes ; in reality , no . But this question does give rise to a third international relations world view : idealism , or globalism . Idealists view the world as a global community . Within the community , global institutions are formed leading to cooperation , security , and collective action . They believe in the universal rule of law and the rights of individuals everywhere . If this world view can ultimately be achieved in the next century , conceivably war may then become truly obsolete . SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL SECURITY <p> Perhaps the biggest challenges in fulfilling the aims of Humanist Manifesto II are the issues of national sovereignty and national security . In the foreseeable future , it is difficult to imagine the international security environment evolving in such a manner that nations , such as the United States , would actually give up some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world community is steadily moving in the direction of more cooperative intergovernmental relationships -- including the increased interaction of nongovernmental organizations , transnational corporations , and academia -- the circumstances to transcend the limits of national sovereignty have not yet been achieved . <p> Humanist Manifesto II maintains that it is a planetary imperative to reduce the level of military expenditures and direct this money toward more peaceful purposes . As the world 's only remaining superpower , the United States maintains a sizable military force . Yet according to recent polling data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research , nearly 75 percent of Americans feel the level of defense spending should remain at its current level and an additional 17 percent think it should be increased . It is important to note , however , that , as a result of the post-Cold War " peace dividend , " the United States , like many other nations , has already substantially reduced its defense expenditures and shifted this revenue into domestic and social programs . <p> Fundamental to humanist philosophy , and essential in the humanistic century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central premise in the guarantee of global human rights is a more open and democratic world . Promoting democracy abroad is one of three core objectives President Clinton says the United States seeks through its national security strategy . As a world leader , the United States must play a major role in spreading democratic ideals throughout the world , but can the democratic ground already won around the globe be maintained if the U.S. military does n't remain strong ? Can international security organizations fill the vacuum if the armed forces of the United States and other democratic nations are marginalized by further reductions in force and capability ? CONCLUSION <p> Is the world poised for the humanistic century ? In my opinion , not as described in Humanist Manifesto II and not in the immediate future . As the manifesto states , not everyone who endorses its content agrees with every detail . I 'm not convinced that we have reached a point in human history where the best option is to transcend national sovereignty . The world remains a dangerous and capricious place with widely divergent ideological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences and achieve a greater degree of harmony must be demonstrated before we can move forward . <p> Perhaps humankind 's best course of action is for the world 's democratic states to maintain as much dialogue as possible with other nondemocratic states . The recent addition of three former Warsaw Pact nations -- Hungary , Poland , and the Czech Republic -- to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization demonstrates how the spread of democratic values and political and economic freedom can help lead the world in a direction more in line with humanist thought . It is in this sense that the next century has the potential to be the humanistic century . <p> Editor 's note : In our September/October and November/December 1998 issues , we published a twenty-fifth anniversary symposium on Humanist Manifesto II that analyzes the document and suggests changes . Then , in our July/August 1999 issue , we boldly proposed that humanity can end war in the next century .

##4001066 Section : CIVIL LIBERTIES WATCH <p> On June 17 , by a 248 to 180 vote , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill permitting states to display the Ten Commandments in public schools . At a press conference , a cosponsor of the bill , Georgia Republican Bob Barr , said that if the Ten Commandments had been posted at Columbine High School the April 20 massacre never would have occurred . The bill 's primary sponsor , Alabama Republican Robert Aderholt , called it " a first step " in " reinstilling the value of human life . " <p> This ridiculous measure has now gone to the Senate , where its chances of actual passage are slim . And I 'm sure most readers know that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled definitively that it is not permissible to post the Ten Commandments in public schools . <p> So how is it possible that 248 members of the House could do a thing like this ? How is it that these legislators , along with more than a billion people across the globe ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universalists ) , firmly believe that the basic guidelines for civil society are encapsulated in these ten biblical pronouncements ? Perhaps more to the point , where could anyone get the absurd idea that the Ten Commandments instill " the value of human life " ? <p> Yet it is because of these widely held beliefs that civil libertarians must exert the energy and suffer the frustration of repeatedly countering government advocacy of the Ten Commandments on obvious church-state separation grounds . And that 's why I think it 's time to change our strategy and challenge the actual content of this and similar proposals involving scriptural injunctions . <p> The truth is that none of the commandments have anything positive to say about the value of human life . Not only does the Decalogue not teach this , it bluntly tells people to devalue their own lives , as well as the lives of their fellow human beings . The blatantly obvious and straightforward presentation of this message in the Ten Commandments leaves me convinced that the reason millions of people accept religionists ' false claims about them is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe for correction by freethinkers . Who better to focus the light of reason and common sense on the true nature of religious doctrine ? <p> To begin , then , the Bible itself contains at least two different versions of these " rules written in stone . " There are also numerous English translations from the original Hebrew . These deviations present serious problems in and of themselves . To keep this simple , I 'll quote the Protestant King James Version and the wording of the commandments as found in Exodus 20:1-17 . ( A variant wording appears in Deuteronomy 5:6-21 while a significantly different Ten Commandments shows up in Exodus 34:1-28 . ) And I 'll number the commandments the way Christians do instead of the way Jews do , assuming they 've been revealed to us in their order of importance . <p> The first commandment states : " Thou shalt have no other gods before me . " Now that seems pretty clear . The most important requirement for living a moral life on Earth is that we bow down before one particular god and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the age-old arguments , pogroms , and religious wars over which god is the " true " god , it instructs us , first and foremost , to abdicate our freedom , our self-responsibility , our very lives to some invisible supernatural entity . Yes indeed , the value of human life certainly resonates in this one ! <p> The second commandment , in short form , reads : " Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image . " But in the Bible it goes on : " or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth : Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them . " While there are many interpretations of these directives by various religious factions , let 's assume the simplest meaning : " Do n't make images of anything and do n't worship images of anything . " Now why should this be the second most important moral principle for all humanity to follow ? Robert Ingersoll noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Killing art is hardly a way to promote the value of human life . <p> God establishes a special punishment for disobedience of this commandment that , amazingly , never shows up in any of those tidy schoolhouse lists of the Ten Commandments . This is a particularly foolhardy omission given the extreme consequences of insubordination . As part of his commandment , God says , " For I , the Lord thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me " -- this is the stick , followed by the carrot -- " and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments . " <p> Yes , indeed , instilling the value of human life is obviously what 's going on here ! All the way down to and including the innocent great , great grandchildren of anyone who disobeys this all-important commandment of human morality . What could be more obviously godlike and supremely just than inflicting a family curse on four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and maybe even admired them . And , gosh , is n't jealousy an exemplary emotion for a perfect God to so proudly proclaim ? <p> The third commandment states : " Thou shalt not take the name of the do n't say " Christ Almighty ! " We must n't be uttering any of his proper names in any context other than respectful reverence-since proper decorum here is so critical to the morality of all humanity . <p> Knowing the origin of this commandment , and the previous one , is helpful here . That origin can be found in sympathetic magic , where an image or name of a person is believed to carry part of her or his soul . Any injury to the image or denouncement of the name is thought to produce a consequent injury to the person . By making it taboo for people to create graven images or to utter curses against names , enemies are denied powerful , secret weapons . Some ancient peoples went further , believing that natural disasters were caused by misusing the names of gods . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy . " But there 's much more to it that must be examined : <p> Six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work : But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work ; thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates : For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it . <p> If the worst this commandment did was promote the silliness of " creation science , " we could consider ourselves fortunate . But Violation of this commandment could prove fatal . <p> Throughout the Old Testament , many acts prohibited on the sabbath are specifically spelled out -- along with the penalty , which is death by stoning . Numbers 15:32-36 recounts one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day . " So every seventh calendar day , you must do no work . Your animals must do no work . Even your slaves must do no work . Yes , that 's what manservants and maidservants were -- slaves . ( This is one of two times slavery is tacitly endorsed in the actual body of the Ten Commandments . ) Clearly , this commandment joins the first three in instilling the value of human life ! <p> The fifth commandment reads : " Honor thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee . " The land referred to is the " Promised Land , " which was the bond between the " Chosen People " and their God . There fore , any breakdown in the family , in tribal solidarity -- especially if caused by a family member following other gods or marrying outside the faith -- could theoretically jeopardize the tribe 's right to the land and , hence , its relationship with the deity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was death ( see Deuteronomy 13:6-11 ) . <p> In Leviticus 19:3 we are told that everyone is to fear their mother and father in the same way they fear God . Parents thus become vice-regents of the Almighty . No exceptions to the fifth commandment are noted , so even severe physical , emotional , or sexual abuse at the hands of one 's parents would n't alter one 's responsibility to " honor " them . <p> Now we 've made our way down to the short " shalt nots " that most people think of when the subject of the Decalogue comes up . These are the sixth , seventh , and eighth commandments . Thou shalt not : kill ( unless , of course , God tells you to , which he frequently does in the Bible ) ; commit adultery ( which , though punishable by death in Leviticus and Deuteronomy , has been interpreted differently by different sects -- given all the philandering by biblical heroes , the polygamy practiced by some of the Israelites , and the use of harems by biblical kings ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous two , is problematic because God does n't supply any guidelines for applying it . But if we turn to Proverbs 6:30-31 , we find the punishment harsh and absolute : " Men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ; But if he be found , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of his house . " <p> The ninth commandment says : " Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor . " If you think this embodies a basically sound moral principle , note the last three words . They make it clear that this commandment was n't designed for universal application . <p> Under Talmudic law , only a fellow Hebrew was a neighbor . Indeed , as Joseph Lewis wrote in The Ten Commandments , " All the Commandments belong in the same category and were promulgated for one purpose -- to prevent injury to the clan and to promote tribal solidarity . " One could willfully violate the commandments where " foreigners " were concerned . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the ninth commandment more broadly , it still fails to enjoin general lying or advance general honesty . This is because , taken literally , it only prohibits false testimony against another person . There is no commandment against lying , per se . <p> Finally , we come to the tenth commandment . In short form , it reads : " Thou shalt not covet . " But the verse goes on to say , " thy neighbor 's house ... thy neighbor 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbor 's . " Again , this only relates to one 's " neighbor " ( and it constitutes another tacit endorsement of men owning wives and slaves ) . <p> But suppose we actually applied it more generally , what then ?

Has it occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would virtually require the United States to adopt a communist or socialist economic system ?

So long as no one challenges the content of religious pronouncements like the Ten Commandments , we 'll continue to divert time and energy from important matters to counter the attempts of conservative religionists to force biblical law on American society .

##4000077 Research on Kona slope shows promise for native ecosystem recovery <p> A half-dozen black feral goats looked up with a start as Robert Cabin emerged from the stand of trees . Wild and wary , they had been scrounging for food in the rough lava field on the Kona slope of the island of Hawaii . <p> " There 's the enemy right there , " said Cabin ( pronounced CAY-bin ) , a plant ecologist with the US Forest Service 's Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry , in Hilo . Almost before he got the words out , the goats turned and darted over a ridge and out of view . <p> Goats , pigs , and other feral ungulates , or hooved animals , are " the enemy " on the Big Island and elsewhere in Hawaii because these alien ( nonnative ) species wreak havoc on forests and other ecosystems , eating native plants and digging up soil . Ungulates are a major reason Hawaii is the extinction capital of the United States . With less than 1 percent of the US land mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's endangered and rare species . More than 1000 native Hawaiian species are known to be extinct . <p> The particular ecosystem that concerns Cabin is the tropical dry forest . The dry forests of Hawaii receive about 20 inches of rain a year , while rain forests can get about 10 times as much . On the Hawaiian Islands , feral ungulates , cattle ranching , alien grasses , and other biological insults have eliminated 90 percent of the state 's original dry forests . By comparison , about 40 percent of Hawaii 's rain forests are gone . <p> But here at a region called Kaupulehu , Cabin and fellow biologists and conservationists have begun an important demonstration project for reclaiming Hawaii 's degraded dry forests . The demonstration site is protected from ungulates by a fence . In just a few years of research at the site , the biologists have begun to assemble much-needed information about how degraded forests respond to fencing out the enemy and about what other steps may be necessary for restoring the forests . <p> " We 're standing among all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabin said in June as he led a journalist through the upper part of the site . The upper part , called Kaupulehu mauka , is separated from the lower section by the main highway running upslope from the resort area of Kailua-Kona . The scene is sobering . Kaupulehu mauka , a mere six-acre fenced area , is one of the few remnants of the hundreds of thousands of acres of tropical dry forest that once blanketed the lowland leeward slopes of all the Hawaiian Islands . Many of these areas are slowly degrading , victims of alien animals and plants and the rogue fires that come with them . <p> Yet in just 3 years of weed whacking , spraying with herbicide , and other toil on these sun-baked slopes , Cabin and his colleagues have seen signs that the forest-with a little help-can restore itself . At the study site , native tree seedlings , shrubs , and vines are rising anew out of the shallow soil and rough lava amid dead , gray clumps of the invasive African bunch grass known as fountain grass ( Pennisetum setaceum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives are popping up here and there , regenerating on their own , " Cabin said . A devastated ecosystem <p> The devastation of dry forests is a common story everywhere in the tropics . They have succumbed to a modern-day crescendo of extinction that began with the original human settlement and grew with Western contact , large-scale ranching , and a rising tide of development . In Hawaii 's case , habitat degradation by alien ungulates was-and still is-the crowning blow . <p> Dry forest is one of the Hawaiian Islands ' most culturally important and critically endangered habitats . Native Hawaiians use plants from the forest for everything from medicines to building materials . Throughout the tropics , dry forest regions often were the first to be settled and their resources the first to be consumed . That was largely because these areas were the most hospitable in terms of climate and disease and offered fertile soil and accessible resources . <p> Hawaii 's native species , which evolved amid the oceanic isolation of the mid-Pacific islands , did n't need to adapt to a wide range of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , they were particularly vulnerable to disturbance by late-arriving alien species . Dry forest species were among the hardest hit , mainly because the forests were so accessible as habitat . " What 's left today are these tiny little fragments of dry forest , and we 're standing in one of the best in the state , " Cabin said . " It 's just this little bread crumb of what was . " <p> Behind him , down the parched slope to the North Kona beach resorts nearly 2000 feet below , spread an ecological desert , a barren carpet of black lava and sandy-colored alien grass dotted with single trees , many of them nonnative . Despite what today seems like an austere environment-hot and dry-North Kona , like the lowland dry side of all the Hawaiian islands , was once among the most species-rich areas in the state . <p> To try to reverse the all but completed trend of dry-forest destruction , a group of scientists , conservationists , and volunteers formed the North Kona Dry Forest Working Group in 1993 . The group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , botanical gardens , and native Hawaiian and other local residents . Lisa Hadway , formerly a researcher at the National Tropical Botanical Garden ( NTBG ) , on Kauai , is coordinator . <p> The working group is confronting one of the fundamental challenges of conservation biology : restoring a native ecosystem without quite understanding how it functions , much less the precise details of what species and ecological linkages it contained before degradation began . Researchers know little about Hawaii 's dry forests , especially about how the ecosystem operates across the Kona landscape 's patchwork of different lava flows . <p> This challenge typifies the so-called Nero dilemma of conservation biology . Conservation biology project leaders can choose to make immediate tactical decisions about a conservation problem before they know all of the problem 's complex dimensions and range of solutions , or they can wait until all the data are in-that is , like Nero , they can fiddle while Rome burns . But the North Kona working group believes it has the tools to stop fiddling and start fighting the fire . Through research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered and rare species , mainly plants , can be recovered once the overall structure of the forest is restored . Kaupulehu still supports small populations of the endangered plants kauila ( Colubrina oppositifolia ) , uhiuhi ( Caesalpinia kavaiensis ) , aiea ( Nothocestrum breviflorum ) , kokio ( Kokia drynarioides ) , and hala pepe ( Pleomele hawaiiensis ) . <p> " This project is a wonderful example of integration of scientific experimentation and on-the-ground management , " says Marie Bruegmann , a biologist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) in Honolulu and one of the working group members . " The work that Bob Cabin and Lisa Hadway are doing with research grant funding gives us a scientific basis for making management decisions . While members of the group do n't always agree on what should be done or how , we work through these issues and continue to make progress . " <p> The group 's work includes " outplanting " hundreds of individuals of federally endangered dry forest species-that is , transplanting nursery-raised individuals to protected areas . The work is funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FWS , NTBG , and other sources . In July , FWS added $72,000 to boost the effort , hoping to provide habitat for the endangered Blackburn 's sphinx moth ( Manduca blackburni ) , the state 's largest native insect . Fences and fires <p> The spot from which the goats fled was at the uppermost edge of Kaupulehu mauka , just beyond the fence . From this location , the meaning of an ungulate-excluding fence for native species in Hawaii was clear : On one side were at least some signs of native plant life ; on the opposite side , seemingly nothing . <p> The site was chosen by the working group largely because it had been fenced 40 years earlier by the Territory of Hawaii , protecting it from damage by feral ungulates . " It 's not entirely clear why they fenced it , " Cabin said . " Somebody just took it upon themselves to do it . Now this is one of the only dry forest pieces that 's been fenced for any length of time in the state . " <p> The fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving , and other forms of clearing that destroyed dry forest elsewhere . But it was luck that kept the site from succumbing to fire . In the past few years , dozens of fires have raged across the North Kona slopes , taking with them many of the last few fragments of dry forest . Fountain grass , an extremely flammable and invasive alien species , is the primary culprit in Hawaii 's relatively new history of fire , a history that has been devastating to dry forest remnants . <p> Researchers believe that fires were rare in the past , and that most were probably ignited by lava , not lightning . Without the grass-layer fuel of today , those fires that did occur were probably quite localized . Native plant species therefore did not need to adapt to fire , so today they do n't recover from it easily , if at all . Even if the plants do come back , they must contend with goats , fountain grass , and other invasive alien species . In short , a fire today generally spells the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest down there burned a couple years ago last fall , " Cabin said , pointing down the slope and to the north . " There was a huge fire on this whole side of the island . It jumped the highway in several places and burned a lot of the last pieces left . " Kaupulehu mauka was spared because it borders a lava flow dating from 1801 that serves as a natural firebreak . <p> Kaupulehu mauka was rife with fountain grass until 1996 , when Cabin and his colleagues began a campaign to wrest it out . " That and fire breaks are a big part of what we do now , " he said . " It 's just to keep this area from burning . When it has n't burned for a while and there 's been rain , the fountain grass can be neck high . And it 's just as dry as tinder . So when the winds pick up , it 's just a tremendous tinder box . " Overcoming rodents and grass <p> The research arm of the working group began its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The study , the results of which were published in Conservation Biology in April 2000 , was conducted by Cabin , Hadway , Stephen Weller and Ann Sakai of the University of California- Irvine , David Lorence and Tim Flynn of NTBG , and Darren Sandquist of Stanford University . <p> The biologists began by comparing regeneration of canopy trees in the preserve with that in an adjacent , unfenced area that had been grazed continuously . They found the unfenced area all but devoid of trees and shrubs . The preserve had many older trees of several native species , but a census found almost no native canopy tree seedlings in the study plots of the protected site-this after more than 40 years of potential recovery time . <p> Cabin and his colleagues suspected that native tree regeneration had been kept in check largely by small alien animals and fountain grass . Three species of nonnative rodents thrived on the site : the mouse ( Mus musculus ) , black rat ( Rattus rattus ) , and Polynesian rat ( Rattus exulans ) . And fountain grass covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . <p> The researchers proposed that these invasive alien species played a major role in suppressing canopy tree regeneration-the rodents decimating the natural rain of seeds in the plot and the grass smothering any seedlings that might have successfully run the rodent gauntlet and sprouted . <p> To test these ideas , they placed bait traps with rodenticide throughout the six-acre site . They also painstakingly weed-whacked all the fountain grass , sprayed each remaining clump six separate times with a grass-specific herbicide to kill any newly emerging grass , and pulled out as many clumps as possible . They recorded subsequent developments within the reserve and in the adjacent unprotected , untreated area . <p> By 1996 , the grass was reduced to only 10 percent of the pretreatment cover . Detailed rodent population data were not collected , but the researchers observed a general decline in activity by rats and mice , resulting partly from the rodenticide and partly from drought , they believe . <p> By 1997 , canopy tree seedlings had taken a dramatic hold in the preserve . For example , the number of seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so hard that native Hawaiians once used it for house rafters , jumped from zero in 1996 to 838 a year later in the site 's 53 study plots . <p> The main conclusion of the study is that the dry forest needs a helping hand in overcoming not only damage done by ungulates but also the choking effects of fountain grass and , possibly , damage from seed-consuming rodents . " Removing ungulates is a necessary and critical first step , but it is not sufficient in itself , " Cabin said . " Putting up a fence and walking away wo n't cut it . You 've got to do more . " Indeed , spraying and clump pulling continued , and by mid-2000 the grass covered only 4 percent of the site . <p> The regeneration heartened working group members and local resident volunteers , who , along with school groups , began to flock to the site to help plant seedlings and pull fountain grass on weekend work parties . " We had a lot of trees that people who had lived here all their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought , ' Hey , this is it . You fence it , you get rid of the fountain grass , you poison the rats , and the system recovers . ' We got all excited . " <p> But rain had been plentiful in 1997 , and when a severe drought hit the next year , regeneration slowed dramatically . The researchers realized that with the original forest and its lower layer of shrubs and herbaceous plants long gone , the site had lost its " microclimate protection , " as Cabin put it . In other words , the preserve was still extremely vulnerable to periodic regimes of hot , dry weather , and when it comes to restoration , " shade matters , " Cabin said . <p> " We 're realizing now that it 's more complicated than we ever thought , and we 've got to do more , depending on the weather , " he said . The biologists have begun a series of experiments comparing regeneration in plots with and without drip-line irrigation . <p> Meanwhile , they are monitoring invasion by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as the native plants do . In the study published in April , the researchers found 16 nonnative plants new to the preserve . " One of the species that 's really come in heavy in some places is this guy , " said Cabin , walking over to a milkweed plant and pulling it up . Milkweed was brought to Hawaii by an aficionado of monarch butterflies , which rely on milkweed as a host plant . " You 'll see monarchs flittering all around here , laying their eggs , " Cabin said . " The plant looks pretty innocent here , but there are places up the road where it 's just ' milkweed forest , ' where it 's 12-feet-high solid milkweed . " <p> For about 2 years , the biologists studied the invasion of milkweed , thistle , and other alien plants at the site to document how they competed with native species . " On the one hand , it would be really fascinating to just step back and see the natives and the alien species kind of fight it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cabin said . " But from a restoration and political point of view , this forest is too valuable to do that . " So the working group now removes nonnative plants as frequently as possible . Searching for new methods <p> Below the highway , in the lower part of Kaupulehu , the working group in 1995 began work at a second site , a 70-acre dry forest patch known as Kaupulehu makai . <p> The focus at this site is larger-scale restoration demonstration and experiments . Group members want to show that dry forest can be protected from fire and restored using economical methods . Row after row of test plots spread across the site , around which a large fence and firebreaks have been constructed . Among other experimental variations , some plots have been irrigated , some covered with shade cloth , some outplanted with native tree seedlings , and some directly seeded . <p> " We want to come up with coarser , more efficient , bigger-scale projects , " Cabin said . The researchers hope that such projects will help the working group persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least one local rancher has shown interest in the group 's activities . But members acknowledge that building relationships with local landowners will be difficult , largely because of the history of polarization between many ranchers and environmentalists . <p> The working group has organized field trips to Kaupulehu for schools and local residents . Interest has grown , but the project must still overcome a widely held attitude that restoring the system is hopeless . That 's why demonstration is so important . <p> Despite learning much , the researchers admit they have a long way to go . Basic questions they are studying include the role of soil organisms and the physiology of key tree species , to better understand the ecological factors involved in regeneration . On a more practical research level , they have studied whether spraying herbicide from helicopters can kill fountain grass on a large scale ( it ca n't ) and whether the controversial approach of turning over the fountain grass-choked landscape with a bulldozer might give native plants an advantage . <p> Beyond these questions of how to restore the Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What exactly was the Hawaiian dry forest ecosystem ? If the biologists ca n't answer this question , how can they be sure that , if left alone , the system will regenerate into what it was before ? " Because nothing is left of any size , we do n't know what the model is to restore to , and that 's a big problem , both biologically and philosophically , " Cabin said . " Should you just do what works ? Should you try to restore in some image of what you think was here ? " <p> He bent down and pulled at another clump of dead fountain grass as vehicles whizzed past on the highway a hundred meters or so above him . " You could n't create a perfect replica of what was here if you wanted to , " he said . " The system has changed . The soil is all fountain grass litter . The dispersal agents in this system-the birds-are gone . Rats are here to stay . For me , as a pragmatist , I say forget about trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinctions right and left , we 've got new species that are here to stay . Let 's do what works . " The important point , say working group members , is that the dry forest can come back . <p> Table 1 . Federally endangered dry forest species to be outplanted in the Kaupulehu preserve .

##4000078 The biological diversity within soils and sediments may be orders of magnitude greater than that above the surface , but it has not been fully documented in any system ( Anderson 1995 , Wall Freckman et al . 1997 ) . In soils , only an estimated 10% of protozoa and 5% of mite species have been taxonomically described ( Brussaard et al . 1997 ) , and in marine sediments , Snelgrove et al . ( 1997 ) estimate that just 0.1% of species are described . <p> Although the identity of the vast majority of species in soil and sediments is unknown , we do know that assemblages of species ( " functional groups " ) regulate vital ecosystem processes such as decomposition of wastes , renewal of soil fertility , and purification of water ( Brussaard et al . 1997 , Palmer et al . 1997 , Snelgrove et al . 1997 , Covich et al . 1999 , Groffman and Bohlen 1999 , Snelgrove 1999 ) . A major scientific challenge is to evaluate the significance of the great diversity of life in soils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , we must identify " keystone " species ( those species that have a disproportionately large effect on ecosystem functioning ) and how soil and sediment biodiversity and the ecosystem functions they regulate respond to environmental or disturbance gradients . <p> In 1995 the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment ( SCOPE ) established the Committee on Soil and Sediment Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning ( SSBEF ) to synthesize available information and identify gaps in knowledge and research needs in this area . The first meeting of the SSBEF committee revealed the great extent to which activities of organisms dwelling within soils and sediments or the litter layer ( here defined as below-surface biota ) involve physiological or ecological interactions with organisms in above-surface habitats ( e.g. , the vegetation , the water column , or even the watershed for freshwater sediment organisms ) . These cross-surface interactions include decomposition of leaves by invertebrates and microbes in soils and sediments , nutrient cycling from below-surface bacteria to macrophytes and phytoplankton , mutualistic interactions between mycorrhizae and plants , and predator-prey interactions . Importantly , this interconnectivity appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all three domains : terrestrial , freshwater , and marine ( Wall Freckman et al . 1997 ) . However , the significance of biological diversity for this connectivity , and whether the ecological and physiological connections couple the biodiversity above and below the surface of soils or sediments , could not be ascertained at the first workshop . Synthesizing knowledge of the connections between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity was considered a priority to be addressed at a second workshop , since it would help to yield information on keystone species and interactions in ecosystem processes assess the extent of species specificity and , conversely , species redundancy in ecosystem processes , allowing improved estimates of the processes ' susceptibility to biodiversity loss yield a more accurate picture of overall biodiversity patterns and hotspots , which are currently defined primarily by biodiversity above the soil or sediment surface identify beneficial associations between species , functional groups , and biodiversity across the soil or sediment surface that could aid land management and restoration techniques improve our estimates of global change scenarios by increasing predictive understanding of how global changes occurring above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities <p> The papers in this special issue result from the second workshop of the SCOPE SSBEF committee in Lunteren , The Netherlands , 11-16 October 1998 , at which over 40 ecologists and taxonomists with expertise in soils and marine and freshwater sediments assembled to synthesize knowledge on the linkages between biodiversity above and below the surface of soils and sediments . The first three papers reveal , for terrestrial ( Hooper et al . 2000 ) , freshwater ( Palmer et al . 2000 ) , and marine ( Snelgrove et al . 2000 ) domains , some evidence for correlations between biodiversity above and below the surface ( e.g. , similar biogeographical trends or responses to disturbance ) . They identify four primary mechanisms , shared across all domains , that can directly couple functional groups and , to a lesser extent , species above and below the surface . However , the authors also report some evidence against , and mechanisms that may limit , correlations between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity . The final three papers predict that global change will exert large effects on biodiversity within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sediments ( Lake et al . 2000 ) , and marine sediments ( Smith et al . 2000 ) by altering resource supply from above the surface and disrupting specific biotic interactions . By analyzing the feedbacks between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity , the papers provide a more complete framework for assessing scenarios of global change than do studies that examine above-surface or below-surface responses alone . Correlations between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity <p> Whether patterns of above-surface and below-surface biodiversity are correlated across space and time will depend on similarities in their response to environmental gradients or disturbance and the nature of interactions among biota across the soil and sediment surface . Some factors will promote correlations whereas others will limit their expression ( Box 1 ) . In all domains , participants found evidence both for and against correlations in above-surface and below-surface biodiversity ( Box 2 ) . Comparisons of biodiversity patterns are hampered by extremely limited knowledge of below-surface biodiversity , especially at large spatial scales and particularly in sediments . Ecological mechanisms <p> Across terrestrial , freshwater , and marine domains , four primary mechanisms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interface may influence biodiversity at the other : Resource supply : Primary producers and decomposers play a vital role in connecting above- and below-surface organisms through resource supply . Timing , amount , and quality of these resources can be key variables determining community composition across the surface interface . In general , the presence of a resource across the interface enhances biodiversity relative to when the resource is absent . However , an overabundant supply of a resource , or toxic substances associated with some producers , can decrease diversity of the consumer community across the surface interface . For example , toxic algal blooms can reduce diversity of sediment biota ( Palmer et al . 2000 , Snelgrove et al . 2000 ) , and terrestrial plant community diversity may decrease with enhanced nutrient availability ( Hooper et al . 2000 ) . Physical and structural habitat heterogeneity : Organisms such as macrophytes , burrowing animals , and large animals that wade , wallow , or dig can increase the structural heterogeneity of soils and sediments , which is generally believed to increase the biotic diversity of soil-and sediment-dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of some functional groups . For instance , as Snelgrove et al . ( 2000 ) report , the roots of seagrasses can exclude burrowing organisms . Excessive disturbance to soil and sediment can also reduce below-surface structural heterogeneity and biodiversity . Organism interactions : Predators , herbivores , and symbionts directly connect functional groups or species across the soil or sediment surface . These interactions may increase , decrease , or result in no change in biodiversity across the surface . Hooper et al . ( 2000 ) note that in terrestrial domains , predation can reduce the abundance of dominant animal species across the interface , allowing subordinate species to flourish . Snelgrove et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that in marine domains , predation may reduce species biodiversity by eliminating slow-growing and rare species but note that exclusion experiments in some communities have shown predator and prey communities across the marine sediment surface to operate relatively independently . Cross-surface migration : Many organisms within soils and sediments migrate across the soil or sediment surface , at short time scales from minutes to hours ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their life cycle ( e.g. , larvae of many terrestrial insects reside in soils or freshwater sediments while their adult , reproductive phases live above-surface ; conversely , larvae of bivalves and hydrozoans occupy the water column while their adult form settles on the sediments ) . At each side of the interface , they will influence biodiversity directly by their presence and indirectly by their interactions with other organisms . Snelgrove et al . ( 2000 ) and Palmer et al . ( 2000 ) emphasized the importance of these migrations in linking biodiversity above and below the surface of sediments . <p> These four mechanisms will involve direct biotic interactions among organisms across the surface interface , or indirect biotic or abiotic stages ( Palmer et al . 2000 ) operate at various degrees of specificity , defined by Hooper et al . ( 2000 ) as one-to-one ( 1:1 ) species linkages ( e.g. , specific mutualism , parasitism , and predation , or supply of key resource by one species to another ) ; one-to-many species linkages ( e.g. , when one species or functional group supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; or many-to-many linkages ( e.g. , where high diversity at one side of the surface supplies diverse resources that promote high diversity at the other side ) operate to increase , decrease , or have no effect on biodiversity across the soil or sediment surface <p> Specific examples of how particular species , functional groups , or communities on one side of the soil or sediment surface influence those on the other through these mechanisms are provided in the first three papers in this issue . They yield many more examples of connections from above-surface to below-surface biota than vice versa , probably reflecting our biased knowledge of , and research focus on , mechanisms that originate above the surface . Most studies cited were of interactions in which the presence of a particular species or functional group provides a resource that can support a suite of organisms across the surface ( one-to-many interactions ) . Less was known about the extent to which biodiversity above and below the surface is linked by species-specific couplings ( 1:1 interactions ) , or whether high species diversity on one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many-to-many interactions ) . <p> Important differences in the processes connecting biota above and below the surface of soils and sediments within and across domains were also revealed . For example , in shallow vegetated aquatic habitats , biota above and below the sediment surface are coupled through inputs of complex organic matter , structural effects of macrophytes on sediments , and refuge from predation offered by the canopy . However , in deeper nonvegetated aquatic habitats , these effects are absent . In marine and freshwater habitats , filter-feeding bivalves living both in and on the sediment can exert strong effects on biota in the water column , altering their abundance and composition , stripping phytoplankton from the water column , and shifting the entire nutrient status and functioning of the ecosystem . Filter feeders , or an analogous functional group , are absent from soils . <p> Across the three domains , there were also considerable differences in the spatial and temporal scales at which the cross-surface linkages operate . Above-surface and below-surface biota may be most tightly coupled in terrestrial ecosystems , where exchange of nutrients and particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aquatic domains . In freshwater ecosystems , sediment biota are routinely affected by nutrients and particles from organisms in distant parts of the watershed or upstream ( Wagener et al . 1998 , Palmer et al . 2000 ) . In the open ocean , above-surface and below-surface systems are essentially decoupled , with virtually no production near the sediment and very slow and dispersed exchange of nutrients and particles across the sediment-water interface . Furthermore , in the deep sea , very few predators span the entire water column from surface to sediments , and most remain close to the sediments ( Snelgrove et al . 2000 ) . For oceans , information on above- to below-sediment linkages declines with depth , probably reflecting both fewer linkages and our poor knowledge of these inaccessible habitats . Impact of global change on connections between above- and below-surface biodiversity <p> Recent syntheses have predicted large effects of global change on biodiversity ( Sala et al . 2000 ) , but they primarily considered biodiversity above the surface of soils and sediments . In this issue , Wolters et al . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Smith et al . ( 2000 ) predict that climate change , land use change ( including change in use of aquatic habitats ) , atmospheric change , and biotic exchange ( primarily introduction of invasive species ) will exert large direct and indirect ( resulting from physiological and ecological connections to the altered above-surface biodiversity ) effects on biodiversity in both soils and freshwater and marine sediments ( Box 3 ) . Across the domains , there are some similarities and some differences in the mechanisms by which the global change drivers may exert their effects . <p> Climate change . Below-surface biodiversity will be influenced by direct abiotic effects of climate change on soils and sediments , including alterations in temperature , wet-dry and freeze-thaw regimes , precipitation , terrestrial runoff , ocean circulation patterns , and sea-level rise . Across all domains , altered abundance , composition , and distribution of above-surface communities with climate change was predicted to have large effects on below-surface communities by altering timing and amount of organic inputs to below-surface decomposer food webs and by disrupting species-specific symbiotic interactions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrations may affect the abundance and composition of soil and freshwater sediment decomposer communities by inducing altered physiology of plants and composition of plant communities and thus altering organic inputs . Elevated CO2 was not predicted to have large effects on marine sediment biodiversity . Atmospheric nitrogen deposition contributes to acidification of soils and freshwater sediments , reducing the abundance and diversity of their biota through direct toxic effects or interactions with altered above-surface biota . The effects of atmospheric inputs on soil and sediment biodiversity can be magnified through interactions with other global change drivers . For example , atmospheric nitrogen deposition contributes to nonpoint source nitrogen pollution and eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems , which can dramatically alter sediment community composition and reduce biodiversity . <p> Land use change . Across all domains , land use change will affect soil and sediment biodiversity through habitat loss , increased disturbance , chemical inputs , and interactions with altered above-surface biota . Conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture affects soil and freshwater sediment biodiversity through all of these mechanisms . Freshwater sedimentary habitat and biodiversity is dramatically reduced by appropriation of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biodiversity through disturbance and removal of key predators , and aquaculture increases chemical inputs . <p> Biotic exchange . Invasive species can influence soil and sediment biota directly though interactions such as predation and competition or indirectly by altering resource inputs and physical habitat . Across all domains , there was evidence that invasive species have already dramatically altered the trophic structure of some ecosystems and reduced the biodiversity in their soils and sediments . Predicting the impacts of invasive species at local scales is complex , however , and they may increase or decrease species richness . Nonetheless , invasions clearly displace native species and thus , at landscape scales , pose a great threat to diversity by homogenizing the Earth 's biota . <p> The articles in this issue yield more examples of how the effects of global change on above-surface biota will feed back to influence below-surface biota than vice versa . This is largely because global changes are enacted primarily above the surface , and below-surface communities are somewhat protected from their direct effects . The discrepancy may also reflect our much greater knowledge of global change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In general , Lake et al . ( 2000 ) , Smith et al . ( 2000 ) , and Wolters et al . ( 2000 ) predict that global change will weaken connections between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity , decoupling current associations between species and functional groups on either side of the surface . In particular , each driver of global change has great potential to alter the transfer of chemical resources from above-surface to below-surface habitats . Altered abundance , composition , and distribution of above-surface communities will change timing and amount of organic inputs for decomposition , which may decouple linkages to below-surface detritivores . Each global change driver also has great potential to disrupt specific cross-surface interactions such as predation , mutualism , or parasitism by reducing abundance or competitiveness of , or eliminating , the above-surface component from the ecosystem . In the short term ( tens to hundreds of years ) , we predict , the decoupling of current cross-surface biotic assemblages will reduce above-surface and below-surface biodiversity at patch to landscape scales . However , in the long term , new species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in more detail in this special issue , indicate that in terrestrial , freshwater , and marine ecosystems , the same four primary mechanisms are important for connecting biota above and below the surface of soils and sediments . They also present evidence that connections between functional groups across the soil and sediment surface can be highly specific , and the presence of a particular functional group on one side of the surface can depend on that of another across the surface . The lack of species-level data from soils and sediments prevents generalizations about the species specificity of interactions across the surface . Some highly species-specific interactions are noted , such as parasitism of plants by nematode species ( Hooper et al . 2000 ) and the requirement of some freshwater bivalve species for particular fish species as hosts ( Palmer et al . 2000 ) . However , the species specificity of symbiotic associations can vary greatly , and many mutualists , parasites , and predators have broad host ranges . <p> There was also evidence from all domains that a high species diversity of producers can increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chemical composition among plankton ) and promote high species diversity of consumers ( e.g. , detritivorous invertebrates or bacteria ) on the other side of the soil or sediment surface . However , in some instances , composition of producers rather than their diversity may determine resource heterogeneity . <p> The evidence for some species specificity in cross-surface interactions and for linkages between producer and consumer diversity suggests some degree of coupling between biological diversity above and below the surface of soils and sediments . However , we lack detailed information on which species are coupled and on the extent of this coupling . This limits our ability to : identify keystone species and ecosystem processes that cross the surface ; restore functioning communities ; and determine whether maps of biodiversity distributions and hotspots based on above-surface biodiversity hold true for the highly diverse below-surface biota , and are thus accurate assessments of overall biodiversity distribution . Research priorities to increase our understanding of the coupling between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity must include assessing the extent of species specificity in biological interactions between above-surface and below-surface organisms determining whether resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their chemical composition independent of species richness directly comparing species richness and distributions above and below the soil and sediment surface <p> Using knowledge of global change effects on above-surface biota and of ecological links between above-surface and below-surface biota , these articles predict that there will be widespread disruption to current species assemblages and reduced biodiversity both above and below the soil or sediment surface , in time scales relevant to today 's decisionmakers and managers . Despite the important implications of such changes for natural resources and ecosystem functioning , direct studies of global change effects on below-surface biodiversity are rare , especially for freshwater and marine sediments ; such studies must be a research priority . We urgently need more information on how altered above-surface and below-surface biodiversity will affect ecosystem functioning . As Wolters et al . ( 2000 ) describe , ecosystem processes that are distributed continuously across a broad suite of organisms may persist if species are lost . However , ecosystem traits that are discontinuously distributed among a few species will be very sensitive to species loss . A challenge for the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate vital ecosystem functions the vulnerability to global change of the species or functional groups involved in these interactions the sensitivity of the ecosystem function to any changes in species or functional group composition and richness <p> This synthesis highlights the fact that soils and sediments are a dynamic habitat , connecting the ecology , physiology , and biological diversity of above-surface and below-surface domains . Understanding the composition and functioning of ecosystems and their response to global change will require that these linkages be routinely considered , because no domain exists in isolation ; indeed , large portions of the Earth are an interface between domains . Box 1 . Mechanisms that may promote or limit correlations between above-surface and below-surface biodiversity <p> Promoting factors Above-surface and below-surface species or functional groups show similar ( possibly independent ) responses to environmental gradients are influenced by similar historical , biogeographic , and evolutionary factors are connected by physiological and ecological interactions that promote biodiversity across the surface Limiting factors <p> Above-surface and below-surface species or functional groups respond to different environmental gradients respond to environmental conditions at different spatial and temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different historical , biogeographic , and evolutionary factors may be regulated by trophic dynamics at the same side of the soil or sediment surface , rather than from the other side are sampled by different methods that examine biodiversity at different scales are connected by physiological and ecological interactions that reduce biodiversity at the other side of the soil or sediment surface may be regulated by factors that depend on composition of resources from across the surface independent of taxonomic diversity Box 2 : Evidence for and against correlations between biodiversity patterns above and below the surface of soils and sediments For Diversity of several marine pelagic animals ( Angel 1997 ) and sedimentary bivalves , gastropods , and isopods ( Rex et al . 1993 ) generally show similar trends with latitude ( decreasing with increasing latitude ) and depth ( greatest at intermediate depths ) , based on minimal data . Disturbance from land use change decreases species richness and abundance for plants and soil-dwelling termites ( Eggleton et al . 1997 ) and nematodes ( Freckman and Ettema 1993 , Wasilewska 1997 ) . Forest floristic and mollusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mayhill 1999 ) . Against Deep-sea sediment nematode biodiversity patterns do not conform to the latitudinal patterns for pelagic and other marine sediment taxa described above ( Lambshead et al . 2000 ) . Plant diversity increases toward the equator , but diversity within some soil taxonomic groups does not-e.g. , earthworms ( Brussaard et al . 1997 , Lavelle et al . 1995 ) , nematodes ( Boag and Yeates 1998 ) , and mycorrhizae ( Allen et al . 1995 ) . At the continental scale , richness of termite genera corresponds more closely to net primary productivity than to tree diversity ( Eggleton 2000 ) . At the plot scale , Amazonian soil macrofauna diversity was positively correlated with plant biomass but not with diversity ( Barros 1999 ) .

##4000667 Ravelstein , by Saul Bellow , Viking . <p> IN Diana Trilling 's memoir The Beginning of the Journey she tells a story about Saul Bellow to illustrate the effect that Lionel Trilling had on people . Lionel , she writes , <p> always retained a certain air of unassailability . There were people whom this seemed to disturb . In middle life , he lectured at the University of Chicago , and Saul Bellow , who taught there and with whom he had become pleasantly acquainted in the early fifties when Bellow was writing The Adventures of Augie March , invited him to have a drink after his talk . For their drinking place Bellow chose a bar in a desperate quarter of the city ; it was the gathering place of drunks and deadbeats , a refuge of people who had been irreparably damaged by life . What other explanation of Bellow 's choice could there be than the wish to test Lionel 's ability to handle himself in such surroundings ? <p> We may know what she means , we may be able to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicity in this description is , as it were , part of the problem . And it is a problem that Saul Bellow has been unusually alert to in his fiction . It is the problem of culture , and particularly so-called high culture , as a version of pastoral ; but a version of pastoral that can be made to look unassailable because of the apparent complexity and subtlety and depth of its inclusions . A strangely modern version of pastoral , because it persuades us to forget that pastoral is what it is . At its worst it is a refuge masquerading as a profound engagement . If despite Diana Trilling 's rhetorical question this scene seems emblematic in more ways than one -- of two antagonistic Jewish ( and not only Jewish ) aspirations , of the composure of the cultured versus the disarray of what they hide from , of the need to know people by testing them rather than by taking them on their own terms -- it is partly because it stages so neatly the preoccupations , the obsessions , of both Trilling and Bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravelstein of Bellow 's title is no exception -- are always wholeheartedly assailable , and above all attentive to other people 's airs ( and often their graces ) . And they are always men who live somewhere in themselves , in a desperate quarter ; and are , as everyone is , irreparably damaged by life . But unlike almost everyone else , they are astonishingly articulate , and learned , and poignantly moving and amused about their various predicaments . However abject , they luxuriate in words and things ( Humboldt , Bellow wrote , " spoke wonderfully of the wonderful , abominable rich " ) . Ravelstein , the great teacher dying of AIDS , is in this tradition of Bellow 's grandly destitute , and is at the center of what is , remarkably , one of Bellow 's finest novels . <p> Trilling is always trying to persuade us ( and presumably himself ) in his criticism that the culture he values is n't , and should n't be , a retreat from anything . And Bellow 's fiction , one way or another , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of culture and learning . For Bellow the drama has n't been only about connecting the prose and the passion , but more about seeing what the deadbeats and the professors make of each other . As both of them are sticklers for the noble life -- and are keen to tell us what we should be doing to ennoble our lives -- they are determinedly stylish about the crude and the vulgar ( in this sense Trilling 's composure and the brash eloquence of Bellow 's heroes are mirror images of each other ) . They are , in their quite different ways , both enthralled by , and at their most fascinating about , sophistication . <p> Writing in Sincerity and Authenticity about how the novelists of the nineteenth century were " anything but confident that the old vision of the noble life could be realized , " Trilling refers to Bellow 's Moses Herzog . " When , for example , " Trilling writes , <p> a gifted novelist , Saul Bellow , tries through his Moses Herzog to question the prevailing negation of the old vision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we respond with discomfort and embarrassment . And the more , no doubt , because we discern some discomfort and embarrassment on the part of Mr. Bellow himself , arising from his sufficiently accurate apprehension that in controverting the accepted attitude he lays himself open to the terrible charge of philistinism , of being a defector from the ranks of the children of light , a traitor to spirit . We take it as an affront to our sense of reality that a contemporary should employ that mode of judging the spiritual life which we are willing to accept and even find entrancing when we encounter it in Shakespeare 's romances . <p> As terrible charges go , one might think , there are probably worse ones . And yet , as ever , Trilling has located , in his elegant , Freudian way , a conflict . Or at least some kind of paradoxical tension in Bellow 's work . If it is old-fashioned , if not actually regressive , to assert the value of the achieved and successful life , what else can be asserted in its stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phrase Allan Bloom , the putative original for Ravelstein , uses with reference to Shakespeare 's romances -- of these romances affront our contemporary sense of reality , then what forms of disarray are we going to put our money on ? <p> Ravelstein , the political philosopher and worshipper of Eros , has devoted his life to teaching the best that has been thought and done about the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the polis ; and he is now dying of AIDS . And he has asked his older close friend , a writer called Chick , to write his biography , the final testament to an achieved and successful life . Or rather , the contemporary genre in which the notions of success and achievement are both assumed and put into question . More than any of Bellow 's other books , Ravelstein seems like a wholly successful example of an utterly implausible genre : a contemporary , Jewish Platonic dialogue . Like the tricky romance of taking Trilling to that bar -- wondering whether it would end in tears , or just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this novel to explore the ways in which people are informed , in the most various senses of this word , by the people they love and admire . It is " the promise Chick had made years ago to write a short description of Ravelstein and to give an account of his life . " And as a kept promise of sorts -- the book we read is an account of preparing to write this biography -- it is an ironic vindication , against the grain of modern biography , that a short description of somebody , done with sufficient skill , can be an account of their life . Bellow intimates not ( quite ) that all biographers are failed novelists , but that all biographies are failed or ersatz novels . <p> The novel Ravelstein is , in other words , not a biography of someone called Ravelstein , nor of someone called Allan Bloom . It is a fiction about biography . And the much publicized connections made between Bellow 's close friend Bloom and Bellow 's ( and Chick 's ) subject Ravelstein are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , integral to Bellow 's sense of , or joke about , biography in this book . Ravelstein , we are told on several occasions , loved listening to classical music played on " original instruments " : and what , we are made to wonder in a book about someone who wonders about virtually everything , does " original " mean ? What is involved in this fantasy of origins ? If Ravelstein is " like " Allan Bloom or " based on " Allan Bloom , he is also , unsurprisingly , like Moses Herzog , like Humboldt . And they are all , in their way , originals : original instruments , original voices . <p> It is one of Ravelstein 's projects to divorce his students -- who are always his devoted proteges -- from what used to be called their backgrounds . " He hated his own family and never tired of weaning his gifted students from their families . His students , as I 've said , had to be cured of the disastrous misconceptions , the ' standardized unrealities ' imposed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and originality are at odds with each other ; he persuades his students to disown , as he has done , their supposed histories . But even though Ravelstein is , by definition , no Freudian -- and , as a committed European , no Emersonian either ( although Thoreau , as we shall see , puts in some interesting appearances ) -- his biographer-to-be , Chick , as he is aptly named , has a more familiar , literary-Freudian cast of mind . So he reads Ravelstein in a way Ravelstein would never read himself ; that is , through a particular canon of literary allusions . " His lot , his crew , his disciples , his clones who dressed as he did , smoked the same Marlboros , and found in these entertainments a common ground between the fan clubs of childhood and the Promised Land of the intellect towards which Ravelstein , their Moses and their Socrates , led them . " Bellow has always been able to pack a sentence ; and at its worst this can give his writing a kind of studied fluency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But here , as everywhere in Ravelstein , there is no straining for effect in writing about a character who is , for all intents and purposes , doing virtually nothing but that . " Crew " refers us to Milton 's Satan , and " disciples " refers us to Satan 's rival ; " the Promised Land of the intellect " seems to marry Jerusalem and Athens . Ravelstein , we are told , was " Homeric , " a lover of Plato ; a Jew who devoted his life to Athens until he began dying , when he turned back to his forefathers . Chick , though , is not the kind of person who thinks along Jerusalem and Athens lines . If he is anything , in this debate that Bellow has so shrewdly staged , he is literary rather than political . And Bellow , of course , is mindful of what is at stake in such distinctions . <p> There is , in Ravelstein 's view , something childish about the way the literary tend , as it were , to overpersonalize things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often at pains to conceal : that writing about someone turns too easily into writing on their behalf . That biographers can be sly when they use their nominal subjects as novelists use their characters , as a way of saying something . Ravelstein is Chick 's opportunity to voice his misgivings about the literary life , and the literary life story . <p> But Ravelstein might have argued that there was a danger of self-indulgence in it . Either you continue to live in epiphanies or you shake them off and take up trades and tasks , you adopt rational principles and concern yourself with society and politics . Then the sense of coming from " elsewhere " vanishes . In my case Ravelstein 's opinion was that distinctiveness of observation had gone much further than it should and was being cultivated for its own strange sake . Mankind had first claim on our attention and I indulged my " personal metaphysics " too much , he thought . <p> As " Ravelstein might have argued ... " ends up as " he thought , " Bellow conveys just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own in our words ; that we are always speaking and writing from other people 's points of view , on their behalf . And often speaking in their voices back to them . That we might be full of other people -- engaged in endless mutual biography -- makes a more private sense of self difficult to account for . For Chick the privacy of the self is the self : " my feeling was that you could n't be known thoroughly unless you found a way to communicate certain ' incommunicables ' -- your private metaphysics . " For Chick 's Ravelstein , private metaphysics , " intimate metaphysics , " is the pastime of people intimidated by the publicness of public life . " A man , " Ravelstein believed , " should be able to hear , and to bear , the worst that could be said of him . " Being assailable is the point and not the problem . You make yourself out of what the world makes of you , and what you can make it make of you . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a willingness to let the self-esteem structure be attacked and burned to the ground was a measure of your seriousness . " In other words , for Chick 's Ravelstein shame is a protection racket . <p> So , much play is made in this novel by Ravelstein and Chick and Bellow of Chick 's New England retreat in the country . In his " fieldstone house " with its " old maples and hickory trees " Chick hears very little about what other people think of him . But he has to bear what Ravelstein thinks and that , in a sense , is what Ravelstein is there for . And why , by the same token , Ravelstein has chosen Chick as his biographer . Chick always wants to hear what Ravelstein has to say , and he enjoys bearing it . Ravelstein , who is bored by the country , comes to see Chick out of curiosity ; not curiosity about the country , but curiosity about Chick 's pleasure in it . " He had come to the country to see me , and the visit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did I want to bury myself in the woods ? " For Ravelstein this is quite literally a kind of death-in-life ; and the preoccupation with death , the worry about it , he considers definitely " bourgeoisie . " The " great-souled " live in the knowledge of death , but they do n't distract themselves with the terrors or the attractions of it . So for him , " the drama of the season lacked real interest . Not to be compared to the human drama ... to lose yourself in grasses , leaves , winds , birds , or beasts was an evasion of higher duties . " Thoreau 's " woods " that keep turning up in this book -- " I was not out of the woods , " Chick remarks as he begins to recover from his own near-fatal illness towards the end of the book -- are for Ravelstein a false solution to the problem of politics , to hearing and bearing what other people say about us ; and how this informs what we can hear and say and think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive , and to be alive is to be in circulation . And once we are around other people our composure is on the line . " To lose your head , " Ravelstein believed , " was the great-souled thing to do . " It is only with other people that the great temptations of discretion and indiscretion are available . <p> And yet if Ravelstein were more of an allegory than it is -- and occasionally it seems like more of an allegory than it is -- there would be a simple schema at its heart . There is the solitude of Walden , and Ravelstein dying of AIDS : AIDS as the worst consequence of a certain kind of free association ; private intimate metaphysics -- burying oneself alive and working out how to get out and how not to -- as the worst ( or best ) consequence of withdrawal . Ravelstein , believing what he believes , and dying in the way he is dying -- " a serious person , not comfortable with himself , " as Chick says with Bellow 's infallible ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once an ultimate form of contemporary nobility , and a test of his fastidiousness as a writer . Ravelstein 's " tact " about his own homosexuality , and his contempt for certain contemporary manners -- " He despised campy homosexuality and took a very low view of ' gay pride ' " -- is matched by Chick 's curious blandness about the whole subject . And both Ravelstein and Chick conspire in Bellow 's familiar idealization of a certain kind of woman ( what analysts refer to as the wished-for mother of infancy -- Chick 's young wife , Rosamund , for example , is someone with whom " there was no subject raised which she did n't immediately understand " ) . In writing about Ravelstein 's homosexuality , Bellow takes the Greek tragedy approach : the terrible things happen offstage . <p> We are led to believe that Ravelstein has got up to all sorts of unmentionable things , but the main relationship in the book , with a much younger man called Nikki , is rather more of the loving and caring sort . Nikki is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strongly drawn and , as usual with Bellow , remarkably vivid in his brief appearances , there is overall something overstylized about what we are allowed to see of Ravelstein 's more passionately fraught life . This is particularly striking given how often Chick refers to and reiterates Ravelstein 's devotion to the god Eros , to a virtual religion of longing and desire . You get the feeling that Chick ( and perhaps Bellow ) have Platonized Ravelstein 's homosexuality rather more than Ravelstein would always have wished . It is not that there is n't enough fist fucking in the novel , but that there 's a great deal of theorizing about the shady concealments people live by , and with : a too refined distrust of refinement . A gay bar , you imagine , would be a bar that Chick would not be keen to go to . <p> In generational terms Ravelstein 's age would have made a certain kind of discretion the order of the day . And yet Bellow 's sense of propriety , which is invariably accurate , serves another purpose here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love between men -- and especially the hero-worshiping kind -- and the love between the generations . And yet it is one of the curious effects of his fiction to make it virtually unthinkable that two men could actually desire each other rather than , or as well as , admire or look after each other . In Bellow 's fictional world homosexuality is not so much invisible as implausible . And this again is where the putative connection between Ravelstein and Allan Bloom is also a cover story . Whatever Bloom 's attitude was toward homosexuality , or indeed to his dying of AIDS , Bellow is still making his own decisions as a novelist about Ravelstein . And he keeps reminding us , throughout the novel , that biographies are rather like novels , and that this book , Ravelstein , is not a biography , but a story about a man who wants to write one . " I am bound , " Chick tells us , " as an honest observer to make plain how Ravelstein operates " ; and he is referring both to the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book , also called Ravelstein , operates . What Chick calls Ravelstein 's " endlessly diverting character " is never observed operating sexually , so to speak ; what is observed -- and Bellow writes with astounding tenderness about Ravelstein 's ill body -- are the terrible results of Ravelstein 's secret ( at least to Chick ) erotic life . Ravelstein may be diverting , but Chick is diverting us . <p> The complications that homosexuality throws Ravelstein into -- both the character , and the book itself -- are pertinent because Ravelstein is a novel peculiarly troubled by evasiveness . As a fictional character , Ravelstein , like many of Bellow 's heroes , is someone forever exercised and energized by other people 's concealments and duplicities . Bellow 's heroes unmask their fellow men and women by force of character , through a kind of demonic intuition . They are never programmatically suspicious -- they are never Freudians or Marxists -- they have , rather like novelists , idiosyncratic powers of divination . So Ravelstein is often getting Chick to face various facts -- a key word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he idealizes the naivete of Eros , the primal intelligence of longing , while exposing the pernicious naivete of everyday life . Chick , for example , fails to spot the fascists among his acquaintances , refuses to see that his wife has put a hex on him , and so on . Ravelstein is an expert on moral cowardice . " Why does the century , " he asks , " ... underwrite so much destruction ? There is a lameness that comes over all of us when we consider these facts . " It is part of Ravelstein 's " teaching-vaudeville " to assail and assault Chick with the plain facts of the time : the fact , say , that Jews have to live with the knowledge that quite recently a significant number of powerful people wanted to wipe them out entirely , and nearly succeeded . And yet the great glaring facts , the " world-historical ringside seats " that these Bellow heroes promote with such amazing eloquence , keep running up against the centering image of the book , Ravelstein 's increasingly dying body . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward moment , " destroyed by his reckless sex habits . " We should n't evade the big questions , but we should n't use the big questions to evade the other questions . Bellow has always had a truth-comes-in-blows sensibility , but in Ravelstein there is a new uncertainty about which blows matter and why . And a strong sense that there is a difference between talking , however grandly and wildly and wisely , about recklessness , and living recklessly . <p> If Ravelstein turned out to be his last novel , it would be an extraordinary valediction . But we should hope that it is n't because Bellow is beginning to say new -- and to use one of his words -- serious things about , among many other things , evasion and recklessness . Evasion is not news , but our evasion of recklessness is . <p> By Adam Phillips <p> 
##4000672 Of No Country 1 Know : New and Selected Poems and Translations , by David Ferry , University of Chicago Press . <p> The Eclogues of Virgil : A Translation , by David Ferry , Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . Naive and Sentimental Cowboys <p> WALT WHITMAN in conversation , circa 1890 : " You know Eakins ? the painter : he was sick , run down , out of sorts : he went right among the cowboys : herded : built up miraculously ... he needed the converting , confirming , uncompromising touch of the plains . " <p> In 1886 , the year he painted Whitman 's portrait , Thomas Eakins was fired from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for allowing his students to model for each other in the nude , boys as naked as girls . His Western journey , begun in late July of 1887 , was meant to clear the nastiness of the so-called " loincloth incident " from his spirit . He headed for the Badlands , where Theodore Roosevelt had found strenuous sustenance a few months earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future paintings . Dogs , guns , horses , saddles , broad-brimmed hats , cowboys -- these were the subjects his camera found . <p> They were found in turn by David Ferry , in the fourth of a series inspired by Eakins called " Photographs from a Book : Six Poems , " first published in Strangers : A Book of Poems ( 1983 ) and now republished in Of No Country I Know . The first two triplets of five : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Look up this picture in Gordon Hendricks 's The Photographs of Thomas Eakins ( 1972 ) , and you 'll see that Ferry has taken liberties in his ekphrasis , as his endnote carefully , almost legalistically , concedes : " Several of the photographs evoked in the poems are related to photographs reproduced in ... Hendricks . " In his poem , Ferry has conflated two of Hendricks 's captions : Plate 134 is " Cowboy in Dakota Territory , " while the following picture , another cowboy , is captioned " Unidentified man in Dakota Territory . " It is possible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badger Company Ranch -- more likely it was shot near the B-T Ranch , Eakins 's tamer-sounding base in the Badlands . In short , Ferry has invented an ideal Eakins photograph , and an ideal cowboy , " a hero/Who has read nothing at all about heroes . " <p> Ferry 's poem is a sort of free translation of the Eakins photograph , and what he 's after is a certain state of mind and of language . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Ferry defines the cowboy 's perspective negatively , with his sequence of four prominently placed " withouts " : " without/The amazement of self ... without mercy ... without the imagination that he is/Without mercy . " Friedrieh Schiller , in one of the defining distinctions of the romantic movement , named this untrammeled condition of mind and of art the " naive , " which he associated with the poets Homer , Aeschylus , Shakespeare , and Goethe . In Schiller 's view , these poets had direct access to nature -- indeed , they were nature . Unreflecting , confident , realistic -- they wrote what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the writers Kleist and Klopstock , in the opposing camp of the " sentimental " poets . Tending towards elegy , the sentimental poets have lost touch with nature , and have as their dubious reward a sense of higher , more " ideal " things . ( Among American poets , Whitman is naive , Dickinson sentimental . ) " They touch us by ideas , not by sensuous truth ; not so much because they are nature as because they are able to inspire enthusiasm in us for nature . " <p> With a final " without , " Ferry associates the naive point of view with the camera , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In his deadpan phrasing ( " Plate 134 . By Eakins . ' A cowboy in the West ' " ) and in his accumulation of realistic detail ( " His hat , his gun , his gloves " ) , Ferry tries to adopt the naive point of view of the camera . But the project is doomed , and in the tension between naive and sentimental lies the life of the poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant enjambed triplets rather than Whitman 's cascading catalogs -- and in its diction . The cowboy may not know what is " to the East of him , " but Ferry does , just as he knows all about heroes and mercy and the amazement of self . And all this awareness , which Schiller , with no derogation , would call sentimental , comes together in the " Heartbreaking canteen . " The only heart that can be broken here is Ferry 's , for we know -- since Ferry has convinced us -- that the cowboy 's heart is invulnerable . <p> There is no canteen in Eakins 's photograph . Where you 'd expect to find it , on the broken , sun-bleached ground , there 's a reclining dog peering out sleepily at the camera . The cowboy himself , to my eye , looks more self-conscious and pleased with himself , in every way more " sentimental , " than Ferry wants him to be . Clearly visible on the cowboy 's hip , in a picture in which many other things are n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rather foppish chaps . ( Eakins reveals in a letter that he had his cowboy shave before he photographed him . ) The cowboy 's cool stare recalls James Dean in the familiar photographs from his ranch in Indiana . Eakins is evoking an idea of the cowboy as dandy . <p> Ferry 's is a strong misreading ; he wants his cowboys to be " uncompromising " like Whitman 's , and the evidence to the contrary breaks his heart . We can see the same split in Stephen Crane , a writer that the art historian Michael Fried has compared to Eakins . " Damn the east ! " Crane wrote in the fall of 1895 , before setting off for Nebraska . " I fell in love with the straight out-and-out , sometimes-hideous , often-braggart westerners because I thought them to be the truer men .... They are serious , those fellows . When they are born they take one big gulp of wind and then they live . " Crane fell in love with naive cowboys , but put sentimental ones in his stories . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes to Yellow Sky " is Eakins 's cowboy as dandy : <p> A man in a maroon-colored flannel shirt , which had been purchased for purposes of decoration and made , principally , by some Jewish women on the east side of New York , rounded a corner and walked into the middle of the main street of Yellow Sky . In either hand the man held a long , heavy blue-black revolver .... And his boots had red tops with gilded imprints , of the kind beloved in winter by little sledding boys on the hillsides of New England . Hairy and Shaggy Horses <p> David Ferry was born in Orange , New Jersey , in 1924 , a few miles from where Crane , another Jersey man , is buried . I know there are readers who have followed Ferry 's career all along the way , from the poems collected in On the Way to the Island ( 1960 ) and Strangers : A Book of Poems ( 1983 ) on to the late flowering of his work during the past decade . But for many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic ( a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award in poetry in 1993 ) , then of Horace 's odes , and most recently of Virgil 's eclogues . Concurrently , he published a terrific book of poems and translations called Dwelling Places ( 1993 ) . This late cluster of books has in common an abiding concern with a single theme , the same question that was bothering Schiller two centuries ago . In poem after poem , translation after translation , Ferry asks : What have we given up in relinquishing our intimacy with the natural world , with our ever diminishing inheritance of " wildness " ? Even in the supposedly classical poems of Horace and Virgil , Ferry is attuned to moments of vulnerability and second-guessing . His Rome is not the braggart Empire of Lowell 's Vietnam-era Near the Ocean , but a nervous realm of partying citizens and unsettled farmers ( Eclogue 9 : " A stranger came/To take possession of our farm , and said : /I own this place ; you have to leave this place " ) . <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to look -- at wildflowers , Schiller wondered , or at streams and mossy stones , birds and animals , children at play ? It ca n't just be their beauty of form , Schiller maintained , but must be a satisfaction " not aesthetic but moral . " We love in them " the tacitly creative life , the serene spontaneity of their activity , existence in accordance with their own laws . " And Schiller concluded , in an italicized sentence , " They are what we were ; they are what we should once again become . " When I read the first stanza of Ferry 's wonderful " When We Were Children , " a translation of a late thirteenth-century lyric PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> -- I think of Schiller 's devastating remark : " Our childhood is the only undisfigured nature that we still encounter in civilized mankind , hence it is no wonder if every trace of the nature outside us leads us back to our childhood . " <p> Or consider Ferry 's horses , in a translation of Jorge Guillen 's " Unos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Eakins 's cowboy , the " naive " perspective of the horses is defined by an accumulation of negatives : " Motionless ... untroubled ... Silently ... before the beginning of anything human ... unyokes ... show no sign/of understanding ... Know nothing ... obliviousness . " <p> Many readers will recognize this poem of Guillen 's from an earlier translation by Richard Wilbur , of which I will quote only the first quatrain for contrast : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> I know nothing much about the biographies of these two poets , Ferry and Wilbur , except that they are roughly the same age -- their late sew enties -- and attended Amherst College , the Amherst of Frost and Brower , during the 1940s . What I have to say has nothing to do with how or whether their lives have overlapped and everything to do with the lapping of their language , in these dueling versions . You ca n't take a stab at Guillen 's horses without knowing that Wilbur has been there before , circa 1960 , and staked out the territory pretty firmly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horses are radically constrained in their " barbed enclosure , " weighed down by their shagginess , their " thick and cumbrous manes . " Even their inactivity weighs on them ; they are , in the second quatrain , " Doomed to be idle , /To haul no cart or wagon , wear no bridle . " They " fatten like the grass . " Their compensation for their imprisonment is Keatsian soul-building : " Soul is the issue of so strict a fate. /They harbor visions in their waking eyes , /And with their quiet ears participate/In heaven 's pure serenity . " Like many sonnets , this one , at least as Wilbur translates it , encodes its own definition : " Pent in a barbed enclosure which contains , /By way of compensation , grazing-land . " Another version of why nuns fret not . <p> When we turn back to Ferry 's version , it 's as though the horses have grazed a little longer , and cleared more of the ground . What a difference between their unyoked ease grazing in the field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven lines to Wilbur 's full-sonnet fourteen , Ferry 's version of Guillen is less a retranslation than a translation of a translation . The English of Wilbur is what Ferry does not write in . For Wilbur 's hammering rhymed and " pent " quatrains , Ferry substitutes rhymeless and loose pentameter couplets ( with Stevens , subject of Ferry 's Amherst thesis , again as liberating model ) . And Ferry 's language is striking in what it lets in : the colloquial " There are " ( an unimaginable opening for Wilbur ) and chiming " growing there " two lines later , picked up in the final " grazing there . " The loose , easygoing enjambments looping from couplet to couplet ( " Silently growing there in the light of the natural/Morning " ) are foreign to Wilbur 's form and meaning . Really , these are two different poems in just about every way that counts . One way to put the difference is this : Ferry 's horses , hairy and unyoked , retain their naturalness , their naivete . Wilbur 's shaggy prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven they dimly sense . <p> Enkidu is the wild man , hairy and unyoked . Call him naive . And call his occasionally shaggy companion Gilgamesh , who knows both civilization and the charms of wildness , sentimental . The selections from Gilgamesh included in Ferry 's Of No Country I Know concern the death of Enkidu , and Gilgamesh 's lamentations for his partner . Here we can see how , for Ferry as for Schiller , elegy emerges from this conflict of wild and tame : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Am I the only reader who hears in those dosing lines an echo of another famous elegy , Rilke 's familiar " Herbsttag , " translated by Ferry and included in Of No Country I Know : " Will write long letters ; wander unpeacefully , /In the late streets , while the leaves stray down " ? <p> The figure of the " wild man " is everywhere in Ferry 's recent work , though whether the wild man in his various European and American guises led Ferry to Enkidu or whether Enkidu led him to his feral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening epigram , " Strabo Reading Megasthenes , " to Dwelling Places : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> I love this epigram but ca n't quite say why . I 'm drawn to the arresting clash of " flowers blooming " and " faraway roasting meat , " to the fussy scholarly evocation ( " According to Megasthenes ... with which to eat " ) of a " natural " existence , and to the deft and barely noticeable rhyme of " eat " and " meat . " Stupid Questions <p> Ferry 's quest for the wild man 's guileless perspective , Enkidu 's point of view , has led him to build whole poems around innocent questions . Some of the grandest , most familiar poems in English -- " Ode on a Grecian Urn , " " Among Schoolchildren , " Elizabeth Bishop 's " Filling Station " -- use questions conspicuously . But Ferry 's ubiquitous questions , in early and late poems , are striking for their naivete , as in this early poem , " My Mother 's Dying " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> These are lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the questions every other line verge on the faux-naif , especially on rereading . I 've come to prefer the bolder patterning and thematizing of questions in Ferry 's great ( and to my mind pretty much definitive ) version of Baudelaire 's sonnet " The Blind People , " which begins : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The unmaking of the sonnet as Frost and Wilbur conceived it escalates here . The enjambments are even more vigorous than in the Guillen sonnet , really yanking the lines into a single snake of a poem . As with the casual use of " there " in Guillen 's horses , I 'm struck here by the boldly colloquial placement of prepositions : " they walk in this ridiculous fashion through " ; " a denial I walk through " ; " What are they looking up at the sky for ? " There 's an angry edge to the questions that speaks of experience rather than innocence . <p> Sometimes a whole poem of Ferry 's will circle around questions , implied rather than explicit , as in his recent and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph gives rise to the poem , this one a snapshot of a family outing in New Jersey in 1916 , " a picture taken years before I was born . " Ferry tugs a few secrets from the stance and expressions of the various figures grouped around a car : his aunt Sis Nellie 's " frustrated sexuality turned/Into malice abetted and invigorated/By the cultural verve and ignorance of the place " ; his grandmother 's bad teeth " As seen by the conformation of her mouth , /Smiling without opening the lips " ; his vulnerable infant sister . He 's intrigued by his father 's straw hat in this wintry scene , but puzzled most of all by his mother : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> One of Ferry 's Eakins poems , the sixth , is based on a photograph of another excursion into the Jersey countryside , with Eakins -- his bulging paunch reflected in the water -- and two other naked men ( like three of Whitman 's twenty-eight bathers grown up ) staring towards the camera . The ending is strikingly like that of " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river is hard to see//In the washy blankness of the light ; the sallow/Flat South Jersey landscape , treeless almost , /almost featureless , stretches vaguely beyond . " The cowboys , the horses , the blind , the wild men , the children -- all of them traffic in the blankness of the sky . And this blankness yields , in the end , to an ordinary afternoon in New Jersey . The family photograph , in which all the features are familiar , is stranger for Ferry , more ultimately foreign , than anything he found in Eakins . The concluding line provides the title for Ferry 's " new and selected poems " : " of no country I know . " It sums up , in its awkwardly confident uncertainty , all the quests and questionings , sentimental and naive , of his distinguished body of work . <p> By Christopher Benfey <p> 
##4000675 Darwin 's Worms , by Adam Phillips , Basic Books . <p> Darwin and Freud live in many of our reflective reveries , shape our assumptions , bear down on what we think of our origins or how we think of our wishes and worries . In schools across America the teaching of evolution has become a subject of fierce controversy ; every weekday afternoon Oprah and her television guests recite their psychopathology , even as the newspapers , through advice-giving columnists , have made our dreams , our moments of yearning , a fit subject for daily discussion . For Adam Phillips the result has been a decisive cultural shift that informs the way we think about the world and our prospects in it . " We can see Darwin and Freud , " he tells us , " as among the people involved in taking God out of the picture , leaving us with nothing between us and nature . " Such an observation is meant to remind us that past existentialist outcries of anxiety , fear , and sorrow were prompted not only by personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have become for so many of us a believable reality , buttressed by scientific observation : a biologist 's scrutiny of Brazilian jungles , and indeed , the attention he gave to his own native soil , to its worms which make all the difference , he learned , in how the grass grows ; and a physician 's surmises about the reasons his ailing , recumbent patients think and feel and dream as they do -- a one-time clinical office become a mirror to the minds of millions . <p> Phillips links Darwin to Freud as if they were brothers under a modern skin of skepticism with respect to the received religious and philosophical pieties of the nineteenth century and before . He calls them " naturalists -- great natural history writers , " but they were also powerfully engaging , suggestive essayists who favored a dramatic presentation of our long ago human struggle to survive and prevail ( Darwin ) , and of our everyday effort to keep our wits about us , to keep our mood and manner reasonably solid and equable , no matter what distractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deeds ) put in our way ( Freud ) . Both these observers of the human scene became not only analytical commentators , determined to pursue their speculative forays , but insistently persuasive rhetoricians whose say became a kind of secular gospel . Phillips frankly calls their work " scandalous , " by which he means their books " disfigured people 's cherished ideals , and so compelled people to revise their hopes for themselves . " He stresses the writer 's charm , the conceptualist 's infectious imagination evident in both Darwin and in Freud : they " made it very difficult for us not to use a certain kind of vocabulary when we refer to ourselves ; words like sexuality , competition , childhood , the past , became compulsory in our self-descriptions . " <p> The two were idiosyncratic seers , willing to go it alone , not lodged in the universities or in politics , where many get to address faithful followers . Their written ideas appealed to readers prepared to break with the past -- the religiously sanctioned versions of the distant past , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Darwin gave us a new past , one plagued by grasping yet vulnerable animals , among which he numbered emerging humankind . For him our life today is a climax of sorts -- all those accidents and incidents that became , over millennia , the fateful emergence of a particular species : we the heirs of random chance and favoring circumstance ( hardly the decisive biblical story of lordly creation , willfully executed for reasons no one can ever know , since God 's ways are not ours to know , never mind investigate ) . Freud gave us a no less mysterious earlier time , obscured by clouds of forgetfulness , ever hovering over us , blurring our memories . He attended closely our ways of talking , our stray musings , our surprising dreams , vivid and pointed enough to stay alive in a morning 's awareness . It was Freud 's distinct genius to figure out the expressive purpose of those daydreams and nightmares , to use them as narrative clues , to see their recurrence , their symbolic insistence , as a telling revelation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds shunted aside but granted continuing power -- a secret hold on our brain 's workings , so the world 's first psychoanalyst realized as he tried to comprehend fixations of attraction and fear : a mental life that simply wo n't let go of us , no matter the press of custom and law and , not least , biblical commandment . <p> " My father worried about his patients a lot , " Anna Freud once remarked , and then revealed a surprising candor less easy to acknowledge , because it broke ground with the cherished posture of the selflessly hard-working doctor : <p> He worried about what would happen to him , his reputation . I was one thing to treat greatly troubled patients ; it was another thing to explain their complaints and symptoms -- their ways of thinking and acting -- to everyone else , the so called " normal " people in Vienna and elsewhere . Some of his patients were written off , as it is put in English , but it did n't take long for him to be dismissed , ostracized ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , but I 'm not sure even his enthusiastic admirers back then or now , have realized how determined , how stubborn , he had to be -- maybe words like " brave " or " courageous " do apply here , because he became who he 's now known to be because he dared stand up for his ideas , and I 'd add , stand up to certain people . <p> There she stopped , even as she was promptly asked to be specific , to spell out the nature of the reproving opposition her father took on . A smile , as if she wanted her listener to know that her answer was unnecessary -- it had become part of history 's lesson . Finally , a brief , understated comment , wryly made : " In the universities , in the churches , what The Interpretation of Dreams , The Psychopathology of Everyday Life , had to say all fell on deaf ears . " <p> We know Adam Phillips as one of Freud 's eventual followers -- he is a distinguished psychoanalyst and essayist -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Darwin , literally in time , but also as an excited , believing reader . Now Phillips brings together these two intellectual giants , writes of them cogently and suggestively , summons his ready , clear-headed capacity for sharp comparison of ideas , for penetrating psychological interpretation , conveys to us more than we may have known about them , and , in so doing , echoes what Anna Freud was indirectly putting on the record : the challenge that psychoanalysis once presented to religious and secular authority , even as Darwin , to this day , stirs fear and resentment in certain American communities . Here were two thinkers who had to be battlers -- or else they 'd have hedged their writing , cut and trimmed it to suit the principalities and powers of their time . We meet sides of them , through Phillips , that others have been less inclined to emphasize : Darwin 's effort , late in life , to understand the manner in which worms spend their lives ensuring the productivity of his beloved England 's topsoil ; Freud 's worry , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naught at the hands of future biographers -- his worry , really , that he would never be given his due . <p> Darwin and Freud are , of course , credited with much today . They were ambitious intellectual leaders , anxious to survive the constraints of mere mortality ; they were dying to live and live -- to survive over the centuries through the faith others would put in their proposed hypotheses . Phillips comes at them as a knowing , appreciative ironist who wants to give us some pause , some new thought , a surprise or two that jolts us from the easy passivity of latter-day exaltation , which is a kind of burial call for past historical personages . He brings to life these two thinkers , brings them close to the modern-day reader -- enables us to comprehend the manner of their emergent eminence . The book 's very title awakens us , and soon enough we are amused , stirred by the Darwin who would turn from his adventurous storehouse of observed factuality and speculative historical reconstruction , enabled by those Brazilian forests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book 's title has it ( The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms , with Observations on Their Habits ) , a daily miracle takes place : the lowly worm ploughs the land , accomplishes so very much , while big-shot human beings , so much " higher " on their own scales of capability and performance , take no notice -- and thereby miss something of great importance to their own welfare . Phillips becomes properly , instructively elegiac as he salutes those worms which commanded Darwin 's late-in-life attention : " They were inadvertently generous ; not designed for altruism . Not intentionally collaborative ; but the way they straggled for survival had spin-offs for other parts of nature . " <p> In Darwin 's hands the worm becomes a benefactor : an instance that affirms the prophetically leveling claim of the preaching Jesus , who paid the price for such sweeping radicalism -- that " the last shall be first , and the first last . " We think of Darwin as a challenger of biblical platitudes , and so this book has him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied at Cambridge University , and surely the biologist who never missed a trick as he contemplated nature had good cause to enjoy its casual modesty , its sly turns of fate , as it asserted various possibilities , not the least of which Darwin , spellbound , had come to witness with awe -- a smart man nodding appreciatively at the dumb worm . The point , by implication , was that we mighty ones now and then might stop exalting ourselves by looking upward to heaven , as the place where miracles are granted us , and , instead , cast a glance downward and nearby , where inadvertent magic happens daily -- here heralded ( through the form of the worm as a mighty doer ) by an author who wants to bring us closer to the " reality " his profession 's founder kept espousing as important for us to heed . <p> No question , in that regard , Freud was ever the practical striver , anxious to doff his hat to Realpolitik . For others he claimed the necessity of an obliging deference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced them , and thereby molded our aims and misgivings , our loyalties and our aversions -- the " they " children keep mentioning , the burgher mothers , fathers who raise their voices , use their hands , make clear what has to be , and therefore what is . Still , even the practicality of perceived power , much embraced by readers and professional colleagues , as well as the young , can only go so far . In no time , an open-minded visitor can arrive , turn critically away from established viewpoints , report unfavorable news to others , who , however , even as declared admirers , can turn so very adverse . In a sense Freud knew in his bones that the more he became revered , the more tempting it would be for others to belittle him , mock him -- become challengers to his orthodoxy , even as he had taken on the powers-that-be of conventional psychiatry . <p> The Freud in Darwin 's Worms is the young conquistador ( so he once called himself ) already worried about his future biographers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinterpretations or their willful errors of judgment . The brilliant neuropsychiatrist who claimed to have learned the secrets of others , and who narrated them tellingly in his articles and books , might himself be inaccurately understood and described -- so he worried , as Phillips reminds us , to the point that the very art and act of biography became regarded as suspect by the one who had become so accomplished at figuring out the lives of others , and who , at the end of his life , wrote of Moses , no less , and of his monotheism . Like Darwin , Freud could look at religion with decided disfavor ( as in The Future of an Illusion ) , yet feel impelled to give it an almost awed attention , his Judaism a voice within him that very much wanted expression . So it went for these two shrewd and earthy iconoclasts , their scientific breakthroughs no bar , ultimately , to their spiritual memories , a legacy each would have to address by implication , notwithstanding the clear-headed rationality , the preoccupation with palpable reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By Robert Coles <p> 
##4000971 A few hours after the terrorist events in New York City , Washington , D.C. , and Pennsylvania , the Bush administration concluded without waiting for supporting evidence that " Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida organization were prime suspects . " George Tenet , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , stated that bin Laden has the capacity to plan " multiple attacks with little or no warning . " Secretary of State Colin Powell called the attacks " an act of war , " and President Bush confirmed in an evening televised address to the nation that he would " make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them . " Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at " state sponsorship , " implying the complicity of one or more foreign governments . And in the words of former National Security Adviser Lawrence Eagleburger , " I think we will show when we get attacked like this , we are terrible in our strength and in our retribution . " <p> Meanwhile , parroting official statements , Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed against civilian targets in the Middle East . In the words of William Saffire writing in the New York Times : " When we reasonably deter mine our attackers ' bases and camps , we must pulverize them -- minimizing but accepting the risk of collateral damage -- and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terror 's national hosts . " <p> The following examines the history of Osama bin Laden and the links of the Islamic jihad ( holy war ) to the formulation of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War and its aftermath . <p> Prime suspect in the September 11 , 2001 , hijackings , branded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an " international terrorist " for his role in the African U.S. embassy bombings , Saudi-born Osama bin Laden was recruited during the Soviet-Afghan war " ironically under the auspices of the CIA , to fight Soviet invaders " -- so reports the August 24 , 1998 , London Daily Telegraph . According to Fred Halliday in the March 25 , 1996 , New Republic , " The largest covert operation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in support of the pro-communist government of Babrak Kamal . And Ahmed Rashid writes in the November/December 1999 Foreign Affairs : <p> With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistan 's ISI Inter Services Intelligence , who wanted to turn the Afghan jihad into a global war waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union , some 35,000 Muslim radicals from 40 Islamic countries joined Afghanistan 's fight between 1982 and 1992 . Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs . Eventually more than 100,000 foreign Muslim radicals were directly influenced by the Afghan jihad . <p> The Islamic jihad was supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia , with a significant part of the funding generated from the Golden Crescent drug trade . Steve Coil writes in the July 19 , 1992 , Washington Post : <p> In March 1985 , President Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive 166 ... which authorized stepped-up covert military aid to the mujahideen , and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal : to defeat Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal . The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic increase in arms supplies -- a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987 ... as well as a " ceaseless stream " of CIA and Pentagon specialists who traveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan 's ISI on the main road near Rawalpindi , Pakistan . There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels . <p> The CIA 's covert support was provided indirectly , using Pakistan 's military ISI as a " go-between . " Washington had concluded that , for these covert operations to be " successful , " it must not reveal the ultimate objective of the jihad , which was to destroy the Soviet Union . The CIA played a key role in training the mujahideen by channeling CIA support through the ISI , which integrated the guerrilla training with the teachings of Islam . As Dilip Hiro of the International Press Service explains : <p> Predominant themes were that Islam was a complete socio-political ideology , that holy Islam was being violated by the atheistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reassert their independence by overthrowing the leftist Afghan regime propped up by Moscow . <p> The CIA 's Milton Beardman stated , " We did n't train Arabs . " Yet according to Abdel Monam Saidali , of the Al-aram Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo , bin Laden and the " Afghan Arabs " had been imparted " with very sophisticated types of training that was allowed to them by the CIA . " Beardman confirmed that Osama bin Laden was n't aware of the role he was playing on behalf of Washington and reported bin Laden as saying , " Neither I , nor my brothers , saw evidence of American help . " <p> Motivated by nationalism and religious fervor , the Islamic warriors were therefore unaware that they were fighting the Soviet army on behalf of Uncle Sam . And while there were contacts at the upper levels of the intelligence hierarchy , Islamic rebel leaders in theater had no contacts with Washington or the CIA . With CIA backing and the funneling of massive amounts of U.S. military aid , the ISI had developed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India Abroad , as a " parallel structure wielding enormous power over all aspects of government . " The ISI had a staff composed of military and intelligence officers , bureaucrats , undercover agents , and informers , collectively estimated at 150,000 . <p> Meanwhile , CIA operations had also reinforced the Pakistani military regime led by General Zia Ul Haq . According to Diego Cordovez and Selig Harrison , as quoted in an International Press Service review of their book , Out of Afghanistan : The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal : <p> " Relations between the CIA and the ISI had grown increasingly warm following Zia 's ouster of Bhutto and the advent of a military regime . " ... During most of the Afghan war , Pakistan was more aggressively anti-Soviet than even the United States . Soon after the Soviet military invaded Afghanistan in 1980 , Zia sent his ISI chief to destabilize the Soviet Central Asian states . The CIA only agreed to this plan in October 1984 .... " The CIA was more cautious than the Pakistanis . " Both Pakistan and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public posture of negotiating a settlement while privately agreeing that military escalation was the best course . <p> The history of the drug , trade in Central Asia is intimately related to the CIAs covert operations . Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war , opium production in Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets . There was no local production of heroin . However , with CIA intervention , that changed . Alfred McCoy 's study , " Drug Fallout : The CIA 's Forty Year Complicity in the Narcotics Trade , " in the August 1997 Progressive , confirms that , within two years of the onslaught of the CIA operations in Afghanistan , <p> the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands became the world 's top heroin producer , supplying 60 percent of U.S. demand . In Pakistan , the heroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979 ... to 1.2 million by 1985 -- a much steeper rise than in any other nation .... <p> CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade . As the Mujahideen guerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan , they ordered peasants to plant opium as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence operated hundreds of heroin laboratories . During this decade of wide-open drug-dealing , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to instigate major seizures or arrests .... U.S. officials had refused to investigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies " because U.S. narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the war against Soviet influence there . " In 1995 , the former CIA director of the Afghan operation , Charles Cogan , admitted the CIA had indeed sacrificed the drug war to fight the Cold War . " Our main mission was to do as much damage as possible to the Soviets . We did n't really have the resources or the time to devote to an investigation of the drug trade .... I do n't think that we need to apologize for this . Every situation has its fallout .... There was fallout in terms of drugs , yes . But the main objective was accomplished . The Soviets left Afghanistan . " <p> In the wake of the Cold War , the Central Asian region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continued to produce three-quarters of the world 's opium , representing multibillion-dollar revenues to business syndicates , financial institutions , intelligence agencies , and organized crime . The annual proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade -- between $100 billion and $200 billion -- represents approximately one-third of the worldwide annual turnover of narcotics , estimated by the United Nations to be of the order of $500 billion . <p> With the disintegration of the Soviet Union , a new surge in opium production unfolded . According to UN estimates , the production of opium in Afghanistan in 1998 to 1999-coinciding with the buildup of armed insurgencies in the former Soviet republics -- reached a record high of 4,600 metric tons . Powerful business syndicates in the former Soviet Union allied with organized crime to compete for strategic control over the heroin routes . <p> The ISI 's extensive intelligence military network was n't dismantled after the Cold War , and the CIA continued to covertly support the Islamic jihad through Pakistan . New undercover initiatives were set in motion in Central Asia , the Caucasus , and the Balkans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a catalyst for the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of six new Muslim republics in Central Asia , " reports the International Press Service . <p> Meanwhile , Islamic missionaries of the Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia had established themselves in the Muslim republics , as well as within the Russian federation encroaching upon the institutions of the secular state . Despite its anti-American ideology , Islamic fundamentalism was largely serving Washington 's strategic interests in the former Soviet Union . <p> Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989 , the civil war in Afghanistan continued unabated . The Taliban was being supported by the Pakistani Deobandis and its political party , the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam ( JUI ) . In 1993 , the JUI entered the government coalition of Prime Minister Benazzir Bhutto . Ties between the JUI , the army , and the ISI were established . In 1995 , with the downfall of the Hezb-I-Islami Hektmatyar government in Kabul , the Taliban not only instated a hardline Islamic government but , according to Ahmed Rashid , also handed control of training camps in Afghanistan over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the Saudi Wahhabi movements , played a key role in recruiting volunteers to fight in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union . Jane Defense Weekly confirms in this regard that " half of Taliban manpower and equipment originates in Pakistan under the ISI . " <p> In fact , it would appear that , following the Soviet withdrawal , both sides in the Afghan civil war continued to receive covert CIA support through Pakistan 's ISI . In other words , backed by Pakistan 's military intelligence , which in turn was controlled by the CIA , the Taliban Islamic State was largely serving U.S. geopolitical interests . The Golden Crescent drug trade was also being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army ( starting in the early 1990s ) and the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) . In recent months there is evidence that mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of KLA-NLA terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia . <p> No doubt , this explains why , until recent events , Washington had mostly closed its eyes to the reign of terror imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rights , the closing down of schools for girls , the dismissal of women employees from government offices , and the enforcement of the Sharia laws of punishment . <p> With regard to Chechnya , the main rebels -- Shamil Basayev and Al Khattab -- were trained and indoctrinated in CIA-sponsored camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan . According to Yossef Bodansky , director of the U.S. Congress 's Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare , the conflict in Chechnya had been planned during a secret summit of HizbAllah International held in 1996 in Mogadishu , Somalia . The summit was attended by Osama bin Laden and high-ranking Iranian and Pakistani intelligence officers . According to Levon Sevunts in the October 26 , 1999 , Montreal Gazette , the involvement of Pakistan 's ISI in Chechnya " goes far beyond supplying the Chechens with weapons and expertise : the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually calling the shots in this war . " <p> Russia 's main pipeline route transits through Chechnya and Dagestan . Despite Washington 's perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism , the indirect beneficiaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline corridors out of the Caspian Sea basin . <p> The two main Chechen rebel armies -- estimated at 35,000 strong and led respectively by Commander Shamil Basayev and Emir Khattab -- were supported by Pakistan 's ISI , which also played a key role in organizing and training the Chechen rebel army . Sevunts writes that , in 1994 , <p> the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence arranged for Basayev and his trusted lieutenants to undergo intensive Islamic indoctrination and training in guerrilla warfare in the Khost province of Afghanistan at Amir Muawia camp , set up in the early 1980s by the CIA and ISI and run by famous Afghani warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . In July 1994 , upon graduating from Amir Muawia , Basayev was transferred to Markaz-i-Dawar camp in Pakistan to undergo training in advanced guerrilla tactics . In Pakistan , Basayev met the highest ranking Pakistani military and intelligence officers : Minister of Defense General Aftab Shahban Mirani , Minister of Interior General Naserullah Babar , and the head of the ISI branch in charge of supporting Islamic causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High-level connections soon proved very useful to Basayev . <p> Following his training and indoctrination stint , Basayev was assigned to lead the assault against Russian federal troops in the first Chechen war in 1995 . His organization also developed extensive links to criminal syndicates in Moscow , as well as ties to Albanian organized crime and the Kosovo Liberation Army . In 1997 and 1998 , according to Russia 's Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , " Chechen warlords started buying up real estate in Kosovo ... through several real estate firms registered as a cover in Yugoslavia . " <p> Basayev 's organization has also been involved in a number of rackets including narcotics , illegal tapping and sabotage of Russia 's oil pipelines , kidnapping , prostitution , trade in counterfeit currency , and the smuggling of nuclear materials ( see " Mafia Linked to Albania 's Collapsed Pyramids " in the February 13 , 1997 , European , as well as the January 4-5 , 2000 , Itar-Tass ) . Alongside the extensive laundering of drug money , the proceeds of various illicit activities have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . <p> During his training in Afghanistan , Basayev linked up with Saudi-born veteran mujahideen commander Al Khattab , who had fought as a volunteer in Afghanistan . Barely a few months after Basayev 's return to Grozny , Khattab was invited in early 1995 to set up an army base in Chechnya for the training of mujahideen fighters . According to the BBC in September 1999 , Khattab 's posting to Chechnya had been " arranged through the Saudi-Arabian based International Islamic Relief Organisation , a militant religious organisation , funded by mosques and rich individuals which channeled funds into Chechnya . " <p> Since the Cold War era , Washington has consciously supported Osama bin Laden , while at the same time placing him on the FBI s ' most wanted list as the world s foremost terrorist . While the mujahideen are busy fighting the United States ' war in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union , the FBI -- operating as a U.S.-based police force -- is waging a domestic war against terrorism , operating in some respects independently of the CIA which has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert operations . <p> In a cruel irony , while the Islamic jihad -- featured by the Bush administration as " a threat to America " -- is blamed for the terrorist assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , as well as the hijacking of the fourth plane downed in Pennsylvania , these same Islamic organizations constitute a key instrument of U.S. military-intelligence operations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union . <p> In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , the truth must prevail to prevent the Bush administration , together with its " coalition " partners , from expanding on a military adventure that threatens the future of humanity . <p> By Michael Chossudovsky <p> <p> Michel Chossudovsky is a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa , Canada , and director of the Centre for Research and Globalisation .

##4000972 To terrorists and their sympathizers worldwide , the World Trade Center symbolized W the global nature of corporate money and power -- a seemingly neverending expansion of capitalism , siphoning funds and resources from people everywhere and fostering gaps in wealth the likes of which the world has never before seen . The Pentagon symbolizes the U.S. military 's protection and enforcement of this global system . Because much of the resulting poverty and suffering exist in the Muslim world , Osama bin Laden has had less difficulty recruiting his minions . The resultant widespread discontent fuels terrorism -- a reality brought home to the developed world on September 11 , 2001 . <p> Fortunately , there is another movement growing alongside those of global capitalism and terrorism . This movement -- the anti-global-capitalism movement that awakened in Seattle in November 1999 -- unlike violent terrorism , should n't be viewed as a threat to the majority of the global village . Rather , this rapid mobilization should be welcomed and encouraged . For the ultimate threat to humanity is economic globalism . <p> Today 's globalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think and act in terms of human consequences . This globalism has bullied and seeped its way into every nook of humanity , and the results are scary : loss of democracy , human rights violations , rapid environmental degradation , expanding inequality . The anti-global-capitalism movement is n't afraid of globalization ( it is itself a global phenomenon ) ; rather , it fears globalization as designated according to the imperialistic goals of a few rich people . The aim of the growing unrest -- from Seattle to Washington , D.C. , to Quebec City to Genoa and beyond -- is to shift the focus of globalization to benefit all of humanity . New World Order = Old World Order <p> The brand of globalization being pursued by the financial and trade institutions ( Inter national Monetary Fund , World Bank , World Trade Organization ) that has become the target of mass protest continues a centuries-old trend of colonialism in the developing world that supposedly ended in the twentieth century . When oppressed natives forced European countries , depleted by the devastation of two world wars , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outdated human rights abuses such as slavery , theft of resources , and genocide . The Old World Order gave way to the New World Order . <p> Unfortunately , the greed that was the impetus of brutal imperialism never left us . Thanks to decisions made by the financial elite behind closed doors , the New World Order mirrors the cycle of the Old World Order . Forced labor has given way to sweatshop labor . Military uniforms have been replaced ( usually ) by fancy Italian suits and cell phones . Resource extraction has expanded , as the conquistadors ' search for gold today includes oil , timber , rubber , and even fresh water . Instead of the churches of yesterday 's brand of imperialism , now McDonald 's and Starbucks assimilate the savages . Genocide persists as indigenous peoples across the globe fight to survive . In an even more troubling trend , inequality is reaching heights never achieved during the Old World Order . Do n't Believe the Elite <p> In order to understand the movement , it 's necessary to decode " elite speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing the ultra-elite five corporations that own the national media in the United States , have yet to generate critical analysis of the movement surrounding these huge protests . The New York Times ' Thomas Friedman , in typical fashion , dismissed an issue , which sparked fire in the bellies of millions , when he wrote , " To be against globalization is to be against so many things -- from cell phones to trade to Big Macs -- that it connotes nothing . " What he was really saying is : " Do n't mess with a good thing . Myself , my friends , my coworkers , and especially my bosses profit tremendously from the current system . " <p> We must also ignore the " wisdom " of our so-called elected leaders . During every meeting of world leaders , behind huge police barricades , George W. Bush ( or Bill Clinton ) addressed the media with these words , " To be against free trade is to be against poor people . " The elite British publication the Economist continually echoes these sentiments . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst scenario for the world 's poor would be if the protesters had their way and the process of corporate-controlled globalization was stopped . Due to the United States ' lack of access to independent voices in this prolonged era of media consolidation , it is no wonder most Americans do n't understand the movement . And yet it continues to grow . The Washington Consensus <p> The United States is the sole superpower in the world and thus enjoys undue influence on the global village 's economic and political aspirations . This influence has a name : the Washington Consensus . Washington , D.C. , has the necessary tools at its disposal to ensure that policies will be in place worldwide to benefit the interests of its constituents . Anyone familiar with the role of money in U.S. politics understands that the constituents of our political system are n't average , ordinary citizens . The United States government primarily works for corporate interests . Primary shareholders and CEOs have the ear of almost all national politicians and the economists of the international financial institutions . WTO : Democracy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three men , appointed by the richest countries in the world . It 's the arm of the Washington Consensus that controls trade in the world . While its stated aim is to allow trade to exist sans artificial barriers , the WTO ensures that " free trade " will benefit corporate interests . A casual examination of its record will horrify anyone who believes in the advantages of democracy . <p> A country that joins the WTO must abide by the rulings of the tribunal or face severe economic punishment . This allows the Washington Consensus to breach the sanctity of another nation 's domestic policy . For example , a vast majority of Europeans are against genetically modified ( GM ) foods . They are primarily worried about the health and safety implications , as genetically altered products are introduced to the market without proper testing . The effects of a large number of GM foods are unknown . Also , European small farmers are anti-GM because U.S. corporations ( Monsanto being the largest and most ominous ) are establishing a monopoly on the product and driving many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States have already suffered the effects of these monopoly conditions , as the small American farm is almost nonexistent . <p> The European Union , unable to ignore the clamor of the people , created laws making it exceedingly difficult for GM foods to find a successful niche in the marketplace . In Europe , GM foods must be labeled as such -- a measure that has been fought tooth and nail in the United States . The United States took its case to the WTO on behalf of its constituents ( like Monsanto ) , and the WTO ruled that Europe had created a barrier to free trade : Europe either had to capitulate or pay exorbitant fines . European countries , being less financially strapped than most , agreed to pay the fines rather than outrage the masses . Less fortunate countries do n't enjoy that luxury . <p> Within South Africa lives the largest population of AIDS victims in the world . In a country as poor as South Africa , AIDS medicine is far too expensive . While U.S. AIDS patients ( those lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living longer lives thanks to a combination of expensive drugs now available , South Africans continue to be ravaged by the epidemic . These drugs , trademarked by U.S. pharmaceutical companies but developed thanks to public subsidies , cost more than the average South African is able to earn in a week . For years , the pharmaceutical companies did n't lower prices due to concerns that the drugs would be illegally imported via the black market back to the United States , rupturing their hold on the U.S. market . In the meantime , millions died of the disease throughout Africa . <p> In 1995 , then-president of South Africa Nelson Mandela legalized the generic reproduction of these drugs . Al Gore , the U.S. vice-president at the time and a recipient of huge campaign contributions from pharmaceutical interests , took the matter to the WTO , which predictably ruled in favor of the United States and the pharmaceutical corporations . It was n't until 1999 , thanks to worldwide public outcry , that the WTO overturned its decision . Who knows how many lives could have been saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim of WTO rulings , as well . The state of Massachusetts , following the lead of many towns and counties nationwide , voted to stop doing business with the brutal military dictatorship of Myanmar ( Burma ) . Any corporation using Burmese labor or resources was n't allowed to sell its goods in the state of Massachusetts . This is an example of voter activism that has gained momentum in the last few years . <p> Japan , however , on behalf of Mitsubishi , Toyota , and other corporations , threatened to take the issue to the WTO . The European Union , conveniently forgetting its sovereignty issues with GM foods , followed the Japanese lead . U.S. state and local governments are unable to defend themselves against WTO policy , so Massachusetts was forced to rely on the Clinton administration . Since Clinton was the quintessential big business president , the Massachusetts law was doomed . The National Foreign Trade Council ( fronting a group of major corporations ) has taken Massachusetts to federal court , making it an issue of state versus federal powers . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be hollow . Clinton or Bush ( or Gore , for that matter ) is not an issue here -- all of them side with the WTO and its corporate interests . <p> The quality of the environment is also at risk . The United States ' Clean Air Act -- intended to ban the use of gasoline that releases too many pollutants into the air -- is no longer valid . Venezuela , a major oil and gas producing country , took the United States to the WTO . It seems the Clean Air Act was a trade barrier , unfairly discriminating against Venezuelan gas that did n't meet U.S. standards . The WTO ruled in favor of Venezuela and against clean air . Gas that is less safe and more toxic is now allowed to be pumped into our millions of cars . <p> Species of the world must also be aware of economic globalism and its tools . The Endangered Species Act prohibits the sale in the United States of fish which have been caught in nets that do n't allow for the release of endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia , and the Philippines -- homes to many fishing companies that have yet to invest in the more expensive , safe nets -- took the case to the WTO , which ruled in favor of fishing interests . Keeping sea turtles alive is a barrier to free trade . At the WTO Seattle protests , many of the environmental activists dressed in sea turtle costumes -- they were the only sea turtles with a voice . IMF and World Bank : Financing Destruction <p> If the WTO is economic globalism 's tool to ensure that trade goes according to plan , then the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are the strong arms of finance that benefit the global elite . These two institutions have two major functions : create a risk-free environment for predatory , speculative financing and open world markets to investors . The IMF and World Bank are part of the Bretton Woods system established in 1944 to devise rules of investment in the postwar era . One priority was to limit and control the movement of capital , understanding that unregulated flow of money across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bretton Woods was dismantled by the Nixon administration in the early 1970s . Before this , most capital flowed in order to benefit economic growth and development . Now it is estimated that 95 percent of capital is speculative , which results in quick returns for the investors and dangerous instability for markets worldwide . This instability led to the Asian crisis of the late 1990s , the near collapse of the Mexican economy , and market volatility in the wake of the terrorist attacks . <p> The huge amounts of money that are lost by lending institutions when an economy crashes are then subsidized . The private banks that lent billions in unwise speculative loans to Asian countries prior to the collapse were operating risk free . The IMF and World Bank loaned the crisis-stricken countries huge amounts of money ( generated from the taxes of the rich countries ) at very high interest rates , insisting private bank repayment be their first priority . The poor people of the poor countries must then bear the brunt of repaying these loans . Taxes are raised and austerity measures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted from poor country to rich country . Your Domestic is Our Policy <p> Austerity measures are how the Washington Consensus ensures that the domestic policy of other countries measures up to the needs of foreign investors . Social programs , such as health care and public education , are dismantled so taxes can be funneled into repaying the debt . The indebted countries are then forced to privatize their public resources . Energy is deregulated at a cost that makes the California crisis laughable . Communal property , including farmland , is sold to corporations . Exporting agriculture then becomes the number one priority . <p> In Brazil , for example , almost the entire country 's fertile soil was sold to corporate agribusiness . Now much of the land is used to raise cattle that are exported to the North American fast food culture . The Brazilian people , deprived of their land , either wind up in huge , overcrowded slums in cities like Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro or they penetrate further and further into the rainforest , destroying the delicate natural ecosystem . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include forcing indebted countries to rid themselves of pesky labor laws . This is how horrible conditions in modern-day sweatshops are allowed to exist . In the neverending race to the bottom , companies such as Nike and the Gap search for factory locations where they can pay the least possible wages and where unions are n't allowed to exist . In the process , the manufacturing base in the United States is destroyed . As reported in the Washington Post , most of the record one million people added to the ranks of the unemployed in the United States during August 2001 were from the manufacturing industry . This race to the bottom is increasing rates of inequality like never before . Even the Economist , which ironically touted the course of globalization , recently admitted that inequality has skyrocketed in the past decade . Of course , it also attempted to argue that inequality does n't matter . <p> For those of us who believe issues of economic equality do matter , the lending policies of the World Bank and IMF are immoral , not to mention illegal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancelled -- a major argument of many in the anti-global-capitalism movement . One could argue that , beyond debt cancellation , those who profit due to this immoral system should pay reparations . The theft of land and labor should be a punishable offense . Awareness and Responsibility <p> While the anti-global-capitalism movement continues to grow , most U.S. citizens remain tragically unaware . The story is different in many of the poorer countries . Despite a general lack of power , citizens groups throughout the developing world are standing up to the dangerous effects of economic globalism . In India , indigenous communities have successfully denied IMF dam projects that threatened to displace thousands . In Bolivia , there have been huge citywide strikes ; earlier this year , the capital , La Paz , was shut down by a general strike protesting the high cost of living and the displacement of indigenous communities due to IMF projects . <p> Water has also become a huge issue . On April 8 , 2000 , citywide protests shut down Bolivia 's third largest city , Cochabamba . People were protesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the increase of the cost of water beyond what the typical Bolivian could afford . <p> U.S. groups , such as San Francisco 's Global Exchange , are getting people from developing world countries together with concerned Americans , creating what they call " people-to-people ties . " The awareness created is beneficial . Those involved in the movement in the developing world , when asked how people in the United States can help their cause , repeatedly reply , " Change your country . " Change in the United States -- something its citizens can control -- would be the greatest benefit to those feeling the consequences of economic globalism ; after all , it is the United States that is leading the charge of the all-consuming corporate globalization . This is something Americans could previously ignore . In light of September 11 , this does n't seem to be the case anymore . <p> The more people become aware of the issues , the more progress is made toward the eventual goal of eliminating the dehumanizing and wasteful reign of global capitalism . In this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-increasing global awareness . <p> People who search for a single solution to the challenges of economic globalism will be disappointed with the overall anti-global-capitalism movement . The most zing aspect of it is the diversity of ideas it stimulates . But there are some common goals . Real , participatory democracy is an aim of everyone involved . It is assumed within the movement that people know best how to shape their own economic and political institutions -- not the capitalists whose priorities are to increase profit at any cost . Localism is a huge facet of the movement ( explaining the reemerging success of farmers ' markets ) . The microbrewery mission statement sums up this intent : " Think globally , drink locally . " <p> While decentralization of the global financial institutions is one goal of the anti-global-capitalism movement , globalization of ideas can be extremely beneficial . The movement 's most significant victory was undermining the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment ( MAI ) , a multinational agreement that would have given investors even more power over government . This success is owed to a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet . <p> Most in the anti-global-capitalism movement believe that to measure economies solely according to resource and monetary accumulation is anti-human . Quality-of-life indicators are becoming a part of the global discussion -- another success credited to the movement . Rather than measure the success of an economy according to gross domestic product ( which includes , among other anti-human measurements , the cost of weapons building and pollution cleanup expenses ) , quality-of-life indicators measure an economy by how well the people are doing . These take into account infant mortality rates , hunger rates , literacy rates , and the like . Redefining the world according to people , not profit , is the ultimate objective . <p> As the United States scrambles to punish the perpetrators of terrorism within its borders , the anti-global-capitalism movement will need to up the ante . It ca n't let violence define a worldwide mobilization to end the brutality of the current economic system . It also ca n't let governments mistake protesters for terrorists in the almost certain crackdown on civil liberties . There is a huge difference between terrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main perpetrator , the United States . However , the anti-global-capitalism movement seeks to create a world that does n't feel so powerless that it resorts to terror -- neither the terror witnessed in New York City and Washington this past September nor the state-sponsored terror the United States uses to promote global capitalism . <p> By Andrew Hartman <p> <p> Andrew Hartman is a gradute student of history at George Washington University in Washington , D.C.

##4000973 Section : the ghosts of war <p> An autumn chill settled grey and dreary over he harbor as water churned between the U.S.S. Leonard Wood and its ratty old pier . New York City 's spires jutted from misty shrouds as wind sliced into the matching cap and coat Mom had bundled me in that morning . Then , while our ocean liner 's bow cut through the bay , gulls circling its stern screeched warily at a blast from the ship 's horn . Looking back , it was a lonely , ominous sound . <p> Our first night out , the ship plunged through foaming Atlantic swells that sent Mom to bed with what she called " terminal mal de mer , " but dawn broke on a tranquil ocean and balmy skies . After entering the Panama Canal , my father , a U.S. Army doctor with orders to the Philippines , took us on a shopping spree in Cristobal . I got a toy gun , and Mom picked a Chinese rug from a rack that soared to the shop 's ceiling like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rug around a wooden peg then had it stowed in our cabin ; but when the sun struck our porthole just right , I would peel back its fringes and the deep blue nap glistened as if it had been kissed by a morning dew . At last it was unrolled in our new house on a sunny street bordering the parade ground , two blocks from Wheeler Field , but I digress . <p> While the Leonard Wood 's wake melted into a slate green Pacific , its wireless operator translated the dashes and dots of a communique to my father from the War Department . Did we know it was a reprieve , a call from the governor 's office to our executioner ? Not then , but our destination had been changed from Manila to Honolulu , Hawaii . If that spinning ball had n't dropped into just the right slot , my children would never have been born . <p> What followed our arrival in Hawaii were breezes perfumed by fragrant tropical flowers , tasty avocados falling from a tree in our front yard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to me from A. A. Milne 's Pooh Bear series , and I would tag along some golf course with my father and Maxy . <p> We still had horse soldiers in those days . Major Maxy Noble , a West Pointer , cavalry officer , and my father 's best friend , would drop by our house for " one " beer , then he and Dad would spend lazy afternoons in the backyard , swapping lies and cussing Franklin Delano Roosevelt . But every time he knocked on our lanai 's screen door , Maxy gleamed and glittered . A saber dangled from his left hip and silver spurs spun on cavalry boots that held a spit-shine like I 've never seen since . A Sam Browne belt 's diagonal strap ran across his chest to disappear under a khaki epaulet . But mostly it was the hat . Its leather noose rose jauntily from just below his dimple , hugging square jaws up to a wide brim with a dome circled by gold braid and tassels on its front . Shazzam ! He was Captain Marvel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A pat on the head from this swashbuckler would be enough for most pre-TV preschoolers , but it got better , much better . I told you there was a parade ground across our street . The U.S. Cavalry drilled there ; twice a month Maxy would lead three columns of mounted , steely-eyed soldiers to " troop the line . " Awestruck , I squatted on a curb with the neighborhood kids , waiting for him to spur his steed toward us , then with practiced dexterity he 'd reach down and I 'd vault into space . Straddling his charger I 'd clasp that Sam Browne belt while we cantered to a reviewing stand amid pennants popping in tropical breezes . A metallic whisper of steel and sunlight glinting on his saber was a prelude to his crisp command , " Eyyyes , RIGHT ! " His blade would flash , tip freezing at a perfect forty-five-degree angle to the ground quivering with hoofbeats , and every head in the trailing columns snapped right . After the last trooper cleared the reviewing stand , Maxy would wheel his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the peanut gallery . His horse would slow when we approached my pals , and Maxy would lower me into a sprint , usually resulting in an end-over-end tumble . But I 'd rise like a victorious phoenix ; these kids were now my troopers ! <p> Then the long shadow fell across my world : Maxy and his band were ordered to Manila . I wept when he left because the elegance of our island dissolved like wisps of rising smoke . Even though other people inhabited my life , Maxy Noble was gone . <p> Under the avocado tree , if I faced our front door , the Momms lived on our left . Captain Momm , a signal officer , was built like a tank : short , wide , and with a nose like a cannon . His wife Anna , lithe and stately , saw darker visions that I yet understood . My mother said her parents were white Russians and that during the revolution there a Red Army firing squad had forced her to watch their execution . No wonder her smile seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our right . I do n't remember his name or rank , but she and her daughter have tugged at my memory for six decades . Jewell and Billie Jewell . On weekends , if I got up early enough , Jewell Walker served fluffy pancakes or magic waffles , dripping in Log Cabin syrup , with crispy bacon as an extra . Sometimes Billie Jewell -- a worldly , older woman of twelve , with glowing cheeks and honey-colored hair -- would attend . I adored her . <p> A couple of months after Maxy sailed , Miz Walker took me to a circus and , when we got home , Adams was there ; that meant my parents were going out . Adams was an orderly at my father 's dispensary and had this marvelous scar on the back of his right hand where a tattoo had been removed . As my parents drove away in our grey 1938 Olds , a swooping fighter plane rattled the rafters -- no rare occurrence , since our house had been built in Wheeler Field 's flight path . Adams fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was telling me about his scar for the zillionth time as I fell asleep , not knowing or caring that the next day 's dawn would change history . <p> BOOM ! When I leapt from bed , sunshine sparkled n rattling panes . BOOM ! BOOM ! BOOM ! " Pat ! " Mom screamed . " Did a plane hit the house ? " <p> My father looked out the bathroom window . " Plane hell , " he yelled . " It 's the god-damned Japs ! " <p> By this time , I was in Mom 's bed . " Everybody downstairs , " Dad ordered . " Hurry ! " Our stairwell featured a tall window facing Wheeler Field , where the Army Air Corps had fighter squadrons . " They 'll make short work of these bastards , " Dad snarled . But as we clattered down our stairs , the window , sill to sill and side to side , showed only billowing black smoke lined with flashes of orange . Dad pushed us into an alcove under the stairs , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . An announcer 's excited voice confirmed that Hickam and Wheeler Fields were under attack , as was Pearl Harbor . When Dad returned to the stairwell , he wore a braided cap . " There 'll be a lot of wounded boys , Helen . " <p> " You ca n't leave ! " Mom wailed . But he did . On foot . Dodging and weaving between buildings all the way to the hospital -- if he 'd taken our Olds , Japanese bullets would have riddled him . Minutes later , Jewell and Billie Jewell bounded across the backyard and pounded on our kitchen door . Mom let them in , then calmly set her coffee pot on a burner to heat . <p> The bombs were closer now . And louder . They really whistle on the way down , you know , and their explosions rattled our house like earthquakes . The radio reported that ships were blazing in the harbor and columns of smoke were drifting over the airfields . Then suddenly our lanai door banged and Anna Momm , eyes flashing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she yanked our couch away from the wall and scrambled behind it on all fours , Mom shrugged , then Jewell followed her into the kitchen . Billie Jewell was crying in the alcove under the stairs when I jumped onto the couch and peeked over its back ; Anna was curled up , sobbing and shaking so hard I was afraid she 'd shatter . <p> As I ran for the kitchen to tell Mom , the roar of a plane shook our walls ; she was carrying her coffee pot .... The howling engine became chattering machine gunfire ! A window over our sink exploded into spraying glass and wood , knocking the pot from her hand and slamming it against a wall as Jewell 's screams ricocheted through the plane 's exhaust fumes . <p> The rest of the morning we huddled in our living room , listening to a radio tell us to boil the water we cooked with or drank , and reporting death and casualty counts . Bombs still whistled , sometimes closer , sometimes more distant . A house up the street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate moans from behind the couch .

They were grotesque : bluish-grey rubber with black hoses and round glass eyes staring vacantly . He was trying to fit one on me when Mom asked how he 'd gotten them . He said they had belonged to soldiers who had been killed that morning . Blood pounding , I fled , but he told Mom to do it because there could be an invasion that night . When he returned to the dispensary I wondered if I 'd ever see this aloof , pensive man again . <p> Fouled by smoke and flame , twilight glimmered across my tropical paradise while large army trucks , covered from cab to tailgate by arched brown canvas , lumbered down our street .

Finally , at the main thoroughfare , our truck joined a convoy and the MP told us we were being taken to an abandoned schoolhouse in the mountains . It was dark now , and after awhile I noticed a strange orange flicker on the canvas , then a wisp of wind caught its flap , blowing it back from the cab . In that instant I saw what our priest once described at mass as a flaming hell . <p> Pearl Harbor was on fire ! Dark superstructures swayed gently on a flame-laced tapestry while other vessels , listing severely , had cables running to less damaged ships .

Did that aristocratic woman ever recover from two of the twentieth century 's versions of politics run amuck ? And I hope Adams survived to have children who pestered him , as I had , about his scar . I thought about the Walkers -- particularly Billie Jewell .

##4000974 Hermina Morita has a grand vision for Hawaii 's energy future . A state representative , Morita chairs a legislative committee to reduce Hawaii 's dependence on oil , which accounts for 88 percent of its energy and is mainly imported on tankers from Asia and Alaska . In April 2001 , the committee approved a $200,000 " jumpstart " grant to support a public/private partnership in hydrogen research and development , tapping the island state 's plentiful geothermal , solar , and wind resources to split water and produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells to power buses and cars , homes and businesses , and military and fishing fleets . <p> The grant grew out of a consultant study suggesting that hydrogen could become widely cost-effective in Hawaii this decade . The University of Hawaii , meanwhile , has received $2 million from the U.S. Department of Defense for a fuel cell project . Possibilities include Hawaii becoming a mid-Pacific refueling point , shipping its own hydrogen to Oceania , other states , and Japan . Instead of importing energy , Morita told a San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capable of producing more hydrogen than we need , so we can send the excess to California . " <p> Leaders of the tiny South Pacific island of Vanuatu have similar aspirations . In September 2000 , President John Bani appealed to international donors and energy experts to help prepare a feasibility study for developing a hydrogen-based renewable energy economy . The economically depressed and climactically vulnerable island , which spends nearly as much money on petroleum-based products as it receives from all of its exports , hopes to become 100 percent renewable-energy-based by 2020 . Like Hawaii , it has abundant geothermal and solar energy , which can be used to make hydrogen . And like Hawaii , it hopes to become an exporter , providing energy to neighboring islands . " As part of the hydrogen power and renewable energy initiative we will strive to provide electricity to every village in Vanuatu , " the government announced in its October 5 , 2000 , issue of Environment News Service . <p> Hawaii and Vanuatu are following the lead of yet another island , Iceland , which amazed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's first hydrogen society . Iceland , which spent $185 million -- a quarter of its trade deficit-on oil imports in 2000 , has joined forces with Shell Hydrogen , DaimlerChrysler , and Norsk Hydro in a multimillion-dollar initiative to convert the island 's buses , cars , and boats to hydrogen and fuel cells over the next thirty to forty years . The brainchild of a chemist named Bragi Arnason and nicknamed " Professor Hydrogen , " the project will begin in the capital of Reykjavik , with the city 's bus fleet drawing on hydrogen from a nearby fertilizer plant and later refilling from a station that produces hydrogen on site from abundant supplies of geothermal and hydroelectric energy -- which furnish 99 percent of Iceland 's power . If the project is successful , the island hopes to become a " Kuwait of the North , " exporting hydrogen to Europe and other countries . " Iceland is already a world leader in using renewable energy , " announced Thorsteinn Sigfusson , chair of the venture , in March 2001 , adding that the bus project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first hydrogen economy . " <p> Jules Verne would be pleased -- though not surprised -- to see his vision of a planet powered by hydrogen unfolding in this way . After all , it was in an 1874 book entitled The Mysterious Island that Verne first sketched a world in which water -- and the hydrogen that , along with oxygen , composed it -- would be " the coal of the future . " A century and a quarter later , the idea of using hydrogen -- the simplest , lightest , and most abundant element in the universe -- as a primary form of energy is beginning to move from the pages of science fiction and into speeches of industry executives . " Greenery , innovation , and market forces are shaping the future of our industry and propelling us inexorably toward hydrogen energy , " Texaco executive Frank Ingriselli explained in April 2001 to members of the Science Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives . " Those who do n't pursue it , will rue it . " <p> Indeed , several converging forces explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advent of greater competition in the energy industry are part of the equation . But equally important motivations for exploring hydrogen are the energy-related problems of energy security , air pollution , and climate change -- problems that are collectively calling into question the fundamental sustainability of the current energy system . These factors reveal why islands , stationed on the front lines of vulnerability to high oil prices and climate change , are in the vanguard of the hydrogen transition . <p> Yet Iceland and other nations represent just the bare beginning in terms of the changes that lie ahead in the energy world . The commercial implications of a transition to hydrogen as the world 's major energy currency will be staggering , putting the $2 trillion energy industry through its greatest tumult since the early days of Standard Oil and Rockefeller . Over 100 companies are aiming to commercialize fuel cells for a broad range of applications -- from cell phones , laptop computers , and soda machines to homes , offices , and factories to vehicles of all kinds . Hydrogen is also being researched for direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spending between $500 million and $1 billion annually on hydrogen . Leading energy suppliers are creating hydrogen divisions , while major carmakers are pouring billions of dollars into a race to put the first fuel cell vehicles on the market between 2003 and 2005 . In California , twenty-three auto , fuel , and fuel cell companies and seven government agencies are partnering to fuel and test drive seventy cars and buses over the next few years . Hydrogen and fuel cell companies have captured the attention of venture capitalist firms and investment banks anxious to get into the hot new space known as ET , or energy technology . <p> The geopolitical implications of hydrogen are enormous as well . Coal fueled the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century rise of Great Britain and modern Germany ; in the twentieth century , oil laid the foundation for the United States ' unprecedented economic and military power . Today 's U.S. superpower status , in turn , may eventually be eclipsed by countries that harness hydrogen as aggressively as the United States tapped oil a century ago . Countries that focus their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind in the rush for tomorrow 's prize . As Don Huberts , chief executive officer of Shell Hydrogen , has noted : " The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones , and the oil age will not end because we run out of oil . " Access to geographically concentrated petroleum has also influenced world wars , the 1991 Persian Gulf War , and relations between and among Western economies , the Middle East , and the developing world . Shifting to the plentiful , more dispersed hydrogen could alter the power balances among energy-producing and energy-consuming nations , possibly turning today 's importers into tomorrow 's exporters . <p> The most important consequence of a hydrogen economy may be the replacement of the twentieth-century " hydrocarbon society " with something far better . Twentieth-century humans used ten times as much energy as their ancestors had in the thousand years preceding 1900 . This increase was enabled primarily by fossil fuels , which account for 90 percent of energy worldwide . Global energy consumption is projected to rise by close to 60 percent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are projected to increase by approximately 30 and 40 percent , respectively . <p> Most of the future growth in energy is expected to take place in transportation , where motorization continues to rise and where petroleum is the dominant fuel , accounting for 95 percent of the total . Failure to develop alternatives to oil would heighten growing reliance on oil imports , raising the risk of political and military conflict and economic disruption . In industrial nations , the share of imports in overall oil demand would rise from roughly 56 percent today to 72 percent by 2010 . Coal , meanwhile , is projected to maintain its grip on more than half the world 's power supply . Continued rises in coal and oil use would exacerbate urban air problems in industrialized cities that still exceed air pollution health standards and in megacities such as Delhi , Beijing , and Mexico City , which experience thousands of pollution-related deaths each year . And prolonging petroleum and coal reliance in transportation and electricity would increase annual global carbon emissions from 6.1 to 9.8 billion tons by 2020 , accelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coastal flooding , and loss of small islands ; extreme weather events ; reduced agricultural productivity and water availability ; and the loss of biodiversity . <p> Hydrogen can not , on its own , entirely solve each of these complex problems , which are affected not only by fuel supply but also by such factors as population , over- and underconsumption , sprawl , congestion , and vehicle dependence . But hydrogen could provide a major hedge against these risks . By enabling the spread of appliances , more decentralized " micropower " plants , and vehicles based on efficient fuel cells , whose only byproduct is water , hydrogen would dramatically cut emissions of particulates , carbon monoxide , sulfur and nitrogen oxides , and other local air pollutants . By providing a secure and abundant domestic supply of fuel , hydrogen would significantly reduce oil import requirements , providing the energy independence and security that many nations crave . <p> Hydrogen would , in addition , facilitate the transition from limited nonrenewable stocks of fossil fuels to unlimited flows of renewable sources , playing an essential role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to avoid the most severe effects of climate change . According to the World Energy Assessment , released in 2000 by several United Nations agencies and the World Energy Council , which emphasizes " the strategic importance of hydrogen as an energy carrier , " the accelerated replacement of oil and other fossil fuels with hydrogen could help achieve " deep reductions " in carbon emissions and avoid a doubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere -- a level at which scientists expect major , and potentially irreversible , ecological and economic disruptions . Hydrogen fuel cells could also help address global energy inequities -- providing fuel and power and spurring employment and exports in the rural regions of the developing world , where nearly two billion people lack access to modern energy services . <p> Despite these potential benefits , and despite early movement toward a hydrogen economy , its full realization faces an array of technical and economic obstacles . Hydrogen has yet o be piped into the mainstream of the energy policies and strategies of governments and businesses , which tend to aim at preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , and its emphasis on expanding fossil fuel production , serving as the most recent example of this mindset . In the energy sector 's equivalent of U.S. political campaign finance , market structures have long been tilted toward fossil fuel production . Subsidies to these energy sources -- in the form of direct supports and the " external " costs of pollution -- are estimated at roughly $300 billion annually . <p> The perverse signals in today 's energy market , which lead to artificially low fossil fuel prices and encourage the production and use of those fuels , make it difficult for hydrogen and fuel cells -- whose production , delivery , and storage costs are improving but look high under such circumstances -- to compete with the entrenched gasoline-run internal combustion engines and coal-fired power plants . This skewed market could push the broad availability of fuel cell vehicles and power plants a decade or more into the future . Unless the antiquated rules of the energy economy -- aimed at keeping hydrocarbon production cheap by shifting the cost to consumers and the environment -- are reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the most significant obstacles to realizing the full promise of hydrogen is the prevailing perception that a full-fledged hydrogen infrastructure -- the system for producing , storing , and delivering the gas -- would immediately cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build , far more than a system based on liquid fuels such as gasoline or methanol . As a result , auto and energy companies are investing millions of dollars in the development of reformer and vehicle technologies that would derive and use hydrogen from these liquids , keeping the current petroleum-based infrastructure intact . <p> This incremental path -- continuing to rely on the dirtier , less secure fossil fuels as a bridge to the new energy system-represents a costly wrong turn , both financially and environmentally . Should manufacturers " lock in " to mass-producing inferior fuel cell vehicles just as a hydrogen infrastructure approaches viability , trillions of dollars worth of assets could be wasted . Furthermore , by perpetuating petroleum consumption and import dependence and the excess emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases , this route would deprive society of numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from fossil fuels . Over the long run , this proportion needs to be shifted toward renewable sources , not maintained , for hydrogen production to be sustainable . <p> In the past several years , a number of scientists have openly challenged the conventional wisdom of the incremental path . Their research suggests that the direct use of hydrogen is , in fact , the quickest and least costly route -- for the consumer and the environment -- toward a hydrogen infrastructure . Their studies point to an alternative pathway that would initially use the existing infrastructure for natural gas -- the cleanest fossil fuel and the fastest growing in terms of use -- and employ fuel cells in niche applications to bring down their costs to competitive levels , spurring added hydrogen infrastructure investment . As the costs of producing hydrogen from renewable energy fell , meanwhile , hydrogen would evolve into the major source of storage for the limitless but intermittent flows of the sun , wind , tides , and Earth 's heat . The end result would be a clean , natural hydrogen cycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen , with the latter used in fuel cells to produce electricity and water -- which then would be available to repeat the process . <p> There are no major technical obstacles to the alternative path to hydrogen . As one researcher has put it , " If we really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen economy , we could have it by 2010 . " But the political and institutional barriers are formidable . Both government and industry have devoted far more resources to the gasoline- and methanol-based route than to the direct hydrogen path . Hydrogen receives a fraction of the research funding that is allocated to coal , oil , nuclear , and other mature , commercial energy sources . Within energy companies , the hydrocarbon side of the business argues that oil will be dominant for decades to come , even as other divisions prepare for its successors . And very little has been done to educate people about the properties and safety of hydrogen , even though public acceptance -- or lack thereof -- will in the end make or break the hydrogen future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more secure path to hydrogen point to an essential -- and little recognized -- role for government . Indeed , without aggressive energy and environmental policies , the hydrogen economy is likely to emerge along the more incremental path , and at a pace that is inadequate for dealing with the range of challenges posed by the incumbent energy system . Neither market forces nor government flat will , in isolation , move us down the more direct , more difficult route . The challenge is for government to guide the transition , setting the rules of the game and working with industry and society toward the preferable hydrogen future . <p> This catalytic leadership role would be analogous to that played by government in launching another infrastructure in the early years of the Cold War . Recognizing the strategic importance of having its networks of information more decentralized and less vulnerable to attack , the U.S. government engaged in critical research , incentives , and public/private collaboration toward development of what we now call the Internet . An equally , and arguably even more , compelling case can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that best limits vulnerability to air pollution , energy insecurity , and climate change . Investments made today will heavily influence in what manner and how fast the hydrogen economy emerges in coming decades . As with creating the Internet , putting humans on the moon , and other great endeavors , it is the cost of inaction that should most occupy the minds of our leaders now , at the dawn of the hydrogen age . <p> By Seth Dunn <p> <p> Seth Dunn is a research associate at the Worldwatch Institute , where he is a member of the climate/energy team and for which he has written extensively .

##4000975 Physician-assisted suicide is among the most hotly debated bioethical issues of our time . Every reasonable person prefers that no patient ever contemplate suicide-with or without assistance-and recent improvements in pain management have begun to reduce the number of patients seeking such assistance . However , there are some patients who experience terrible suffering that ca n't be relieved by any of the therapeutic or palliative techniques medicine and nursing have to offer , and some of those patients desperately seek deliverance . <p> Physician-assisted suicide is n't about physicians becoming killers . It 's about patients whose suffering we ca n't relieve and about not turning away from them when they ask for help . Will there be physicians who feel they ca n't do this ? Of course , and they should n't be obliged to . But if other physicians consider it merciful to help such patients by merely writing a prescription , it is unreasonable to place them in jeopardy of criminal prosecution , loss of license , or other penalty for doing so . <p> Many arguments are put forward for maintaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweighed by two fundamental principles that support ending the prohibition : patient autonomy-the right to control one 's own body -- and the physician 's duty to relieve suffering . <p> Society recognizes the competent patient 's right to autonomy -- to decide what will or wo n't be done to his or her body . There is almost universal agreement that a competent adult has the right to self-determination , including the right to have life-sustaining treatment withheld or withdrawn . Suicide , once illegal throughout the United States , is no longer illegal in any part of the country . Yet assisting a person to take her or his own life is prohibited in every state but Oregon . If patients seek such help , it is cruel to leave them to fend for themselves , weighing options that are both traumatic and uncertain , when humane assistance could be made available . <p> The physician 's obligations are many but , when cure is impossible and palliation has failed to achieve its objectives , there is always a residual obligation to relieve suffering . Ultimately , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient -- and only the patient -- who can judge whether death is harmful or a good to be sought . Marcia Angell , former executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , has put it this way : <p> The highest ethical imperative of doctors should be to provide care in whatever way best serves patients ' interests , in accord with each patient 's wishes , not with a theoretical commitment to preserve life no matter what the cost in suffering .... The greatest harm we can do is to consign a desperate patient to unbearable suffering -- or force the patient to seek out a stranger like Dr. Kevorkian . <p> Let 's examine the key arguments made against physician-assisted suicide . First , much weight is placed on the Hippocratic injunction to do no harm . It has been asserted that sanctioning physician-assisted suicide " would give doctors a license to kill , " and physicians who accede to such requests have been branded by some as murderers . This is both illogical and inflammatory . Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment -- for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by society , yet this requires a more definitive act by a physician than prescribing a medication that a patient has requested and is free to take or not , as he or she sees fit . Why should the latter be perceived as doing harm when the former is not ? Rather than characterizing this as " killing , " we should see it as bringing the dying process to a merciful end . The physician who complies with a plea for final release from a patient facing death under unbearable conditions is doing good , not harm , and her or his actions are entirely consonant with the Hippocratic tradition . <p> Second , it is argued that requests for assisted suicide come largely from patients who have n't received adequate pain control or who are clinically depressed and have n't been properly diagnosed or treated . There is no question that proper management of such conditions would significantly reduce the number of patients who consider suicide ; any sanctioning of assistance should be contingent upon prior management of pain and depression . <p> However , treatable pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common reason , why patients seek to end their lives . Severe body wasting , intractable vomiting , urinary and bowel incontinence , immobility , and total dependence are recognized as more important than pain in the desire for hastened death . There is a growing awareness that loss of dignity and of those attributes that we associate particularly with being human are the factors that most commonly reduce patients to a state of unrelieved misery and desperation . <p> Third , it is argued that permitting physician-assisted suicide would undermine the sense of trust that patients have in their doctors . This is curious reasoning ; patients are not lying in bed wondering if their physicians are going to kill them -- and permitting assisted suicide should n't create such fears , since the act of administering a fatal dose would be solely within the control of the patient . Rather than undermining a patient 's trust , I would expect the legalization of physician-assisted suicide to enhance that trust . I have spoken with a great many people who feel that they would like to be able to trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelieved suffering -- and making that possible would give such patients a greater sense of security . Furthermore , some patients have taken their own lives at a relatively early stage of terminal illness precisely because they feared that progressively increasing disability , without anyone to assist them , would rob them of this option at a later time when they were truly desperate . A patient contemplating suicide would be much less likely to take such a step if he or she were confident of receiving assistance in the future if so desired . <p> Fourth , it is argued that patients do n't need assistance to commit suicide ; they can manage it all by themselves . This seems both callous and unrealistic . Are patients to shoot themselves , jump from a window , starve themselves to death , or rig a pipe to the car exhaust ? All of these methods have been used by patients in the final stages of desperation , but it is a hideous experience for both patient and survivors . Even patients who ca n't contemplate such traumatic acts and instead manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to complete the process without help and therefore face a high risk of failure , with dreadful consequences for themselves and their families . <p> Fifth , it is argued that requests for assisted suicide are not frequent enough to warrant changing the law . Interestingly , some physicians say they have rarely , if ever , received such requests , while others say they have often received requests . This is a curious discrepancy , but I think it can be explained : the patient who seeks help with suicide will cautiously test a physician 's receptivity to the idea and simply wo n't approach a physician who is unreceptive . Thus , there are two subsets of physicians in this situation : those who are open to the idea of assisted suicide and those who are n't . Patients are likely to seek help from the former but not from the latter . <p> A study carried out a few years ago by the University of Washington School of Medicine queried 828 physicians ( a 25 percent sample of primary care physicians and all physicians in selected medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these respondents , 12 percent reported receiving one or more explicit requests for assisted suicide , and one-fourth of the patients requesting such assistance received prescriptions . <p> A survey of physicians in San Francisco treating AIDS patients brought responses from half , and 53 percent of those respondents reported helping patients take their own lives by prescribing lethal doses of narcotics . Clearly , requests for assisted suicide ca n't be dismissed as rare occurrences . <p> Sixth , it is argued that sanctioning assisted suicide would fail to address the needs of patients who are incompetent . This is obviously true , since proposals for legalization specify that assistance be given only to a patient who is competent and who requests it . However , in essence , this argument says that , because we can t establish a procedure that will deal " with every patient , we wo n't make assisted suicide available to any patient . What logic ! Imagine the outcry if that logic were applied to a procedure such as organ transplantation , which has benefited so many people in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door to physician-assisted suicide we will find ourselves on a slippery slope leading to coercion and involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable patients . Why so ? We have learned to grapple with many slippery slopes in medicine -- such as Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) orders and the withdrawal of life support . We do n't deal with those slippery slopes by prohibition but , rather , by adopting reasonable ground rules and setting appropriate limits . <p> The slippery slope argument discounts the real harm of failing to respond to the pleas of real people and considers only the potential harm that might be done to others at some future time and place . As in the case of other slippery slopes , theoretical future harm can be mitigated by establishing appropriate criteria that would have to be met before a patient could receive assistance . Such criteria have been outlined frequently . Stated briefly , they include : The patient must have an incurable condition causing severe , unrelenting suffering . The patient must understand his or her condition and prognosis , which must be verified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been presented to and considered by the patient . The patient must clearly and repeatedly request assistance in dying . A psychiatric consultation must be held to establish if the patient is suffering from a treatable depression . The prescribing physician , absent a close preexisting relationship ( which would be ideal ) , must get to know the patient well enough to understand the reasons for her or his request . No physician should be expected to violate his or her own basic values . A physician who is unwilling to assist the patient should facilitate transfer to another physician who would be prepared to do so . All of the foregoing must be clearly documented . <p> Application of the above criteria would substantially reduce the risk of abuse but could n't guarantee that abuse would never occur . We must recognize , however , that abuses occur today -- in part because we tolerate covert action that is subject to no safeguards at all . A more open process would , in the words of philosopher and ethicist Margaret Battin , " prod us to develop much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already make in what are often quite casual , cavalier ways . " <p> It seems improbable that assisted suicide would pose a special danger to the elderly , infirm , and disabled . To paraphrase John Maynard Keynes , in the long run we are all elderly , infirm , or disabled and , since society well knows this , serious attention would surely be given to adequate protections against abuse . It is n't my intention to dispose glibly of the fear that society would view vulnerable patients as a liability and would manipulate them to end their lives prematurely . Of course , this concern must be respected , but the risk can be minimized by applying the criteria listed above . Furthermore , this argument assumes that termination of life is invariably an evil against which we must protect vulnerable patients who are poor or otherwise lacking in societal support . But , by definition , we are speaking of patients who desperately wish final release from unrelieved suffering , and poor and vulnerable patients are least able to secure aid in dying if they want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good luck , find a physician who is willing to provide covert help ; the poor and disenfranchised rarely have access to such assistance in today 's world . <p> Eighth , it is argued that the Netherlands experience proves that societal tolerance of physician-assisted suicide leads to serious abuse . Aside from the fact that the data are subject to varying interpretation depending upon which analysis one believes , the situation in the Netherlands holds few lessons for us , because for many years that country followed the ambiguous practice of technically prohibiting but tacitly permitting assisted suicide and euthanasia . <p> The climate in the United States is different ; our regulatory mechanisms would be different -- much stricter , of course -- and we should expect different outcomes . The experience of Oregon -- the only one of our fifty states to permit physician-assisted suicide-is instructive . During the first three years that Oregon 's law has been in effect , seventy terminally ill patients took advantage of the opportunity to self-administer medication to end protracted dying . Despite dire warnings , there was no precipitous rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uninsured were n't victimized ; almost all of these seventy patients had health insurance , most were on hospice care , and most were people with at least some college education . There were no untoward complications . The Oregon experience is far more relevant for the United States than the Dutch experience , and it vindicates those who , despite extremely vocal opposition , advocated for the legislation . <p> Ninth , it has been argued that a society that does n't assure all its citizens the right to basic health care and protect them against catastrophic health costs has no business considering physician-assisted suicide . I find this an astonishing argument . It says to every patient who seeks ultimate relief from severe suffering that his or her case wo n't be considered until all of us are assured basic health care and financial protection . These are certainly proper goals for any decent society , but they wo n't be attained in the United States until it becomes a more generous and responsible nation -- and that day seems to be far off . Patients seeking deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future developments that are not even visible on the distant horizon . <p> Finally , it is argued that the status quo is acceptable -- that a patient who is determined to end his or her life can find a sympathetic physician who will provide the necessary prescription and that physicians are virtually never prosecuted for such acts . There are at least four reasons to reject the status quo . First , it forces patients and physicians to undertake a clandestine conspiracy to violate the law , thus compromising the integrity of patient , physician , and family . Second , such secret compacts , by their very nature , are subject to faulty implementation with a high risk of failure and consequent tragedy for both patient and family . Third , the assumption that a determined patient can find a sympathetic physician applies , at best , to middle- and upper-income persons who have ongoing relationships with their physicians ; the poor , as I 've already noted , rarely have such an opportunity . Fourth , covert action places a physician in danger of criminal prosecution or loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unlikely , that risk certainly inhibits some physicians from doing what they believe is proper to help their patients . <p> I believe that removing the prohibition against physician assistance , rather than opening the flood gates to ill-advised suicides , is likely to reduce the incentive for suicide : patients who fear great suffering in the final stages of illness would have the assurance that help would be available if needed and they would be more inclined to test their own abilities to withstand the trials that lie ahead . <p> Life is the most precious gift of all , and no sane person wants to part with it , but there are some circumstances where life has lost its value . A competent person who has thoughtfully considered his or her own situation and finds that unrelieved suffering outweighs the value of continued life should n't have to starve to death or find other drastic and violent solutions when more merciful means exist . Those physicians who wish to fulfill what they perceive to be their humane responsibilities to their patients should n't be forced by legislative prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these very sensitive problems . However , I believe that reasonable protections can be put in place that will minimize the risk of abuse and that the humanitarian benefits of legalizing physician-assisted suicide outweigh that risk . All physicians are bound by the injunction to do no harm , but we must recognize that harm may result not only from the commission of a wrongful act but also from the omission of an act of mercy . While not every physician will feel comfortable offering help in these tragic situations , many believe it is right to do so and our society should not criminalize such humanitarian acts . <p> By Peter Rogatz <p> <p> Peter Rogatz , M.D. , M.

##4001269 ABSTRACT . The authors performed 2 experiments investigating the influence of the belief that a vehicle crashed on witnesses ' estimates of the vehicle 's speed . In Experiment 1 , participants saw a video of a civilian car being driven , after which they were assigned to 1 of 2 conditions . The 1st group was told that the vehicle subsequently crashed ; the 2nd group was not told that the vehicle crashed . The results indicted no differences between the 2 groups on a number of factors , including estimates of the vehicle 's speed . Experiment 2 was identical except that the video showed a police car using flashing lights and sirens . Participants who had been told that the car had crashed overestimated speed , the likelihood of a crash , and the likelihood of someone being killed . Participants who were not told that the vehicle crashed estimated the speed of the vehicle accurately . Confidence in their estimates of speed was not significantly different between the 2 groups . Results are discussed with regard to police investigations of road accidents . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police , speed , witness <p> THE POLICE MUST INVESTIGATE vehicle accidents and , if necessary , initiate prosecutions against drivers who have caused crashes . In such investigations the police are typically interested in determining the speed of a vehicle . The reason for this is that speed is one of the most important causes of car crashes . Shibata and Fukuda ( 1994 ) analyzed the data from 33,821 traffic accidents for various risk factors , including driving without a license , consumption of alcohol , speed , and the use of a seat-belt . Speed was the most important risk factor for fatalities . <p> The police rely on a number of sources , such as skid marks and the location and extent of damage to a vehicle , to determine the speed of a vehicle that has been involved in a collision . However , in the majority of cases the most important source of evidence is an eyewitness ( see Kebbell &; Milne , 1998 ) . Therefore , it is important for the police to know how much reliance they can place on eyewitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that witnesses can be reasonably good . For example , a recent study involved mock-eyewitness estimates of the speed of civilian and police cars . Witnesses were remarkably accurate , typically estimating less than 3 miles per hour ( 5 kmph ) above or below the actual speed of the vehicle ( Barnecutt , Pfeffer , &; Creswell , 1999 ; Froyland , Ainsworth , &; Pfeifer , 1998 ; Marshall , 1966 ; Semb , 1969 ) . <p> Nevertheless , in real police investigations witnesses may fare less well . An extensive body of research shows that eyewitness memory is susceptible to distortion . The reconstructive nature of memory means that post-event information may be incorporated into memory and witnesses can be confident in inaccurate information ( Ayers &; Reder , 1998 ; Smith , Kassin , &; Ellsworth , 1989 ) . This possibility is illustrated in a study by Loftus and Palmer ( 1974 ) in which participants were shown a film of a car accident . Later they were asked , " About how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smashed " with one of the following words : " collided , " " bumped , " " hit , " or " contacted . " Although the words all refer to the coming together of two objects , they differ in what they imply about the speed and force of impact . <p> Participants who received the " smashed " version estimated the speed at 40.8 mph ( 65.7 kmph ) , whereas those given the " contacted " version estimated the speed at 30.8 mph ( 49.6 kmph ) . Furthermore , participants who received the " smashed " version were more likely to answer yes to the question " Did you see any broken glass ? " even though there was no broken glass . In fact , leading questions can have an influence even if they are very subtle . Loftus and Zanni ( 1975 ) found that even a change in the wording of the question from " the " to " a " increased the proportion of witnesses who were misled ( e.g. , " Did you see a broken headlight ? " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fortunately , the use of leading questions can be minimized , and many police officers are trained to interview eyewitnesses in a manner that reduces the use of such questions ( Kebbell , Milne , &; Wagstaff , 1999 ) . Nevertheless , a witness 's account may be biased by suggestive post-event sources of information that are not introduced by a police officer . In most instances , when a witness is interviewed concerning a vehicle , it is because that vehicle has been involved in some sort of collision . The very fact that a witness knows that the vehicle has crashed may encourage the witness to attribute the crash to the speed of the vehicle , and this may cause the witness to overestimate the speed of the vehicle prior to the crash . <p> Also , the fact that a vehicle has been involved in a crash may alter eyewitness beliefs about the way that the vehicle was driven . Although speed can be a major factor in causing crashes , other explanations are possible and for some , the driver is not responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side street without seeing an oncoming vehicle . Research by Hendricks et al . ( 2001 ) into 723 crashes involving 1,284 vehicles suggested that 15.1% were caused by such errors . <p> Alternatively , mechanical failures such as a tire blowout or brake failure appear to be responsible in 4% to 13% of cases ( Treat et al. , 1979 ) . Consequently , in this study , we wanted to determine whether the belief that a vehicle crashed would influence eyewitnesses ' estimates about how well that vehicle was driven . The implication is that drivers who were driving perfectly safely may be falsely remembered as driving dangerously simply because they were subsequently involved in a crash . EXPERIMENT 1 <p> To address the idea that knowledge that a vehicle crashed may potentially influence witnesses ' estimates of speed and the dangerousness with which a vehicle was driven , we conducted an experiment to manipulate the knowledge that a vehicle crashed . We hypothesized that witnesses who believed that a vehicle had crashed would estimate the speed of the vehicle to be higher than those who did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that witnesses who believed that the vehicle had crashed would remember the way the vehicle was driven as being more dangerous . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were 33 prospective undergraduate students ( 8 men and 25 women ) . The average age of participants was 22.45 years ( range 17-56 , SD = <p> 11.30 ) . <p> Materials <p> A 1-min video was shot from a stationary position at the side of a street to produce plausible security camera footage . The beginning of the film showed the street and then a car being driven down the street at a constant 49.7 mph ( 80.0 kmph ) toward and then past the camera . We obtained from police files photographs of a crashed car and a not-crashed car identical to the one in the video in terms of color , make , and model . The crashed vehicle had sustained heavy frontal damage consistent with hitting another vehicle . <p> Procedure <p> We tested the participants in groups of up to 6 . Upon arrival they were seated at a distance of approximately 2 m from a 21-in. television/video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about to see was filmed by a security camera . Please watch carefully . " The participants were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions . <p> Car not crashed . In this condition we asked participants to watch the film , after which they were shown photographs of a " not-crashed vehicle . " We then asked them to read an unrelated magazine article as a filler task for 5 min before completing a questionnaire . The questionnaire required that they estimate the speed of the vehicle and provide a confidence judgment of the accuracy of their estimate . We asked them to rate their confidence judgments on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from pure guess ( 1 ) to absolutely certain ( 10 ) . We asked them " How dangerous was the way that the vehicle was being driven ? " Responses were given on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from not at all dangerous ( 1 ) to extremely dangerous ( 10 ) . We asked them " How likely was a crash ? " and " How likely was the driver to kill someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale ranging from not at all likely ( 1 ) to extremely likely ( 10 ) . We then showed the participants pictures of a not-crashed vehicle and told them that this was what the car looked like after it came to a halt . <p> Car crashed . This condition was identical to the not-crashed condition with the exception that after watching the film we told participants , " Immediately after this video was taken this vehicle was involved in a crash . Here are some pictures of the vehicle after the crash . " We then showed them pictures of the crashed vehicle and told them that this was what the car looked like after it came to a halt . <p> After taking part in this experiment , all participants were debriefed . Results <p> Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for mock witnesses ' estimates of the speed at which the vehicle was traveling and their perceptions of how dangerously it was being driven . A t test revealed no significant difference between conditions in mock witnesses ' estimates of speed , t(31) = 0.33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vehicle , t ( 15 ) = 4.10 , p < .01 , and t ( 16 ) = 2.82 , p < .05 , respectively . <p> We found no significant differences between the two conditions in the confidence with which they reported the accuracy of their estimate of the vehicle 's speed , t(31) = 0.19 , ns . Similarly , we found no significant differences between the two conditions on ratings of " How dangerous was the way that the vehicle was being driven ? " t(30) = 0.41 , ns , " How likely was a crash ? " t(31) = 0.87 , ns , and " How likely was the driver to kill someone ? " t(31) = 0.69 , ns . Discussion <p> The results of this experiment contradicted our hypothesis that a belief that a vehicle crashed would increase witnesses ' perceptions of a vehicle 's speed . In fact , the results showed that participants in both conditions significantly underestimated the speed of the vehicle . The results also demonstrated that knowledge concerning the outcome of an event need not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being driven . In this case , participants who believed that the car had subsequently crashed rated the vehicle as being driven as safely as participants who believed that the car had not been involved in an accident . We return to these issues in the general discussion . <p> However , these findings do not necessarily mean that knowledge that a vehicle crashed has no influence on eyewitness estimates . For instance , anecdotal evidence from police accident investigators suggests that witnesses grossly overestimate the speeds of police vehicles when flashing lights and sirens are used and a crash occurs . This seems plausible because , in most instances in real life or in films and television , flashing lights and wailing sirens are used when a vehicle is traveling at high speed . Consequently , the fact that flashing lights and sirens are so firmly associated with vehicles traveling at high speed , combined with the belief that a vehicle crashed , may cause eyewitnesses to overestimate a crashed vehicle 's speed and rate more negatively the way the vehicle was driven ( Ayers &; Reder , 1998 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine whether the belief that a police vehicle crashed while using flashing lights and sirens increases mock witnesses ' speed estimates . The object of this experiment was to manipulate the knowledge that a police vehicle crashed . We hypothesized that witnesses who believed the police vehicle had crashed would perceive the speed of that vehicle and other estimates of dangerousness to be higher than those who did not believe the vehicle had crashed . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were 41 prospective undergraduate students ( 6 men and 35 women ) whose average age was 26.37 ( range 17-69 , SD = 15.09 ) . <p> Materials <p> We constructed a video identical to the previous one except that the vehicle used was a police model of the civilian vehicle and was shown with lights flashing and sirens sounding . Again , it was driven at a constant 49.7 mph ( 80.0 kph ) . We obtained from police files a photograph of a crashed car and a not-crashed car identical to the one shown in the video in terms of make , model , and color . For consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs in both experiments . The crashed vehicle was in fact a police car ; however , in Experiment 1 the photographs were processed using Adobe Photoshop to remove all visible police markings . Thus , the damage to the police vehicle ( Experiment 2 ) and civilian vehicle ( Experiment 1 ) in the crashed conditions was identical , eliminating a potential confound between experiments . <p> Procedure <p> We used the same method as in the previous study with the exception that the vehicle used in the film was a marked police car with flashing lights and sirens . Thus , in one condition ( police car not crashed ) , participants watched a film in which a police car with flashing lights and a siren drove down a street . They were then shown a picture of a police car not crashed . In the second condition ( police car crashed ) participants watched the same video but were subsequently shown a picture of a crashed police vehicle . Results <p> Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations for mock-witness estimates of vehicle speed . Participants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the not-crashed condition , t(39) = 2.89 , p < .01 . Also , whereas participants in the not-crashed group were , on average , very accurate in estimating the speed of the vehicle , t ( 16 ) = 0.41 , ns , the crashed group significantly overestimated the speed of the vehicle , t(23) = 4.58 , p < .001 . However , despite the fact that there were clear differences in the accuracy of their speed estimates , no significant differences were found between the two conditions for witness confidence in the accuracy of these estimates , t(39) = 0.55 , ns . <p> Considering participants ' perceptions of how dangerously the police vehicle was being driven , those in the crashed condition did not rate the vehicle as being driven more dangerously than those in the not-crashed condition , t(39) = 1.46 , ns . However , drivers were rated as being significantly " more likely " to crash , t(39) = 4.09 , p < .001 , and significantly " more likely to kill someone " by those in the crashed condition than by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ < .001 . Discussion <p> In this experiment , the belief that a police vehicle with flashing lights and sirens had crashed caused witnesses in the crashed condition to overestimate the vehicle 's speed , estimating the vehicle to be traveling significantly faster than participants in the not-crashed condition did . Whereas participants in the not-crashed condition of this experiment were accurate in their estimations of the speed of the police vehicle , those in the crashed condition significantly overestimated the speed of the car . Nevertheless , those in the crashed condition were just as confident in the accuracy of their estimate as those in the not-crashed condition . In addition , participants in the crashed condition of this experiment reported that they thought the car was more likely to be involved in a crash and to cause a fatality than did participants in the not-crashed condition . GENERAL DISCUSSION <p> The results of the two experiments were mixed . The hypothesized effect of knowledge that a vehicle crashed causes witnesses to overestimate vehicle speed was not supported in Experiment 1 . This result suggests that for accidents involving civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle simply because they know it crashed . However , we found a significant effect in Experiment 2 . The obvious , and only , difference between the two experiments is that in Experiment 2 we used a police vehicle with flashing lights and sirens . One possible explanation of this result may be that witnesses in the crashed police car condition are aware that police drivers are highly trained and therefore unlikely to crash under normal conditions . Given this knowledge , mock witnesses may have reasoned that for a highly trained police driver to crash he or she must have been traveling at high speed . <p> Alternatively , or additionally , because witnesses are likely to associate police lights and sirens with high-speed pursuits , they may overestimate speed . Thus , the overestimate of speed is explicable within an activation-based framework in terms of source of activation confusion ( Anderson &; Bower , 1973 ; Reder &; Schunn , 1996 ) . The concept of " high speed " is activated by the knowledge that a vehicle crashed and the use of flashing lights and sirens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle , the activation of this concept influences their memory for the speed of the vehicle and they give high estimates . Unfortunately , this is likely to be an unconscious process and witnesses can be unaware that this has occurred ( Kelley &; Jacoby , 1996 ) . <p> This latter point is supported by the confidence judgments . In the crashed police car condition , whereas mock witnesses significantly overestimated the speed of the police vehicle , they were no less confident in this condition than in the uncrashed police vehicle condition . This is an important finding because confidence is often used to infer accuracy ( Fox &; Walters , 1986 ; Leippe , Manion , &; Romanczyk , 1992 ) . For instance a witness who says , " I 'm absolutely certain the car was doing 100 miles per hour " is more likely to be believed that one who says , " I thought the car was doing 60 miles an hour but I 'm not sure . " The practical implication of this finding is that confidence in the speed of a vehicle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a number of witnesses provide estimates of a vehicle 's speed , an investigator should be careful about simply relying on the most confident witness . <p> Returning to the issue of speed estimates , mock witnesses in both conditions of Experiment 1 underestimated the speed of the civilian vehicle , whereas those in the uncrashed condition in Experiment 2 , with the police car using lights and sirens , were accurate , and the witnesses in the crashed condition overestimated the speed of the vehicle . Although accuracy was not the focus of this experiment and the fact that the stimuli was presented via videotape rather than witnessed in real life reduces our ability to generalize , these findings suggest that witnesses ' speed estimates can be influenced by factors other than the actual speed of the vehicle , can vary greatly , and should be treated with caution . <p> In Experiment 1 no difference was found between " How likely was a crash ? " and " How likely was the driver to kill someone ? " The absence of significant effects in Experiment 1 shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crash and likely to kill someone because they believed the vehicle did crash later . However , in Experiment 2 significant differences were found between the two conditions . Participants in the crashed condition rated the driver as being more likely to crash and more likely to kill someone . This shows that witnesses ' reports concerning the way a vehicle was driven can be influenced by flashing lights and sirens and the belief that a vehicle crashed . Again , reasons for these reports are likely to be source of activation confusion . <p> Nevertheless , no significant effect was found between the crashed and uncrashed conditions concerning remembered dangerousness . Even flashing lights and sirens and belief that a vehicle crashed did not cause remembered dangerousness to increase . However , in our film the vehicle is simply driven down a straight road at a constant speed . Perhaps if the vehicle had been driven in a more ambiguous manner , for instance , if the vehicle had to swerve to avoid a pedestrian , then witnesses ' estimates of the perceived dangerousness of the way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the potential for considerable future work . Research into the use of heuristics in recall is relevant here . This work shows heuristics are particularly likely to be invoked when ( a ) there is little time to engage in systematic analysis , ( b ) individuals are overloaded with information , and/or ( c ) there is little available information ( Macrae , Hewstone , &; Griffiths , 1993 ) . Potentially , police cars with flashing lights at night are more likely to command attention , and other cues are unavailable to determine speed . Hence , the distortions we have found here with police vehicles may be exacerbated by nightfall . <p> Similarly , eyewitnesses ' memory of the driving of vehicles other than police vehicles may be influenced by reconstructive memory processes and a belief that the vehicle crashed . For instance , many people have stereotypes concerning the driving of New York taxis that may mean blame is more likely to be attributed to the taxi driver in the event of a crash than to another driver involved in the crash . These issues demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown that belief that a vehicle crashed has no influence on witnesses ' reports of the way a civilian car is driven , but when a police car with flashing lights and sirens is supposedly involved in a crash , witnesses are likely to overestimate the speed , the likelihood of someone being killed , and the likelihood of a crash . The implication is that anecdotal reports from police officers who have been involved in accidents when they had lights and sirens on may well be correct . The lights and sirens and knowledge that a crash occurred may lead witnesses to overestimate speed . Of course , it should be kept in mind that in real cases police officers may minimize their speed to prevent disciplinary measures . Nevertheless , these results suggest that witnesses ' descriptions of crashes involving police vehicles using flashing lights and sirens should be treated with caution . <p> The authors thank the British Academy for the award of a postdoctoral fellowship to the first author that partly supported this work .

##4001270 ABSTRACT . Longing can be defined as a blend of the primary emotions of happiness and sadness . These primary emotions are experienced very early by children , and the meanings of the words happiness and sadness are also known by children early in their verbal development . To find out at what age children are able to understand and use the more developed concept of longing , the authors interviewed 74 preschoolers ( 4- and 5-year-olds ) in Norway and Sweden about their experiences of longing . Chi-square analyses showed age and sex differences in knowledge of the concept , and some differences between categories of longing were also significant . Results showed that young children 's ability to understand and use the concept of longing appears to be limited and that girls seem to mature earlier in this respect than boys do . <p> Key words : children , emotional development , emotions , longing <p> LONGING has usually been defined as a blend or a mix of the primary emotions of love and sadness , and it is also considered an emotion of second-or higher-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1999 ) . It is also an emotion with a character of its own . In a study of emotion families , Shaver , Schwartz , Kirson , and O'Connor ( 1987 ) found longing to be the only emotion in one of the subclusters . The experiencing of mixed or opposite emotions comes relatively late in a child 's development . By the age of 9 , children acknowledge that one situation can provoke two opposite emotions , whereas younger children usually do not admit that more than one emotion at a time can be experienced ( Harris , 1993 ; Whitesell &; Harter , 1989 ) . <p> Age effects in training children to acknowledge mixed emotions were reported by Peng , Johnson , Pollock , and Glasspool ( 1992 ) , and 6- to 7-year-olds were found to benefit more from such training than 4- to 5-year-olds . Holm , Classon , Greaker , Karlsson , and Strmberg ( 2000 ) found that 6-year-old children have experienced several dimensions of longing . Because 4- and 5-year-olds can use the word longing , we wanted to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the development of longing as a mixed emotion . In this study we wanted to discover whether 4- and 5-year-old children can understand , use , and describe the concept of longing and relate it to their own experiences . In studies of children 's experiences of the concept of longing , the term love has been replaced by the more appropriate term happiness ( Holm , 2001 ; Holm et al. , 2000 ) , and that is also the case in this study . Method <p> Participants and Procedure <p> Do 4- and 5-year-old children know what longing is ? Have they experienced it themselves ? How do they feel when they are longing ? What do they do ? Are they longing for something when they are at home ? In preschool ? Do they talk about their longing with someone ? These were questions that we asked 74 Norwegian and Swedish 4- and 5-year-old preschoolers in an attempt to find out if and how children in these age groups experience this particular emotion . Twenty-two Norwegian children ( 15 girls and 7 boys ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interviewed individually during ordinary days at their preschools . Thirty-one of the children were 4 years old , and 43 were 5 years old . <p> Thirty-two children listened to a story about a boy who was longing for his playmate ( a girl ) and talked a little about the story before the interview questions were posed ; 22 listened to the story afterwards ; and the story was not read at all to 20 of them . The interviews were written out and analyzed by all three authors , independent of each other , before the results were summarized . Results and Discussion <p> No effect of the story conditions " before " versus " after " versus " no story " were found . No nationality differences were found in any of the answers . Some children did not answer all the questions , and some answers had nothing to do with the question posed . The reasons for not answering all questions were mostly lack of interest ( wanting to go back to some activity ) or lack of understanding . <p> To find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing , we posed the question " Do you know what longing is ? " The answer was no from 38 children and yes from 28 . Twenty of these latter children said that it is longing for someone . An age and sex difference could be seen , namely , that the yes answers came from the 5-year-old girls from both countries in all but 5 cases . A chi-square analysis of the yes and no answers from the 5-year-old girls versus the rest of the sample , ? ( 1 , N = 66 ) = 22.05 , p < .001 , showed that the 5-year-old girls ' answers differed significantly from those of the rest of the children who answered the question . <p> This result might be expected because girls often are verbally and emotionally more mature than boys ( Brody &; Hall , 1993 ) . Girls may be more observant of their own feelings , something that can be seen in results regarding sex differences in homesickness ( Zimmerman &; Bijur , 1995 ) . Some age differences in the depth of understanding of emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Garrattoni , and Venturini ( 2000 ) and by Lagattuta , Wellman , and Flavell ( 1997 ) . <p> Sixteen of the children answered no to the question " Have you ever been longing ? " All of the remaining 58 who answered yes also told the interviewers what they had been longing for . Earlier research has shown that children usually describe emotional states by describing what induces it ( Cartron-Guerin &; Reveillaut , 1980 ) . Twenty-seven had been longing for family members , 8 for playmates , 11 for things , 7 for occasions , and 5 for animals . Of the whole sample , 47% had been longing for persons and 31% for nonpersons . <p> A chi-square analysis of differences among the five different categories of longing showed that longing for family members was significantly more common than longing for something else , ? ( 4 , N = 58 ) = 27.16 , p < .001 . The pattern for yes and no answers on this question was different from the answers to the first question . Most children obviously had been longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what longing was . <p> " How do you feel when you are longing ? " was answered with " I do n't know " by 21 of the children . Another 21 mentioned something negative like " not good , " " a little sad , " " no fun , " and " dreary . " Twelve mentioned something positive like " good " and " happy . " The difference between these groups was not significant . Five children had experienced both positive and negative feelings ( e.g. , " I am a little happy in the beginning , but then I become sad " and " When I am longing for my uncle I am happy , but not when I am homesick " ) . <p> On follow-up questions , 13 children answered that longing could be both happy and sad . Ten of them were girls ; 8 were 5-year-olds and 2 were 4-year-olds . This indicates an age-and sex-dependent growing awareness of the dual nature of longing ( see , e.g. , Holm , 1999 ) . Thirty-seven children ( half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sad , one neutral , and one happy -- to help them decide what longing feels like . Fifteen children chose the happy face , and 15 chose the sad face . Seven chose the neutral face . Three children pointed to two or three faces , and they were excluded from the analysis . The age and sex differences among the three groups -- happy , sad , and neutral -- were not significant . <p> The answers to the question " What do you do when you are longing ? " showed that 38 children were active , most of them playing . Only 5 were passive , just waiting and doing nothing . Nine did not know or did not answer . A chi-square analysis showed that the difference among the groups was significant , ? ( 2 , N = 52 ) = 37.42 , p < .001 . Activity as a means of distraction from the emotion of homesickness has been reported by Thurber and Weisz ( 1997 ) and as a distraction from the emotion of longing by Holm et al . ( 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you longing for something when you are at home ? " Six were longing for parents and relatives , 9 for playmates , 9 for playing and toys , 2 for animals , whereas 15 of then said " Nothing " or " I do n't know . " The difference was significant , ? ( 4 , N = 41 ) = 11.08 , p < .05 . In answer to the question " Are you longing for something when you are at preschool ? " 6 children said they longed for parents and relatives , 7 longed for playmates , 4 wanted to play , 5 longed for home , and 17 responded that they longed for nothing or said " do n't know . " The difference was significant , ? ( 4 , N = 39 ) = 14.21 , p < .01 . A relatively large proportion of the children did not seem to be longing in these contexts or were not aware of such feelings . <p> Twenty-six children were also asked , " Do you talk to someone when you are longing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 7 said playmates ; 6 said brothers , sisters , and relatives ; 1 said my pet and myself ; 2 children did not know . Almost all the children talked to some person , and there was a significant difference among the categories , ?

The levels of verbal , cognitive , and emotional development in these age groups make the proportion of potential candidates for direct interviewing limited . Several of the children in this study answered only a few of the planned questions , and that limited the value of the statistical analyses . Perhaps interviews that take place in some other context than in the preschool may extract more answers and yield better results . <p> We did not find any differences between the countries , probably because these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countries that differ considerably may show other results ( e.g. , Jolley , Zhi , &; Thomas , 1998 ) . We did find an age-and sex-related result . The girls ' answers often were longer than the answers given by the boys . A comparison of the answers to the first two questions indicated that most children have experienced longing , but not all children seem to be able to use the concept or describe it verbally . <p> Part of this research was made possible by a grant from the research program The Reflecting Citizen , School of Education and Communication , Jnkping University . <p> Address correspondence to Olle Holm , School of Education and Communication , Jnkping University , Box 1026 , 551 11 Jnkping , Sweden ; olle.holm@hlk.hj.se ( e-mail ) . <p> 
##4001273 ABSTRACT . The authors examined how patriarchy , sexism , and gender influence Turkish college students ' attitudes toward women managers . Turkish undergraduate students ( N = 183 ) from Middle East Technical University completed questionnaires measuring attitudes toward women managers as well as attitudes toward the concepts of hostile and benevolent sexism and support for patriarchy . Participants were of upper-or middle-class Turkish backgrounds . The results showed that male participants exhibited less positive attitudes toward women managers than did female participants . In addition , participants who held more favorable attitudes toward patriarchy and who scored high on hostile sexism also held less positive attitudes toward women managers than those who held less favorable attitudes toward patriarchy and who scored low on hostile sexism . A regression analysis showed that support for patriarchy and hostile sexism was more important for explaining less favorable attitudes toward women managers than was benevolent sexism . <p> Key words : attitudes , benevolent sexism , gender differences , gender stereotypes , hostile sexism , patriarchy , women managers <p> PERCEPTIONS OF AND ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN as managers have received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubno , 1985 ; Schein , 1975 ) and in other countries such as Nigeria ( Adeyemi-Bello &; Tomkiewicz , 1996 ) . Our purpose in the present study was to explore the issues of attitudes toward women in top managerial positions in Turkey . We examined how gender differences , patriachy , and hostile and benevolent sexism influence attitudes toward women managers in a sample of Turkish college students . <p> Gender stereotypes are responsible for workplace discrimination and for negative attitudes toward women as managers ( Eagly &; Mladinic , 1994 ; Heilman , 1995 ) . According to traditional Turkish gender roles , men are dominant , independent , competitive , and capable of leadership , and women are submissive , dependent , caring , and good at domestic tasks and child rearing ( Geis , 1993 ) . Gender stereotypes in a society are often responsible for prejudice and discrimination against women . Thus , the idea of patriarchy , which refers to a structural control by men over political , legal , economic , and religious institutions ( Goldberg , 1993 , cited in Glick &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to behave in a discriminatory manner toward women in many areas of their lives . Johnson ( 1995 ) even suggested that the product of the patriarchal traditions of men 's right to control their women can be called patriarchal terrorism and involves systematic violence , economic subordination , threats , and other control tactics . <p> Sexism , an important social-psychological concept relevant to patriarchy , is created by patriarchy and may be an important factor in the exclusion of women from the workplace . Sexism is a negative attitude or discriminatory behavior based on the presumed inferiority or difference of women as a group ( Cameron , 1977 ) . As social psychologists argued , persistent sexism and patriarchy encourage a belief in the superiority of men and promote the idea that men deserve to control and receive more resources than women control or receive . In patriarchal and sexist cultures , the women are assigned to domestic roles , whereas the men are associated with career , authority , and leadership ( Eagly &; Mladinic , 1994 ) . <p> Glick and Fiske ( 1997 ) argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a product of the patriarchal tradition combined with men 's dependence on women for sexual reproduction . Modern sexists might reject any sort of discrimination toward women , but they might have ambivalent affection for women . A woman can be seen as a saint or a strumpet . These two views create ambivalent sexism , termed hostile and benevolent sexism . <p> Glick and Fiske ( 1996 ) defined hostile sexism as traditional prejudicial attitudes toward women ( e.g. , anger , resentment , antipathy ) , characterizing women as inferior , and justifying male power and traditional gender roles . Hostile sexism can be accepted as a subtle way of measuring support for male dominance , competitive gender differentiation ( devaluing women ) , and hostile sexuality ( e.g. , anger at women for using sexual attraction to manipulate men ) . <p> Benevolent sexism " is a set of interrelated attitudes toward women that are sexist in terms of viewing women stereotypically and in restricted roles but that are subjectively positive in tone and also tend to elicit behaviors typically categorized as pro-social or intimacy-seeking " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protective paternalism ( protecting or helping women ) , complementary gender differentiation ( favoring women ) , and heterosexual intimacy ( feelings of personal need , intense affection for and admiration of women ) are the three underlying sources of benevolent sexism . A cross-cultural study on hostile and benevolent sexism in 19 nations by Glick et al . ( 2000 ) showed that in the countries that were highest in sexism ( Cuba , Nigeria , Turkey ) , individuals tended to reject hostile sexism but were less likely to reject benevolent sexism , whereas in countries that were more egalitarian ( England , Australia , the United States ) , individuals tended to reject both hostile and benevolent sexism . <p> In short , hostile and benevolent sexism might influence individuals ' attitudes toward women managers differently in Turkey . Glick , Dibold , Bailey-Werner , and Zhu ( 1997 ) found that men 's hostile sexism scores were correlated with negative evaluations of career-oriented women , whereas benevolent sexism scores correlated with favorable evaluations of homemakers . <p> Patriarchy , Sexism , and Women Managers in Turkey <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role differences . The institutions of marriage and the family are highly patriarchal ( Kandiyoti , 1995 ) . Men are the dominant sex and are expected to control the home . The husband is culturally accepted as the ruler of the family and is regarded as the formal authority to whom the wife and children must ultimately respond . The husband 's role is authoritarian , and he assumes responsibility for maintaining the family structure by whatever means he feels are justified . The wife 's role is taking care of the family and remaining dependent on her husband to protect the family structure . In short , the Turkish people still generally value patriarchy ( e.g. , Kagitibasi , 1981 ) . <p> Sakalli ( 2002 ) demonstrated that sexism was an important factor in understanding prejudiced attitudes toward stigmatized groups , suggesting that sexist Turkish individuals were more likely to hold negative attitudes toward stigmatized groups such as homosexuals . In terms of an ambivalent sexism model , Sakalli showed that the concept of hostile sexism was an especially important influence on negative attitudes held toward stigmatized groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in paid jobs since the 1950s ( zbay , 1995 ) , but their jobs have been mainly in the areas of education , health , and secretarial work , relevant to the gender role stereotype . Women also have had opportunities to work in middle and top managerial positions . According to the General Department of Women 's Status and Problems ( 1996 ) , the percentages of middle to top management positions , respectively , held by women were 80% for a chief position , 15% for a division director position , 3.7% for a department head , and 0.12% for a general director position . Kabasakal , Bocacigiller , and Erden ( 1994 ) found that the percentage of women employees in 64 organizations was 43% , with 26% in middle management and 3% in top management . Overall , consistent with other countries , all these numbers suggest that Turkish men are still seen as " first choice " for managerial positions . <p> There have been some studies on perceptions of women managers in Turkey . ifti ( 1979 , cited in General Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish men were seen as more devoted to their work , more reliable , more precise , and harder working than women managers . Women employees were seen as more compliant than were men employees . Some research in Turkey has shown that women 's lower representation in managerial positions has resulted from the definition of work based on gender , the organizational culture that has created a barrier for women 's advancement in their career ( Atabek , 1994 ) , and patriarchal stereotypes ( Berberoglu &; Mavis , 1990 , cited in General Department of Women 's Status and Problems , 1996 ) . <p> Consequently , all these studies have indicated that the managerial position is defined in terms of the masculine stereotype and therefore is seen as more suitable for men . This situation creates a barrier for women who want to advance . Therefore , attitudes toward women as managers need to be studied in detail , as it appears that there has not been any research conducted on attitudes toward women managers in Turkey . <p> The Purpose of the Present Study <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sample of Turkish college students . We focused on students because young Turkish students are tomorrow 's employees and managers . We hoped they would provide us with information about future conceptualizations of women managers in Turkey and about future behavior toward women managers , because attitudes influence behavior ( Ajzen &; Fishbein , 1977 ) . In addition , and different from earlier studies in the United States and other countries , we explored how hostile and benevolent sexism may influence attitudes toward women managers . On the basis of results of earlier studies on attitudes toward women managers and leaders , patriarchy , and hostile-benevolent sexism , we formed the following predictions : Consistent with earlier research suggesting that women have more positive attitudes toward women managers than do men ( Adeyemi-Bello &; Tomkiewicz , 1996 ; Heilman , Block , Martell , &; Simon , 1989 ; Schein , Mueller , &; Jacobson , 1989 ) , we expected Turkish women to show more positive attitudes toward women managers than Turkish men . We expected the participants who scored high on support for patriarchy to have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on support for patriarchy . Similarly , because hostile sexism can be accepted as a subtle form of patriarchy ( Glick &; Fiske , 1997 ) , we expected participants who scored high on hostile sexism to have more negative attitudes toward women managers than those who scored low on hostile sexism . We expected that patriarchy and hostile sexism would explain the negative attitudes toward women managers more than benevolent sexism would . Method <p> Participants and Procedure <p> The participants were 183 ( 92 men , 91 women ) Turkish undergraduate students from the Middle East Technical University who attended elective courses in general psychology and an Introduction to Social Psychology . Data for 4 participants were excluded because their questionnaires were incomplete . Mean ages were 21.28 years ( SD = 1.75 ) for the men and 20.67 years ( SD = 2.10 ) for the women . The participants were of the upper or middle class . They participated voluntarily and were given extra credit for completing the questionnaires . <p> Materials <p> To measure attitudes toward women as managers , we developed a new 18-item questionnaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appropriate for Turkish culture and was also timely . All the items were rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 to 6 . Higher scores reflected positive attitudes toward women managers . <p> Factor analysis showed that the data explained 70% of the total variance . The first factor measured participants ' general approval and trust of women managers ( eigenvalue = 11.48 ) and accounted for 63.82% of total variance . A few sample items were " I support women to be managers " ; " I would not like to be directed by a women manager at my workplace " ; and " I trust women managers . " <p> The second factor measured participants ' attitudes toward the methods women managers use to reach management levels ( eigenvalue = 1.14 ) and accounted for 6.34% of the total variance . Sample items were " Women use their attractiveness to be promoted in their job " and " There are many tactics that women use to move up in their career . " Cronbach alphas for the whole scale , for the first , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . We performed a test-retest analysis , which showed a high correlation between the first administration of the scale and the re-administration of it ( r = .90 ) . <p> To illustrate the convergent validity of the newly constructed scale , participants also completed the Women as Managers Scale ( WAMS ; Peters , Terborg , &; Taylor , 1974 ) . WAMS results were highly correlated with results on our scale ( r = .85 , p < .001 ) , suggesting that our scale is able to measure constructs similar to those measured by the WAMS . <p> We used the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory ( Glick &; Fiske , 1996 ) to measure sexism . The scale includes two main dimensions : hostile sexism ( e.g. , " Feminists are making entirely reasonable demands of men " ; " Most women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist " ) and benevolent sexism ( e.g. , " Men are complete without women " ; " A good woman should be set on a pedestal by her man " ) . Cronbach alphas for the whole scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and .78 , respectively . Participants indicated agreement with each item on a scale ranging from 1 ( indicating nonsexist ) to 6 ( indicating sexist attitudes toward women ) . <p> We developed a 4-item scale ( a = .85 ) to measure patriarchy . The items were " Women 's careers should not come before marriage and family " ( a = .88 ) ; " Family structure is influenced negatively if the woman works " ( a = .85 ) ; " Women should not find a job and work before taking consent of their husbands " ( a = .84 ) ; and " The most important responsibility of women is to look after their children and to take care of the home " ( a = .75 ) . <p> The scale explained 69.61% of the total variance . Participants indicated agreement with each item on a scale from 1 ( indicating low support for patriarchy ) to 6 ( indicating high support for patriarchy ) . The patriarchy data were used as an independent variable . The participants who scored lower than the median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarchy ; the participants who scored above the median were considered to have high support for patriarchy . Results <p> We calculated the correlations between variables in the study , patriarchy , hostile sexism , benevolent sexism , and attitudes toward women managers . Hostile sexism ( r = -.64 , p < .01 ) , and patriarchy ( r = -.68 , p < .01 ) were significantly correlated with attitudes toward women managers . However , benevolent sexism was not significantly correlated with attitudes toward women managers ( r = -.11 , ns ) . <p> We used median splits so that patriarchy and hostile sexism could be treated as independent variables . The participants who scored lower than 2.50 in support of patriarchy or 3.5455 in support of hostile sexism were accepted as low in support of patriarchy and hostile sexism . Those who scored higher than the aforementioned medians were accepted as high in support of patriarchy and hostile sexism . We then performed a three-way multiple analysis of covariance ( MANCOVA ) , using benevolent sexism as the covariant , to examine , by gender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mdn = 2.50 ) and hostile sexism ( low vs. high ; Mdn = 3.5455 ) influenced attitudes toward women managers . The results of the MANCOVA showed that the main effects of patriarchy , F ( 1,161 ) = 19.36 , p < .05 , ? = .10 ; hostile sexism , F ( 1,161 ) = 16.37 , p < .05 , ? = .09 ; and gender , F ( 1,161 ) = 13.86 , p < .05 , ? = .07 , were statistically significant . <p> The participants who scored high in support of patriarchy held less positive attitudes toward women managers ( M = 3.87 , SD = 0.96 ) than did others who scored low in support of patriarchy ( M = 5.08 , SD = 0.74 ) . Participants who scored high in hostile sexism also held less positive attitudes toward women managers ( M = 3.90 , SD = 1.00 ) than did those who scored low in hostile sexism ( M = 5.09 , SD = 0.70 ) . In addition , the men held less favorable attitudes toward women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than did the women ( M = 5.10 , SD = 0.71 ) . See Table 1 for the complete statistics . <p> To examine the third hypothesis , we performed a multiple regression analysis . The regression analysis showed that , taken together , support for patriarchy , hostile sexism , and benevolent sexism accounted for 58% of the variance in attitudes toward women managers , F ( 3,166 ) = 78.79 , p < .01 . As expected , support for patriarchy and hostile sexism was more important for explaining less favorable attitudes toward women managers than was benevolent sexism ( see Table 2 ) . Discussion <p> The purpose of the present study was to explore attitudes of Turkish college students toward women managers . We explored the effects of gender differences , patriarchy , and hostile and benevolent sexism . Consistent with earlier studies in other countries ( e.g. , Dubno , 1985 ; Farmer &; Waugh , 1999 ) , male participants held less positive attitudes toward women managers than did female participants , perhaps because of the women 's psychological identification with their own career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other researchers , women are less sexist than men ( Glick &; Fiske , 1996 ; Swim , Aikin , Hall , &; Hunter , 1995 ) and show more tolerance toward stigmatized groups such as homosexuals ( Sakalli , 2002 ) . Consequently , it was not suprising that the women held more positive attitudes toward women managers than did the men . Thus , our first hypothesis was supported . <p> Our second hypothesis was also supported . Participants who had high scores on support for patriarchy held less positive attitudes toward women managers than did those with low scores on that issue . And participants who scored high on hostile sexism held less positive attitudes toward women managers than did those who scored low on hostile sexism . As expected , our regression analysis showed that support for patriarchy and hostile sexism were more important for explaining less favorable attitudes toward women managers than was benevolent sexism . The result was consistent with the findings of Glick et al . ( 1997 ) that hostile sexism , but not benevolent sexism , predicted negative attitudes toward career-oriented women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the economic subordination of women , and traditional gender roles ( Glick &; Fiske , 1997 ) , participants who accepted patriarchal ideology were naturally against women working in managerial positions . <p> Benevolent sexism also represents sexist beliefs , but it includes behaviors typically categorized as prosocial or intimacy seeking ( Glick &; Fiske , 1996 ) . Because benevolent sexism covers protective paternalism ( protecting , helping women ) , complementary gender differentiation ( favoring women ) , and heterosexual intimacy ( feelings of personal need , intense affection for and admiration of women ) , the correlation between benevolent sexism and attitudes toward women managers was not significant in the present study ( r = -.11 ) . <p> As suggested by Glick et al . ( 2000 ) , individuals who live in sexist cultures such as Cuba , Nigeria , and Turkey might not recognize benevolent sexism as a form of sexism , even though they immediately recognize hostile sexism , and the result might be a nonsignificant relationship between benevolent sexism and attitudes toward women managers . However , people who live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to recognize benevolent sexism as a form of sexism and reject it along with hostile sexism ( Glick et al. , 2000 ) . <p> Consequently , there may be a significant correlation between sexism and attitudes toward women managers in other countries that are less sexist . In other words , studies conducted in less sexist countries might have different results from the present study ; benevolent sexism may be strongly relevant to negative attitudes toward women managers in less sexist countries . <p> In the future , researchers should focus on how hostile and benevolent sexism might influence attitudes toward women managers in other cultures . Such studies and their application to real life might help individuals , both women and men , to recognize the paradox of the concept that " women are wonderful , but still we ca n't hire or promote them . " Individuals might learn the distinction between hostile and benevolent sexism and the importance of benevolent sexism to gain acceptance ( rather than resistance ) in low-status groups and sexist cultures . <p> Address correspondence to Nuray Sakalli-Ugurlu , Psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Orta Dogu Teknik niversitesi ) , 06531 , Ankara , Turkey ; nurays@metu.edu.tr ( e-mail ) .

##4001274 ABSTRACT . To investigate the relationship between worry and sense of humor , the author administered the Worry Domains Questionnaire ( WDQ ; F. Tallis , M. Eysenck , &; A. Matthews , 1992 ) and the Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale ( MSHS ; J. A. Thorson &; F. C. Powell , 1993 ) to 140 undergraduates . Worry was negatively related to sense of humor . Results of a stepwise regression , using the WDQ as the criterion and the MSHS factors as predictors , showed that the humor production factor of the MSHS loaded negatively on Step 1 and the coping with humor factor loaded positively on Step 2 . The results are discussed in relation to W. E. Kelly and M. J. Miller 's ( 1999 ) cognitive model of worry and worry as a coping strategy . <p> Key words : anxiety , coping , humor , worry <p> WORRY , a sequence of negative , sometimes seemingly uncontrollable thoughts ( Borkovec , 1994 ) is a commonly experienced phenomenon . Indeed , Tallis , Davey , and Capuzzo ( 1994 ) found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once every day . Despite the obvious transitory nature of worry , much of the recent research has approached this phenomenon as a trait , or a propensity to worry . For instance , commonly used measures of worry , such as the Worry Domains Questionnaire ( WDQ ; Tallis , Eysenck , &; Mathews , 1992 ) , have test-retest reliabilities that indicate they measure trait worry ( Tallis , Davey , &; Bond , 1994 ) . <p> Researchers investigating the characteristics of individuals who have a propensity to worry ( trait worriers ) have reported that worriers , when compared with nonworriers , tend to report more physical discomforts , obsessional symptoms , boredom , depression , stress , anxiety , perfectionism , and pessimism ( Borkovec , Robinson , Pruzinsky , &; DuPree , 1983 ; Chang , 2000 ; Jung , 1993 ; Kelly &; Markos , 2001 ; MacLeod , 1994 ; Starcevic , 1995 ; Tallis &; de Silva , 1992 ) . It is noteworthy that although worry is a sympton of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ; American Psychiatric Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , Davey ( 1993 ) reported that worry and anxiety account for separate variances in coping . Worry is more often associated with active cognitive coping , whereas anxiety is associated with avoidant coping , which indicates that worry and anxiety are separate constructs . <p> Kelly and Miller ( 1999 ) proposed a cognitive model of worry that is helpful for conceptualizing individual differences in worry . They suggested that trait worriers ' assumptions about themselves and the world in general are dysfunctional . More specifically , worriers have developed three primary underlying beliefs : ( a ) Everything is potentially dangerous ; ( b ) they should be able to find a perfect solution to every problem and/or avoid potential negative consequences ; and ( c ) they are inadequate or helpless to protect themselves or solve their problems . <p> Hence , worriers attempt to cognitively evaluate situations and their abilities to protect themselves in or from those situations . It follows that the combination of worriers ' beliefs that they should be able to solve their problems and their inadequacy to solve problems elicits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying beliefs about themselves and the world in general determine individuals ' information processing and characteristic ways of thinking and behaving ( i.e. , personality ) . <p> Perhaps because of the unpleasant traits and experiences associated with worry ( i.e. , anxiety , depression , pessimism ) and the feelings of inadequacy characteristic of many worriers ( Kelly &; Miller , 1999 ) , positive attributes have rarely been examined in relation to worry . One would expect that worry would be conversely related to positive traits , and this is often the case . For instance , Chang ( 2000 ) reported that worry is negatively related to life satisfaction . However , worry is not always negatively related to positive behaviors or traits . Kelly and Ashley ( 2001 ) found that worry was negatively related to excessive alcohol use . Individuals who were less likely to worry were more likely to engage in excessive alcohol consumption . <p> It appears that , despite the negative connotations of worry , it may serve some positive functions . Davey ( 1994 ) found that worry often functions as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive which has not been examined in relation to trait worry is sense of humor . <p> Martin ( 1998 ) defined sense of humor as comprehension , appreciation , and creation of humor . Consistent with this general definition , Thorson and Powell ( 1993 ) suggested that a sense of humor consists of several elements , including recognition of oneself as humorous , recognition of others ' humor , appreciation of humor , a propensity to laugh , a perspective that allows an appreciation of life 's absurdities , and the use of humor to cope . Humor , according to McGhee ( 1979 ) , incorporates a general attitude of playfulness and a coinciding ability to play on ideas . The cognitive ability to manipulate and reframe ideas playfully enables individuals with a sense of humor to view unpleasant events as funny instead of frightening , annoying , or stressful . It is not surprising , therefore , that individuals with a greater sense of humor do not endorse depression , loneliness , negative mood , and social inadequacy ( Cetola , 1988 ; Moran &; Massam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarmany-Schuller , &; Hampes , 1997 ) and endorse task motivation , cheerfulness , self-esteem , trust , and social dominance ( Hampes , 1999 ; Kuiper , McKenzie , &; Belanger , 1995 ; Overholser , 1992 ; Ruch &; Carrell , 1998 ; Thorson &; Powell , 1996 ) . <p> Several researchers have documented the fact that a sense of humor moderates , or reduces , negative or unpleasant affect . For example , Yovetick , Dale , and Hudak ( 1990 ) found that individuals scoring higher on sense of humor report less anxiety than individuals scoring lower on sense of humor even when placed in an anxious situation . Newman and Stone ( 1996 ) reported that humor leads to decreased self-reported tension and decreased physiological activity associated with stress . Labott and Martin ( 1987 ) indicated that coping by using a sense of humor buffers the effects of negative events on mood states . Brown and Keegan ( 1999 ) found that humor also relieved boredom . Hence , possessing a sense of humor tends to moderate stress and anxiety and allows individuals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although there have been increases in both the humor and worry literatures , both of these topics continue to be relatively neglected by researchers . At the time of this writing , I found no published investigations of the relationship between worry and sense of humor . Therefore , my purpose in this study was to examine this relationship . On the basis of the previous literature establishing the fact that high worry and a low sense of humor have both been related to negative psychological outcomes and that individuals with a greater sense of humor are better able to thwart negative thinking and affect , I hypothesized that worry would have a significant and negative relationship to sense of humor . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were 140 individuals ( 89 women , 51 men ) enrolled in undergraduate courses at a mid-sized , southwestern university . Totals do not always equal 140 , however , because some data were missing . The average age of the sample was 23.8 ( SD = 8.0 ) , ranging from 18 to 57 . There was no significant difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .82 . The majority of participants identified themselves as Caucasian ( 63.6% ) . Other ethnicities included African American ( 12.1% ) , Latino ( 7.9% ) , and Asian American ( 12.9% ) . Five ( 3.5% ) respondents did not identify their ethnicity . <p> Instruments <p> I assessed worry with the Worry Domains Questionnaire ( WDQ ; Tallis , Eysenck , &; Matthews , 1992 ) . The original WDQ included 30 items assessing six domains of worry . However , I found one domain ( social concerns ) to be highly related to social desirability . Hence , in this study I used the 25-item WDQ , which does not include the social concerns domain presented by Tallis , Davey , and Bond ( 1994 ) . The 25-item WDQ measures a tendency to worry across five general worry domains , including relationships , lack of confidence , aimless future , work , and financial . <p> The WDQ begins with the statement , " I worry ... " Sample items include " that others will not approve of me , " " that I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might make myself look stupid . " I presented the WDQ items with a 5-point Likert-type scale on which individuals described their experience as not at all to extremely in agreement with individual items . I summed the responses from the appropriate items to create the worry domains and a total WDQ score . Test-retest reliability ( r = .79 after 4 weeks ) , internal consistency ( a = .92 ) , and validity of the WDQ have been found to be satisfactory ( Tallis , Davey , &; Bond , 1994 ) . <p> I measured sense of humor using the Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale ( MSHS ; Thorson &; Powell , 1993 ) . The MSHS is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses humor across four factors : Humor Production , Coping With Humor , Humor Appreciation , and Attitudes Toward Humor . Participants rate each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree . Sample items include " I can say things in such a way as to make people laugh , " " Coping by using humor is an elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who generate humor . " The MSHS was developed through a series of factor analyses from a pool of 124 items . Thorson and Powell ( 1993 ) reported that the four factors remained stable across several large samples . They also reported a coefficient alpha of .92 for the full MSHS . <p> Procedure <p> After the participants had given informed consent , I administered the WDQ and MSHS in random order . The participants also completed a demographics survey that solicited information about age , gender , and ethnicity . They then completed the questionnaires in a group setting . Specific information regarding the nature of the study was not disclosed until participants returned the questionnaires . Results <p> Means , standard deviations , and internal consistencies of the WDQ , MSHS , and their respective subscales are presented in Table 1 . A simple regression was calculated using total WDQ scores as the predictor variable and total MSHS scores as the criterion . WDQ scores accounted for 3% of the variance in MSHS scores . This result was significant , F ( 1,138 ) = 4.37 , p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that higher worry scores were related to lower MSHS scores ( = -.18 ) . <p> Because of the lack of previous research in this area , I used an exploratory approach to investigate the relationships among the WDQ domains , MSHS factors , and total scores for both scales . Because of its ability to investigate the " best fit " relationships among different variables ( Hair , Anderson , Tatham , &; Black , 1995 ) , I calculated a stepwise multiple regression to identify which types of worry were most related to sense of humor . I used the five WDQ domains as predictor variables and the total MSHS scores as the criterion . The relationships domain was the sole WDQ domain entered on a step accounting for 4% of the variance in total MSHS scores . There was a significant negative relationship between the relationships domain and worry , F ( 1,138 ) = 5.62 , p < .02 , = -.20 . <p> Next , to identify which aspects of sense of humor most related to worry , I calculated another stepwise multiple regression using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the criterion . The Humor Production factor , entered in Step 1 , accounted for 9% of the variance , which was significant , F ( 1,138 ) = 13.59 , p < .0001 , and again negative ( = -.47 ) . The Coping With Humor factor , entered in Step 2 , accounted for an additional 5% of the variance . The increase in variance was significant , F ( 1,137 ) = 7.37 , p < .006 . The beta weights indicated that worry was positively related to coping with humor ( = .28 ) . <p> I calculated separate stepwise multiple regressions using the five WDQ domains as predictor variables and each MSHS factor as the criterion . For the humor production factor , the confidence domain of the WDQ was the only significant predictor , accounting for 10% of the variance in humor production scores , F ( 1,138 ) = 16.06 , p = .0001 , = -.32 . For each of the subsequent regressions , using the remaining MSHS factors as the criterion , I found no WDQ domains that accounted for significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of this study supported the hypothesis . That is , worry has a significantly negative relationship to sense of humor . Thus , it seems that individuals with a sense of humor are less likely to worry . This finding is consistent with previous research in which lower scores on sense of humor were related to negative psychological outcomes ( Nezu , Nezu , &; Blissett , 1988 ; Overholser , 1992 ) and with the finding of Cann , Holt , and Calhoun ( 1999 ) that humor moderates the negative outcomes of stressful events . Russell and Davey ( 1993 ) found that worry appears to occur often as the result of stressful life events . Hence , a sense of humor might moderate the relationship between stress and worry . Researchers should explore this possible moderating effect . <p> The multiple regression results indicated that the Humor Production factor of the MSHS largely contributed to the negative relationship between worry and sense of humor . An understanding of the personality of worriers provides a partial explanation for this result . Because of the fears and inadequacies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , one might assume that worriers would be less likely to participate in risky situations in which they feel unprotected or inadequate . <p> The hesitation of worriers to participate in risky situations appears to also include social situations . A commonly reported characteristic of worriers appears to be a fear of negative social evaluation . Pruzinsky and Borkovec ( 1990 ) found that worriers reported significantly more self-focused attention and social anxiety for publicly displayed aspects of themselves than did nonworriers . Thus , worriers would likely avoid placing themselves in risky social situations that might result in a negative evaluation by others . <p> The production of humor may appear to worriers to be a risky situation that could elicit negative evaluation by others . The relationship found between the confidence worries domain of the WDQ and humor production partially supports this possibility . If worries about confidence hinder individuals from producing humor , it might be expected that worriers would question their ability to produce humor in such a way that others would find favorable . Future research is necessary to determine whether a fear of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A similar explanation might be made for the relationship between worries about relationships and humor . That is , individuals who worry about disrupting , or losing , relationships might be less inclined to use humor for fear that others will not approve of their humor . <p> One interesting finding was that coping with humor was positively related to worry . This result can be partially explained by the functions of worry . For instance , after accounting for anxiety , worry , as measured by the WDQ , has been described as an active cognitive coping mechanism ( Davey , 1994 ) . Hence , if worry and humor both serve as coping mechanisms , it is less surprising that worry and coping with humor are positively related . <p> The results of the present study have implications for the treatment of worry . Previous research indicates that humor is helpful in decreasing negative affective and cognitive states ( Cann et al. , 1999 ; Moran , 1996 ; Moran &; Massam , 1999 ; Newman &; Stone , 1996 ) . Therefore , increasing the production of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce worry and other unpleasant affective states , such as depression , which often coexist with worry ( Starcevic , 1995 ) . Furthermore , there is evidence that humor might be more effective in reducing unpleasant psychological outcomes among worriers than among individuals who are not prone to worry . Newton and Dowd ( 1990 ) reported that using therapeutic interventions involving absurdities is more effective with individuals reporting less sense of humor ( such as worriers ) than with individuals who have a greater sense of humor . Using respectful humorous therapeutic interventions , increasing the production of humor , and facilitating a more playful , humorous perspective among clients may prove to be helpful techniques for counselors working with worriers . <p> The relatively low percentage of shared variance between worry and sense of humor should be noted . For instance , although the results were as predicted -- a significant negative relationship was found between worry and sense of humor-the percentage of shared variance between the WDQ and MSHS was somewhat low ( 3% ) . However , the statistical significance of the results indicates that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston , 1981 ) . The amount of shared variance ( 10% ) between humor production ( of the MSHS ) and confidence ( of the WDQ ) also suggests that a meaningful and predictable relationship exists between these two variables . Moreover , the high internal consistencies of the scales ( see Table 1 ) suggest that the scales were not greatly affected by error variance ( Nunnally , 1978 ) . Thus , it is likely that the relationship between the two variables in this study is stable and relatively free of error variance . <p> The present study has several limitations that should be considered by future researchers . For instance , the results are based on a college student sample . Therefore , the clinical implications noted in this discussion are tentative . Studies involving clinical samples should be conducted . Also , in the present study I used only one instrument to measure each construct . Future research should include additional measures of worry and sense of humor . <p> In addition , there are some statistical limitations of the present study . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they sometimes are prone to an inflated risk of capitalizing on chance relationships specific to the sample ( Judd &; McClelland , 1989 ) . Although I believe the use of a stepwise regression was warranted because of the exploratory nature of some analyses used in this study , future studies should include different regression approaches in an attempt to replicate and expand the findings of the present study . <p> Future research should include larger , more diverse samples to attempt to replicate the findings of the present study . A further exploration of the relationship between humor production and worry may provide useful information for understanding reasons worriers report less sense of humor and production of humor . For instance , one question for future research is whether lower humor production among worriers is the result of a fear of negative evaluation or the result of another as yet undetermined factor , such as social inhibition or self-focused attention . More research is also needed to experimentally evaluate the clinical efficacy of using humor as a therapeutic technique for worriers . <p> The author would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful comments on an earlier draft of this article . <p> Address correspondence to William E.

##4001278 ABSTRACT . The Emotional Stroop ( ES ) task ( I. H. Gotlib &; C. D. McCann , 1984 ) has been proposed as an experimental measure to assess the processing of emotion or the bias in attention of emotion-laden information . However , study results have not been consistent . To further examine its reliability for empirical research , the authors of this study administered the ES task to 33 participants on 2 separate occasions separated by 1 week . Results indicated that retest reliabilities for reaction times ( RTs ) derived from the 3 separate emotion conditions ( manic , neutral , and depressive ) across the 1 week interval were very high . However , consistent with previous research , the reliabilities were very low for the interference indices ( manic and depressive ) . These low reliabilities reflect the very high intercorrelation between the RTs derived from the 3 conditions . The authors concluded that a better indicator of the reliability for this task is the individual RTs from each emotion condition . <p> Key words : emotion , emotional Stroop , reliability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; McCann , 1984 ) is based on the original Stroop task ( Stroop , 1935 ) , which has previously been used to examine attentional processes and the well-known interference or Stroop effect . Results from studies employing the Stroop task have revealed that participants require a longer time to name the color of a stimulus when the word is incongruent than when it appears as a solid color square . That is , they have trouble saying " blue " when blue ink is used in printing the word " red . " <p> Researchers are beginning to focus on the abnormal processing of emotion or attention in emotion-related ( e.g. , affective ) disorders ( Austin et al. , 1999 ; Franke , Maier , Hardt , &; Frieboes , 1993 ; Hill &; Knowles , 1991 ; Kinderman , 1994 ; Lemelin &; Baruch , 1998 ; Tarbuck &; Paykel , 1995 ) . To assess the processing of emotional information in psychiatric disorders , such as depression , researchers may adapt traditional cognitive tests ; the Stroop task has been adapted for research examining the processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams &; Nulty , 1986 ) <p> The ES task differs from the Stroop task in that emotional- and neutral-content words are presented instead of color-incongruent words and the interference effect is a result of emotional content rather than incongruence of color . Williams , Mathews , and MacLeod ( 1996 ) hypothesized that the ES task measures attentional bias because depressed individuals perform poorly at color naming when the words have a depressed content than when the words have a neutral or manic content . Response latencies from depressed individuals are longer when the stimulus material is negatively valenced than when the material is neutral or positively valenced ( Kindt , Bierman &; Brosschot , 1996 ; Segal , Gemar , Truchon , Guirguis , &; Horowitz , 1995 ; Siegrist , 1997 ; Williams &; Nulty , 1986 ) . <p> It has been assumed that the emotional modification of the cognitive paradigm allows the measurement of inhibition of emotional information in much the same manner as the original cognitive paradigm measures inhibition of cognitive processes ( Kindt et al. , 1996 ) . However , this has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing emotional information is qualitatively different and that such information follows a different neural pathway than emotionally neutral ( cognitive ) information . <p> Results from previous studies using the ES task have been inconsistent ( Williams et al. , 1996 ) and may reflect the fact that it is not a reliable measure . Reliability of the ES task has been investigated in only two previous studies ( Kindt et al. , 1996 ; Siegrist , 1997 ) , with negative results . Kindt et al . Found the reliability of emotional content words to be low ( r = .19 and .25 ) . This finding was replicated by Siegrist using self-relevant words ( r = -.04 ) . <p> A possible threat to the validity of these two studies is the confounding problem in the analysis of reliability of difference scores . This is the paradox for the measurement of change ( Murphy &; Davidshofer , 1994 ; Overall &; Woodward , 1975 ) . The paradox occurs when two variables are highly correlated . The reliabilities of the difference scores for these variables are then always low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores are assumed to be made up of true scores and error scores . If two scores are highly correlated , then the true scores must overlap considerably . Therefore , there will be hardly any difference between the true scores , and the difference seen will be almost entirely due to measurement error . <p> Independent of this possible paradox effect , there were a number of minor problems in these previous studies that could be corrected in future research . First , although supposedly healthy controls were used in both studies , the researchers did not take into account the emotional condition of the participants , as there was no assessment of their emotional state . Second , the Kindt et al . ( 1996 ) study retested participants 3 months after the initial testing , although Carmines and Zeller ( 1979 ) recommended that retesting should be conducted no later than 1 month after the initial testing . Another potential problem is in the selection of the emotion-laden and non-laden words . Hill and Knowles ( 1991 ) attributed the lack of consistent findings to the selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gotlib and McCann ( 1984 ) and Gotlib and Cane ( 1987 ) were the best types of words to produce an interference effect . Neither of the two previously published studies used the recommended emotional adjectives from the Gotlib studies . <p> Our aim in the present study was to examine the test-retest reliability of the ES task using the Gotlib adjectives . Of particular relevance to this objective was an assessment of the reliability of the interference effects . We examined the paradox within this context . We formed the following hypotheses : If the variables are not highly correlated , the low reliability will indicate that the test should not be used in future research examining emotional processing in either nonclinical situations or for disorders of emotion . If there is low test-retest reliability but the main variables are highly correlated , this will indicate that the test-retest statistic is not appropriate for this task . A high test-retest reliability for the interference effect may indicate that the methodological differences between the present study and the two previously reported studies account for these differences and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were 33 members of the staff or student body at Swinburne University or acquaintances of the investigators ( 19 women and 14 men , with a mean age of 27 years SD = 5.54 ) . We screened all the participants for any medical or psychological illnesses by having them complete a standard mental health questionnaire , and all provided informed written consent to participate . The research was approved by the Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee . All participants were of White European origin . <p> Materials <p> The task we administered was based on the ES task developed by Gotlib and McCann ( 1984 ) and consisted of color words presented on a computer screen using Arial Black font , size 72 . In total , 120 words were selected from the list supplied by Gotlib and McCann . Of these words , 40 were depressive , 40 were neutral and 40 were manic . We presented the words in one of four colors ; red , green , white , and blue . The object of the task was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . We administered the Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ; Beck , Steer , &; Brown , 1996 ) at both Time 1 and Time 2 to exclude any potential changes in mood over the testing interval . <p> Procedure <p> We tested the participants on two occasions , 1 week apart . We seated them approximately 1 m in front of a computer screen with headphones and a microphone to record response time ( RT ) for the ES task . We instructed the participants to say the color of the presented word as quickly as they could because we were recording their RTs . The words were presented for 1.5 s . Between each word presentation there was a blank screen for 250 ms and a fixation cross for 1 s . To minimize order effects , we gave half the participants the depressive words first , followed by neutral words , and finally the manic words . The remaining participants received the words in the opposite order ( i.e. , manic , followed by neutral and depressive words ) . Results <p> BDI-II scores ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 2 , respectively . The mean BDI-II score for Session 1 was 2.88 ( SD - 3.27 ) and for Session 2 , 2.19 ( SD- 2.74 ) ; these means reflected very low scores on this scale . A two-tailed t test indicated that the change in the mean score was not significant , t(31) = 1.71 , p > .05 . <p> The mean RTs ( from Session 1 to Session 2 ) were stable over time ( Table 1 ) . Correlations were also computed from RTs in the neutral , depressive , and manic conditions at Time 1 and Time 2 . For neutral words , r = .80 , p < .01 ; for depressive words , r = .80 , p < .01 ; and for manic words , r = .77 , p < .01 . These correlations indicate that the RTs derived from each of the emotional conditions were consistent over time . For each category of words , the correlation was positive . <p> As stated previously , the ES task is an interference task . Hence , test-retest reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reaction times ( RTs ) . To calculate the reliability of the interference effect , we subtracted the RTs for the emotional words from the neutral words ( e.g. , depressive interference RT depressed - RT neutral , and manic interference RT manic - RT neutral ) for both Time 1 and Time 2 . Test-retest reliability correlations for the interference effect of the ES words were r = .24 , p > .05 , for depressive words and r = -.11 , p > .05 , for manic words . These correlations were nonsignificant and unacceptably low for the purposes of test-retest reliability and indicate the lack of reliability for depressive and manic interference effect . Thus , the interference effects from Session 1 are not comparable to the interference effects seen at Session 2 . <p> We conducted a further analysis on the RTs to examine the paradox for the reliability of difference scores . The correlations of RTs of emotional words with neutral words are contained in Table 2 ; all the correlations were positive , significant , and very strong , and r values were .90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotional words were strongly correlated with the RTs of the neutral words . Discussion <p> Our major aim in the present study was to examine the test-retest reliabilities of the three emotion conditions as well as the interference indices . The interference indices had been previously hypothesized to reflect the bias in processing emotion-laden words . Our results indicated high test-retest reliabilities for the RTs derived from each emotion condition separately but low test-retest reliabilities for the interference indices . <p> Because the reliability of the interference indices was very low , additional analysis were conducted to confirm the paradox . The low test-retest reliability for the interference indices may have been because of the paradox of using change scores when two measures are highly correlated or , in fact , because of the very low reliability of the interference indices . RTs from all three conditions ( depression , neutral , and manic ) were highly correlated in the present study , indicating that test-retest reliability may not be a valid statistic to use in establishing the reliability of these indices . Perhaps it would be more suitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in the individual emotion conditions . These findings are consistent with past studies examining the reliability of the ES task ( Kindt et al. , 1996 ; Siegrist , 1997 ) . <p> The modification of the present study using the Gotlib list of words produced test-retest correlations for RTs derived from the different emotion conditions similar to those reported in the two previous studies examining the reliability of the ES . The correlations previously reported were by Kindt et al . ( r = .65 to .84 ) and by Siegrist ( r = .84 to .91 ) . <p> For both these previous studies ( Kindt et al. , 1996 ; Siegrist , 1997 ) as well as the current study , participants were recruited from a university population . The results of the present study indicate that the poor test-retest reliability of the interference effect of the ES is most likely to be due to the " paradox of measurement change . " It is now important for researchers to determine how these interference reliability scores compare with scores in clinical populations , especially given that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in depressed and anxious individuals ( Williams et al. , 1996 ) . <p> It is only possible to conclude from the present study that the ES task is reliable when measuring RTs derived from the different emotional conditions . Because of the difficulties in the analysis of difference scores , the reliability of the interference effects remains unknown . Nevertheless , because the RTs derived from the different conditions were highly correlated , it would be sensible to suggest that the interference produced by the ES is also likely to be highly reliable . <p> Address correspondence to P.

##4000550 Whenever I read about another episode of college cheating , I think of a scene in Rounders , a movie about two high-stakes poker buddies who have known each other since high school . One is a character played by Matt Damon . He 's a poker genius , someone who calculates odds with lightning precision and makes precise inferences from the betting . The other , played by Ed Norton , is a shady character who 's just finished a prison term . He 's also a superb poker player . But his specialty is systematic cheating , dealing surreptitious winners -- " hangers , " in poker slang : cards dealt from the middle or bottom of the deck -- to himself or his partner . <p> Norton 's crooked dealing allows them to clean out a bunch of rich kids in a college game . The two buddies then locate a weekly high-stakes game played by off-duty state cops . The cops , unlike the college kids , are n't suckers . Norton is caught dealing a hanger , and a moment later the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody and bruised from the beating they 've just been given by the other poker players . <p> There are , it seems to me , two levels to this scene . The first is the obvious one : a weekly poker session is what is called a zero-sum game . If you and I have both put our stakes into the pot , your cheating means that you are , in effect , stealing from me . It 's a situation in which everyone has a personal stake in seeing that everyone else stays honest . <p> The second is less obvious . At a certain deep level of social consciousness , there 's an almost intuitive sense that cheating threatens the whole set of relations that allow groups to function . Children know this instinctively . They react loudly against other children who cheat at games . <p> This is where the parking-lot scene in Rounders tells us something about college cheating . It 's essential that Norton was caught red-handed in a private game , one in which everyone had a stake in seeing everyone else obeyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though by moral instinct , why cheating is always an ugly practice . When you change this essential element , everything else changes too . <p> In the days when university grades were given out as an honest measure of academic and intellectual performance , cheating on exams or papers was a lot like the poker game in Rounders , a situation in which everyone was immediately aware that people who cheated were mocking or disvaluing the achievement of those who were acting honestly . <p> Today , all this has changed . It 's the cheaters who are in control of the moral climate in which exams are given and papers assigned , and students who act honorably are very nearly paralyzed by a diffidence or timorousness about calling public attention to what is going on . <p> A lot of the explanation of why this change has occurred , it seems to me , has to do with grade inflation , which by taking away all legitimate standards of actual performance has turned cheating into a matter of " beating the system . " To understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private poker game in Rounders , the practice of card-counting in casino blackjack . In 1962 , drawing on an analysis published by a group of statisticians , Edward O. Thorp published his famous book Beat the Dealer , teaching people a way to beat the odds in a Las Vegas casino . ( As the game proceeds , a player who has memorized which cards have been played knows by inverse inference what cards remain in the deck -- a deck rich in 10 's and Aces shifts the odds dramatically in favor of the player , a deck with lots of 5 's and 6 's shifts them in favor of the house . ) <p> The casinos have gone to great lengths to deal with card-counters . Dealers use multiple decks . Known card counters are banned from the casinos , their pictures kept on file by security personnel . In return , some card counters are suing , claiming that , since they 're not doing anything technically illegal , such banning is unjust . <p> While the courts are deciding the issue , card counting has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important about college cheating . In the period directly after Thorp published Beat the Dealer , many card counters went to casinos along with friends who knew they were using the card-counting system . These friends , who had not taught themselves card-counting methods , usually stood beside the card-counters , playing blackjack in the regular way . But none felt cheated when the card-counter won large sums of money by beating the odds . If anything , they felt admiration : the card counter had n't taken anything away from them -- he 'd only " beaten the house , " put one over on an impersonal system that was , in a sense , the opponent of every player in the casino . <p> It 's the notion of " beating the system , " one suspects , that accounts not only for the widespread cheating that goes on in colleges and universities today , but also the demoralization of the honest students who might otherwise be counted on to resent the way the dishonesty of their peers insults their own attempts to learn by study and hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate in which cheating is perceived as beating the system . <p> In writing about higher education , the rise in grade inflation and the rise in college cheating are usually treated as separate phenomena . Cheating , in fact , is usually thought to be a problem mainly at lower-level institutions , where either public pressure for " democratic " education or the urgent need of smaller private colleges to keep their enrollments up brings in large numbers of students unable to do college-level work . <p> Grade inflation , on the other hand , is thought to be the special problem of the most selective colleges and universities : it 's at Williams and Harvard and Yale , whose entering classes are filled with students who have never seen a grade lower than A in their lives , that the pressure is supposed to be greatest . When Harvard announced last year that more than half of its undergraduates were getting either an A or an A-in their courses , nobody was surprised to hear that such " good " students were getting such high grades . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as research for an article she 's writing for a campus publication reveals a quite different story . With one of the most talented student pools in the nation , New Jersey has a very high number of students who go off to the Ivies or good liberal arts colleges like Williams and Amherst . What the survey revealed in case after case -- and with evidence that was not merely anecdotal , but could be independently checked -- is that many of these New Jersey high school students had cheated their way into the most selective colleges in the country . <p> That 's surprising enough , but not , perhaps , astonishing . What 's astonishing is the frequency with which cheaters boasted openly about what they 'd done to their high school classmates . In one interview I read , a student talks about an A paper she 'd written for an AP History course . The following semester a classmate , another AP student taking the same course from another teacher , asked to see the paper , " to help her think about the topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , word for word , and when it came back with an A , showed it to its author with a conspiratorial air , as though they 'd been partners in getting away with something . ( The plagiarist is today attending Harvard . ) <p> It 's the brazenness of the cheater 's behavior , it seems to me , that reveals the hidden relation between grade inflation and widespread cheating . In a world where students are given A 's for the most token effort , and where teachers have stopped trying to swim against the tide and give A 's just to avoid trouble , one student 's cheating does n't take anything away from another student 's grade . Like the card counter in blackjack , the cheater is , after all , just beating an impersonal system . <p> In a world where A 's are reserved for the top few students in any class , on the other hand , where B+ and B are reserved for those whose work is genuinely above average , and where those whose work is average for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local community college -- receive C+ or C , the general attitude of students toward cheating is more likely to be like that of the cops in Rounders : to cheat is to take away from others credit they 've honestly earned through talent and hard work . <p> In the days when I myself was trying to hold out against grade inflation , I 'd give a little talk at the beginning of the course about why inflated grades hurt everyone , teachers and students and higher learning as a total enterprise . I 'd begin by putting a certain sentence on the board and asking the class what was wrong with it . The sentence was this : <p> Every student in this room is taller than the height of the average student in this room . <p> " What , " I would ask , " is wrong with that sentence ? " Some would look a bit puzzled , but most would get the point instantly : " It 's a contradiction in terms , " " Whoever wrote that does n't know what ' average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than everybody else . " Then I 'd ask , with as much outward innocence as I could muster , " But what if it were a really tall group . What if it were an NBA team , with everybody at least 6-feet-5-inches tall ? " And the students would get impatient : " That does n't change anything -- it 's the average we 're supposed to be talking about . " Then , looking resigned , as though I did n't quite grasp their point but felt myself to have been shouted down by their collective sense of logical outrage , I 'd put another sentence on the board : <p> Every student in the course got an A for the course . <p> " Now , " I 'd say , with an air of spurious puzzlement . " Is there anything wrong with that sentence ? " And this time , invariably , I would get blankness . Not assumed blankness , or embarrassed blankness , or nervous blankness , but genuine incomprehension . Even the brightest students in the class would honestly not see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence was logically analogous to the first . It was then that I realized that grade inflation represents not simply a local problem in American higher education , but an Alice-in-Wonderland irreality that has all of us , students and professors and administrators , under its spell . <p> It was n't until my student began working on her survey of cheating at Rutgers , though , that I began to understand the deeper sense in which grade inflation promotes cheating . This is where what I called the second level of the Rounders episode comes into play . In the first instance , I grant , pure self-interest is what 's likely to make students intolerant of cheating in any situation where grades reflect actual performance . If your cheating directly harms my chances of getting into medical school or law school or one of the top philosophy programs in the country , I 'm much more likely to tell you to stop . <p> Still , there 's another way of looking at the matter . If I catch you plagiarizing your work from the web or getting high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply want to tell a professor or a dean that I 'm doing my own work , and I want to be measured only against other students who have done theirs . <p> If you look closely , you 'll see that this response is only incidentally an example of what might be called zero-sum outrage , where I 'm angry because your gain equals my loss . Instead , it 's much closer to the reaction that takes us to the second or " ethical " level of the Rounders example . At this level , what makes one angry is a deeper sense that cheating dishonors the very pursuit in which some people are trying their best , working as hard as they can , and taking the objective measure of their performance -- whether it 's a C+ in a calculus course or a 3:18 time in a marathon -- as a true assessment of their accomplishment . <p> Perhaps the worst consequence of grade inflation , in other words , is that it hides or masks the ethical dimension of cheating , even from the honest student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything we might want to think of as a genuine intellectual community . I thought of this recently when , in quite another context , I was reading Anthony Kenny 's A Life in Oxford . Kenny , as many readers will know , is an Oxford philosopher who began his career as an ordained Catholic priest . His gradual estrangement from Catholicism is recounted in A Path from Rome , to which A Life in Oxford is an autobiographical sequel . <p> The moment that caught my attention was this . After he has applied for and achieved laicization , married , and taken up a position at Oxford , Kenny -- by now an agnostic -- continues to attend Catholic Mass . But he does so as a non-Catholic , always careful to limit his participation in the liturgy to those portions that do not imply either religious belief or membership in the Church . His reasoning seems to me exactly appropriate to the subject of grade inflation and cheating : " to recite the Creed or receive Communion would be , in my view , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also an insult to the seriousness with which these actions are undertaken by believers . " <p> There we have , in a nutshell , a logic that brings to light the real moral ugliness of academic cheating . To cheat on an exam or plagiarize a paper is not simply to try to receive credit for work that is beyond one 's own capacity . It is to insult the seriousness with which students who act honorably are taking their university education as a process of personal and intellectual development . In the same way , the dean or " Office of Student Services " who treats cheating as a mere slip or trivial inadvertency is telling every real student on the campus -- the students whom any university worthy of the name ought most to value , encourage , even cherish -- that he or she is valueless , nothing more than another anonymous unit on the endless and indiscriminate assembly line that , at very many schools , passes today as higher education . <p> It 's only when everyone is operating within a system that reliably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one perceives the true moral degradation involved in cheating . It 's only then that the marathoner who has undergone ten months of arduous training will have no hesitation about telling the race officials that the person who finished ahead of him cut through the woods , or that a student who 's put an enormous amount of time into getting an honorable C+ in calculus will get up and tell a classmate copying answers from a friend on the midterm to knock it off . <p> It 's easy enough to see that the cops who beat up the card cheats in Rounders were at some level motivated by self-interest . It 's harder to see that , beyond that , they were instinctively acting to preserve a certain rudimentary moral contract implicit even in weekend card games . It 's not unreasonable , I think , to ask that university administrators , by putting an end to grade inflation , do what they can to raise the ethical level of their institutions at least to the level of ordinary folks who get together to play a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Virginia Medical Center employee in a staff meeting , quoted approximately below , was enough to prompt the university 's president to issue a strongly worded press release , to impel the medical center CEO to investigate the incident for racial insensitivity , to incite a hasty " Protest against Racism at U.

##4000551 PREFORMATTED TABLE -- A. A. Milne , Winnie-the-Pooh <p> <p> In a promising gesture of diversity , the Modern Language Association has been welcoming community colleges ( CC ) into its conference agendas . Since this sector constitutes the majority of college teachers , and a silent one at that , it could furnish valuable perspectives to the Association . <p> What are these perspectives ? To begin with , take the average CC teacher : The vast majority are agreeably personable and people-oriented , articulate and communicatively disciplined , even after years of service , because the nature of their teaching orientation demands that attitude . How many at the university level can boast so consistent an attitude ? <p> Yes , but do CC instructors publish , it might be asked ? Actually some of us do . Besides , at a time when so much of current humanities publication is of frankly questionable scholarly value , what is the practical difference between that and no publication at all ? <p> CC teachers are practical because their institutions were designed to be so . Here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounds and smells of the Vocational Technology shops one passes with pleasure on the way to class . And by the air conditioning plant , which elsewhere would be hidden bashfully from view , and which is here glass-encased to be enjoyed by connoisseurs for its gleaming industrial craftsmanship . Benjamin Franklin , the craftsman-intellectual par excellence would have felt at home here . This is practicality , rootedness in community . But also savvy : Laney knows the dirty little secret of our so-called techno-information age : Highly-paid traditional crafts are going begging , and can only barely be filled by massive , and often not very legal , immigration . <p> What then would draw the practical-minded CC instructor in search of professional enlightenment to the MLA convention ? As a language teacher my own natural interest in Washington lay in suitable sessions , such as the Foreign Language and Culture session . Naturally I looked for practical suggestions and helpful hints for teaching these , especially for the continuing practical problem of adequately testing for culture in a typical language course . Unfortunately I found none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewail in a general way the misfortune of oppressed minority cultures . Now , even being sympathetic to the causes , I could not help feeling baffled and even patronized : What environment did these speakers come from ? Had they ever been in genuine touch with the objects of their study ? <p> And then it struck me : These were university staff , obviously from an environment different from my own . Here at Laney where the absolute majority of students are from the official minority categories -- a fairly accurate microcosm of Oakland as a whole -- sensitivity to them and their practical needs are a natural part of our practical reality , as part of the CC mission in general . And yet how is it that I as a white male feel vastly more appreciated here than at the elite , overwhelmingly white , private university ( Stanford ) where I also taught extensively ? The difference is ideology : Whereas at that university 's humanities division white males as a group are welcome only if they are avowed stereotypical Marxists and cultural revisionists , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whatever direct practical contribution I can make to each individual 's learning process . How truly rewarding for a teacher ! <p> Here then is the Achilles heel of so many universities : most reality is seen primarily in terms of theory , stand-offishly and sterilely , with too little input from practicality . This is especially true with regard to ideology . Marxism , for example , so often presented as a Rousseauesque utopian vision of perfect social equality and perfect economic justice by government fiat , is on the surface truly attractive -- in theory . And teaching it to gullible post-adolescents who have never participated significantly in any normal economic life is heady stuff . Not that these should be shielded from getting to know it . Quite the contrary . But how ethical is it not to tell these same students the terrible truth that the actual totalitarian practice of Marxism has cost the lives of an estimated 100 million people in the course of the twentieth century , surpassing even Fascism ? On a purely human level must it not be asked , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live with himself asserting that Stalin succeeded , and that Mao did not go far enough in his agenda ( Marxism , 250 ; Ideologies , 2 : 207-8 ) ? Yes , capitalism , if unrestrained , can , and often does , " kill " the soul , but it does not as a rule deliberately target the bodies , not least because it needs them as consumers . Intellectual purists might call this cynical , because they miss lofty visions of youthful sophomoric idealism , but sane common sense also finds it surprisingly practical . Why ? Because it is this attention to mercantile practicality that has saved democratic capitalism , even as admittedly imperfect as it is , from the horrific practical consequences of idealistic but deadly totalitarian Rousseauan utopias . And while Marxists-Leninists like Marcuse and Jameson might dismiss this crucial difference with an amazing verbal sleight-of-hand as democracy 's " repressive tolerance , " it has allowed even them to live and indeed thrive very well personally , has it not ? <p> Students at most universities are intellectually vulnerable . In a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wide scale are divorced from their families at the age of eighteen and thrown together with equally naive peers , often stranded in isolated suburban or country settings ( " farms " ) away from the gritty life experience of city centers . Here an artificially academic lifestyle and correspondingly utopian narrowness of life experience exclude the rich vicissitudes of ordinary personal and public , commercial life . Thus intellectually captive and reality-deprived , young students can become easy prey for conscienceless ideological raptors , who set upon them with more or less refined subtlety . It is an irony of history that the traditional land-grant colleges , originally designed to protect students from the " vices " of city life , have now in many cases become intellectual ghettoes , ideological traps , propaganda camps for proselytizing impressionable youngsters , closer in spirit to the ominous " reeducation camps " of totalitarian regimes than to traditional humanities departments , judging by the curricula . Thus the university experience , which was originally designed to broaden a person 's outlook , is now in danger of being more narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CC students are luckier in this sense . They are for the most part commuters , many with demanding jobs . Daily contact with family and real life are the norm rather than the exception . Ideas learned at school stand at least a minimum chance of being tested at home or at work on a constant basis . Parents of all social backgrounds would be wise to start off their offspring at a CC first until they become mature enough to judge a university experience more critically . <p> Academic remoteness from reality is particularly evident in the epistemologically disastrous presentational jargon of literary and cultural studies . Average visitors to so many MLA convention sessions may be excused for feeling that they have arrived at a sort of Baudelairean " temple o de vivants piliers / laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles . " Honestly , how difficult would it be to require all presenters to state their central thesis clearly in one or two sentences ? But then how many current presentations could survive such a practical test ? We CC teachers work hard to hone our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge as democratically accessible as possible . This requires us to be truly centered as individuals . The current fad of deliberate cultivation of communicational " decenteredness " runs entirely counter to our mission . To use a blunt but honest old adage , the use of " dollar words for nickel concepts " strikes us not only as elitist and antidemocratic , but simply as fraudulent . <p> There is , of course , a reason for this deliberately equivocating language that makes so much of MLA-English sound like a bad translation of notoriously undigestible Hegelian and Heideggerian German , mediated through the artificial , pretentious French of Foucault and Derrida . It is the deliberate goal of undermining the primarily Western empirical language and thought as bourgeois " false consciousness , " the disenfranchisement of the common sense of free thinking individuals , all to one end : Namely , so that radical intellectuals may seize control of public discourse and become Foucault 's " masters of discursivity , " who , priest-like , define and control for the rest of us all truths beyond all ordinary facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to pass . <p> What damage such radical , dogmatic opposition to empirical truth can wreak on an individual is tragically illustrated by Foucault 's personal fate . He died because he refused to acknowledge the empirical evidence of the danger of AIDS . And when he did recognize it , and himself contracted it , he refused to communicate this fact to his sexual partners , with consequences that " can only be surmised " ( Tallis , 3 ) . <p> On an institutional level , what does this epistemological development portend regarding the quality of humanistic studies ? For the cause of any kind of serious science it is plainly a disaster , as the steep decline in useful empirical scholarship indicates , thus threatening to return American literary scholarship to the level of the pre-1950s . Tell-tale signs are such simple things as the vanishing footnote , that instrument of straightforward verifiability and in-depth research . Already a new generation of young critics is establishing itself , one that has little concept or appreciation of plain facts , as current MLA presentations attest . And these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . Moreover , this is the first generation whose view of the world is shaped not only by the massive absorption of television images , but whose informational universe is , in addition , circumscribed largely by the concept of cyberspace . Together these two worlds reduce the perception of reality to the epistemological level of cartoons , devoid of the experiential complexity of ordinary life , producing the kind of existential naivet that incidentally shows up in the amply proven fragility of the " dot.com " economy . Add to this a constricting , mind-numbing set of narrow ideologies , and a vision of the twenty-first-century humanist emerges that can easily make one shudder . <p> This endangerment of the empirical at the university level aggravates a process already under way in American society as a whole , due to the significant social changes of the last decades . As the bulk of American economy and population has moved away from farming , crafts and manufacturing , it is losing the sense of making " real , " tangible , objectively verifiable things , and with it an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high schools over much of America used to include in their curriculum shop classes that taught skills involving hand/eye coordination . These stimulated the brain and instilled in many teens , even the college-bound like me , an appreciation of the value of craftsmanship , and with it a sense of empirical achievement at an early age . Most of these programs have been abandoned with short-sighted fervor in favor of , at best , esthetically narrow computer classes . So now many teens , already largely growing up in experientially narrow , sterile suburbs where their imaginative outlet is limited to unrealistic , manipulated media portrayals of reality , seek illusory achievement in a neurotic , narcissistic sex-and-drugs culture . But worst of all they grow up without a balanced sense of the overall importance of the empirical in daily life . <p> The challenge of the new century then is to maintain the empirical tradition . At the university level , this calls for a philosophy of the authentically experiential to counteract the deleterious effects of excessive theory , one which asks , for example : What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never directly experienced his subject : such as that of a Marxist who has never experienced the effects of communism on his own body ? And as all the new technologies begin to predominate and impose new conditions on our lives we need to ask once again those age-old humanist questions on the most basic level : What is reality ? What is the purpose of each individual human life ? At present , American universities are not equipped for this challenging task , because the narrowness of ideological conformity , combined with an uncautious trust in technology , that characterizes the once best of them from Stanford on the West Coast to Harvard and Yale in the East , makes any factual exploration of these questions close to impossible . This is because the empirical epistemological tools that are the hard-won fruits of Western philosophy and culture are now being openly disavowed , if not totally demonized , by the anti-enlightenment forces inside Western culture itself . So strong is the attack on empiricism that not even the " hard " sciences are spared , as the spectacular Allan Sokal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anti-Western cultural revisionism is that it is not at all an American homegrown phenomenon , but paradoxically a European import . It is actually a by-product of a long tradition in European civilization , which has always been accompanied , as by a Jungian shadow , by elements of nihilistic philosophy , always lurking and poised to erupt in times of crises . Goethe , a wise European , ingeniously summed it up in the character of Mephistopheles : " I am the spirit that always negates , " ( Faust I , line 1338 , my translation ) . As such , it was imported to America in a moment of spiritual weakness , of Faustian soul-searching , during the Vietnam War upheavals when many here were ready to listen to gifted Mephistophelian pied pipers from Europe . It is a spirit of doctrinaire hardness , forged in the harsher climate of an older civilization , and immeasurably amplified by the massive bitterness , inhumanity , and suffering of twentieth-century Old World events from which my own family were refugees . For the more individualistic , optimistic , newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has never experienced misery on that scale ( no , not even the 9/11-trauma comes close ) , it is simply not practical . <p> Stepping out of the conference halls in Washington , I felt once again the fresh breath of reality . Fortunately , we are in a profession the consequences of whose works are mercifully not immediately evident in the outside world . These are the liberal arts , after all , reasonably detached from immediate material impact . In Washington , the MLA-buses still ran smoothly , regardless of what was being said inside the halls of the convention . Their drivers strove to be on schedule and did not insist on " indeterminacy . " Passengers happily crowded in without suffering from " contiguity disorder . " And could one imagine a traffic system that was culturally determined , with separate traffic lanes and traffic signs for black , white , gay , straight , feminist , or male chauvinist cultures ? And speaking of traffic , would you entrust your car to a " deconstructionist " mechanic ? Finally , on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " commodity fetishism " at Washington 's classier stores , and counting their change without complaining about " empirical bias . " <p> On the last day of the convention , I decided to explore the authentic Washington , this city named for a deserving individual who acted in tune with the demands of his time , admittedly had luck on his side , and overall discharged himself of what he saw his historical responsibility with humane dignity . And yet , this is also the man whose achievements are now , against all facts , severely marginalized in a number of current history texts , as a result of an ideology heavily represented at the MLA . Truly , listening to many of the sessions , how many attendees at the convention would have liked to see this city renamed , imitating modern European examples , " Karl Marx City ? " Or perhaps more up-to-date and American : " Jamesontown ? " <p> My exploration of Washington took place in the most authentic way possible -- on foot . The city is actually a government island surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from the center in many directions , one can soon very easily find oneself in a neighborhood that is predominantly African American . Indeed , after one lengthy bracing walk , I clearly seemed to be the only Caucasian within immediate sight . Stopping in the cold crisp air for a hot coffee , I chanced to exchange some conversation with the cashier , smiled , and received a smile in return : A splendidly ordinary encounter ! And as I stood on the sidewalk , relishing the steam from my cup rising in the cold air , it suddenly occurred to me : What if others had done what I had just done ? What if the thousands of devoted cultural theorists , with their cultural sensibilities honed to the nth degree , had on this almost final day of the millennium dropped their academic stand-offishness , fanned out over this significant city , and just once made actual practical contact with the objects of their sympathy , a simple , human , non-dogmatic , nonpolitical contact ? What a sensation ! Could one have imagined the possible news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spectacular Practice . " " Whispers of Millennial Fraternization . " " Alle Menschen werden Brder ? " <p> But it did not happen . A once-a-millennium opportunity had come and gone . And the cold hung heavy over Washington . The Fall 2003 Newsletter of the University of Michigan 's Program in American Culture describes the current research of assistant professor Nadine Naber . <p> Dr. Naber is also developing her dissertation , " Arab San Francisco : On Gender , Cultural Citizenship , and Belonging , " into a book manuscript . The book locates Arab American identities at the intersections of hegemonic U.S. nationalisms and Arab cultural re-authenticity , a term she coined to refer to the gendered and sexualized nationalist discourses produced in the context of bourgeoisie Arab immigrant politics . Dr. Naber 's book highlights diasporic Arab identities as sites for contesting the forces of assimilation , acculturation , and racism , while exposing a variety of oppositional locations ( such as queer Arab , Muslim student activism , inter-racial dating/marriage and radical Arab feminism ) that are often rendered invisible by the neo-colonialist discourses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 
##4000552 This is a tale about impairment of academic freedom that I experienced while teaching in the MBA program of a respected business school . The management department chair restricted my use of Saul Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals ( n1 ) in a course called Conflict and Negotiation . The political correctness movement has come full circle when it restricts the use of books , like Alinsky 's , that advocate civil rights . Because of this self-contradiction , I conclude that left-wing diversity advocates are just point men and women for university administrations aiming to make universities more market driven . <p> My claim is that political correctness furthers the marketing and molding of universities to what Thorstein Veblen calls pecuniary purposes in two ways. ( n2 ) First , political correctness itself constitutes a production goal that forestalls a less manageable target , namely academic freedom . Once in the door , the more manageable political correctness target can be transformed into other market-driven targets , and likely will be . In our free economy , institutional survival depends on meeting market demand efficiently , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political choice , market responsiveness will in the end replace it . <p> Second , the replacement of academic freedom with political correctness helps to teach students that the efficiency of conformity ought to trump costly free inquiry and debate . In turn , reflexive conformity makes MBA graduates ever more marketable to corporations , which benefit from it . Fear of disagreeing with politically correct ideas is good training for the workplace . MBA graduates who are psychologically compliant reduce firms ' training and turnover costs . In turn , the inculcation of conformity has become a key goal in MBA programs , which increasingly mandate uniformity and predictability in instructional methods . <p> But nonconformity and variation are sine qua non for academic dialogue . The reason is that instruments can not be refined to measure and control the uncontrollable . Creative dialogue or idle curiosity , as Veblen put it , can not be managed as a production process . Combine the incapacity to measure true academic quality with asymmetry in power between university administrations and faculties , and application of pecuniary purposes and total quality management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> George Ritzer colorfully terms the process of introducing efficiency , calculability , predictability and control into a wide range of social institutions McDonaldization , because the pattern echoes McDonald 's standardization of its menu and processes. ( n3 ) Efficiency , calculability , predictability and control minimize unpleasantness and risk . Much as amusement parks provide a safer alternative to trips abroad , so the establishment of quality targets causes education to be watered down , for example , through preferences for safely standardized text books and the full-scale standardization of courses . In MBA students ' post-1984 undergraduate education , ethics , diversity , conflict and morality must come , as Ritzer puts it , pre-sliced , pre-cut and pre-prepared , or else dialogue threatens therapeutic targets important to sensitive markets . Warning labels on offensive ideas need to be provided . Such narrowly defined customerization is of course inconsistent with academic freedom , but entirely in line with political correctness . <p> It was enough that several students found Alinsky 's book to be racist even though Alinsky was writing about his activities as a civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood or read the book . One student complaint was enough for the chair to encourage me to limit my using it in the classroom , for in a McDonaldized business school the customer is always right . Context <p> During the summer of 2002 , I taught as an adjunct professor in the full-time MBA program of a respected business school in which I have taught intermittently since 1996 . Different from the recent past , when I have taught as an adjunct in the evening program ( where the students are somewhat older and are currently working ) , this semester I was teaching in the full-time program , where the young-adult MBA students graduated from college in the late 1990s and seek jobs similar to the jobs that the evening students already have . <p> Adjunct teaching in the MBA program has from time to time supplemented income from my full-time teaching career at Brooklyn College , a component of the City University of New York . Although I have taught as a part-time adjunct in the MBA program for seven years ( with student ratings evidencing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for changes among MBA students since I last taught in the full-time program in the late 1990s . <p> The course I was teaching , Conflict and Negotiation , arises from the work of labor relations scholars , who argue that there are several kinds of negotiation , most importantly the integrative and distributive . In integrative negotiation , the parties aim to expand the opportunity set , and in distributive , the parties aim to divide the spoils . Saul Alinsky and Rules for Radicals <p> The incident involved the reading I assigned from Saul Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . The book is about Alinsky 's experiences as a civil rights agitator. ( n4 ) <p> In the 1940s , Alinsky was active in the Back-of-the-Yards neighborhood of Chicago , the setting of Upton Sinclair 's The Jungle. ( n5 ) In his organization work he encouraged the joint efforts of youth groups , businesses , and churches , and emphasized the resolution of hostilities among working class ethnic groups . He worked closely with striking stockyard workers , who were associated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis as well as the Catholic Church . Building on ideas he learned from Lewis , he formed the Industrial Areas Foundation in which he refined his organizational tactics . In the 1940s , he wrote Reveille for Radicals , which codified his ideas and was a bestseller. ( n6 ) Alinsky emphasized that organizers could facilitate , but that local people had to lead . His concepts constitute a potential solution to the breakdown in pluralism and the emergence of the brokerage of special interest groups that economists , political scientists , and journalists have pondered with distress . <p> In the 1950s , Alinsky became involved in organizing African American communities , and helped to create the Temporary Woodlawn Organization , which was the " first time that a black community in Chicago had , through sheer political power , won a major role in shaping an important urban-renewal program . " ( n7 ) After his departure from the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council , Alinsky attempted to counteract the racism that emerged in this and other working class white community organizations by proposing quota systems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since been termed affirmative action. ( n8 ) Then , in 1965 , Alinsky was invited to Rochester to help organize a civil rights protest movement against Eastman Kodak . These later civil rights activities are discussed in Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . <p> In his analysis of race relations and the civil rights movement , Charles E. Silberman writes of Alinsky : <p> Alinsky has been attacked at various times as a communist , a fascist , a dupe of the Catholic Church , the mastermind of a Catholic conspiracy ( Alinsky is Jewish ) , a racist , a segregationist , and an integrationist seeking to mongrelize Chicago . His supporters are equally immoderate in their praise. ( n9 ) <p> What better author to include in a course called Conflict and Negotiation ? Classroom Incident <p> In discussing Alinsky 's ideas on conflict , in which I mentioned his activities in labor and community organizing and did not mention any race issues , a student privately raised a concern with me during the class break that Alinsky was a racist . I replied that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rules for Radicals is about Alinsky 's civil rights activism , but I would be happy to discuss her concerns during class time if she would raise them in class . She agreed to raise them . <p> My suggestion of an open discussion reflected my concern for academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas . My approach was consistent with the university 's policy " Academic Freedom and Tenure " which appears in the Faculty Handbook that was first adopted more than forty years ago . According to the handbook : <p> Academic freedom is essential to the free search for truth and its free expression . . Freedom in teaching is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student in learning . Academic freedom imposes distinct obligations on the teacher . . Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject , but they should not introduce into their teaching controversial matter that has no relation to their subject . <p> Indeed , the American Association of University Professors ' 1967 Statement on Rights and Freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry and expression " in the classroom . Furthermore , " students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion . " ( n10 ) In fact , I make it a policy to reward students with extra credit toward their grades when they disagree with me in class or in their written assignments , and I did so in this case . The courage to debate is among the highest virtues . It seemed to me instinctively , and continues to upon reflection , that open debate is the best and most tolerant way to handle a student 's concern . <p> In explaining her view to the class , the student referred to an indented quote in the chapter on tactics ( 136 ) , which follows 135 pages of Alinsky 's discussions of his activities in civil rights protests and other politically correct social action . In the indented quote , Alinsky describes a tactic in which African American victims of housing discrimination picket to get " Jones " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slum landlord 's residence . Their picket signs , which said , " Did you know that Jones , your neighbor , is a slum landlord ? " were completely irrelevant ; the point was that the pickets knew Jones would be inundated with phone calls from his neighbors . <p> Jones : Before you say a word let me tell you that those signs are a bunch of lies ! <p> Neighbor : Look , Jones , I do n't give a damn what you do for a living . All we know is that you get those goddam niggers out of here or you get out ! <p> Jones came out and signed . <p> The student indicated that Alinsky 's use of the " n-word " in this context suggested racism on his part . She said that she had " shown the passage to her roommate and other friends and they had agreed that the passage was racist . " <p> I told the student that she had considerable courage to raise the issue , but that given the context in which the book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fight with racism , that Alinsky wrote in a period that was rife with racism , and that much of Rules for Radicals was about his experiences in fighting discrimination , I did not agree that Alinsky 's book expressed any racism . <p> The student then replied that there were many students in the class who would n't understand the context in which Alinsky wrote because they were from foreign countries . " The book is full of racism . For instance , he uses the word ghetto instead of blighted urban area , " she argued . <p> I replied that such terminology did n't likely exist in Alinsky 's day , and it did n't make sense to ask him to use politically correct bureaucratese from the 1990s . " If we limit ourselves to books written in the 1990s , we will be stuck with Gwyneth Paltrow , " I said sarcastically . I became frustrated as I sensed that the student had scanned the book for political incorrectness after noticing that Alinsky was writing about race issues . <p> As we discussed the topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a few of whom had read the book , disagreed with her . Several of her fellow students made suggestions about how to accommodate the student 's concerns . One suggestion was that I should warn future classes that the " n-word " is in the book in advance of assigning it . <p> Another student , however , supported an outright ban and said that , " the business school should n't be teaching racist material . " <p> I replied that , as far as I knew , I was the only instructor who uses Rules for Radicals in the business school ( it is used elsewhere in the university ) and that under ordinary standards of academic freedom , instructors ' choices in teaching are independent of the university 's policies . <p> I was surprised that the class as a whole was unaware of basic concepts of academic freedom and was unwilling to express views that differed from the politically correct one . In the post-1984 university , an accusation of racism is tantamount to a conviction ; for anyone , including an instructor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is racist automatically condemns the arguer . My students , educated in post-1984 elite universities , knew this better than I did . <p> As a postmodern business instructor , I am responsive to group dynamics ( that is my field , more or less ) and so I agreed to consider warning the class before assigning the book again . I also said that I would consider dropping Saul Alinsky from future teaching altogether because the book might be too " advanced . " I said this despite feeling in my gut that I was compromising academic freedom and pedagogic standards . <p> I also mentioned that the film Harlan County , USA , that we were to watch during the next class , also includes the " n-word " just as Alinsky uses it -- in depicting a racist opponent . <p> The young woman who raised the issue was one of three African American students in the class of about forty students . One of the other two said that he was n't bothered by the word 's being in the book but he agreed with the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the word 's being in the book before assigning the book in the future . <p> After class , a young woman ( and later two other students ) privately told me that many students had disagreed that Rules for Radicals is racist and that the book " definitely should not be dropped . " I asked her why she and her camp did not voice this view during the class discussion , and she replied that they were afraid of being accused of racism . <p> I had never before met this level of fear of expressing opinions in a classroom . Nor had I previously heard students make claims that reflected such a poverty of understanding of basic concepts of academic freedom . Students were unaware that my views as a professor were separate from those of the university . The political correctness movement seems to have done a hatchet job on awareness of academic freedom . The degree of fear , conformity , and lack of awareness of the academic process is something I had not encountered before , at the business school or anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and shown Harlan County , USA three times at Brooklyn College , where about 20 percent of my students are African Americans ( Brooklyn College is wonderfully diverse ) , as well as four previous times at the business school , without prior incident or complaint . <p> The course proceeded largely without incident . When the semester ended , the third black student in the class , an African diplomat attending the business school full time , approached me privately and , thanking me profusely , said that this was the best single course he had taken while at the business school . Meeting with the Department Chair <p> At the end of the semester , but before I submitted the final grades , the departmental chair summoned me to her office to offer me future summer teaching at the business school ( which I went on to do ) . After inquiries about possible teaching arrangements and my teaching interests , she told me that the Conflict and Negotiation course was to be redesigned into a half-semester module and that it was to become a required course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sections would now consist of identical content . In other words , Conflict and Negotiation was to be McDonaldized . <p> After discussing reappointment , the chair surprised me by changing the subject entirely . She raised the Saul Alinsky complaint . She told me that a ( white ) student , not the student who had first raised the issue in class , had come to her office to complain that I had been teaching from a racist book . The chair told me that she had asked the student to show her the racist book , and was surprised when she saw that it was Alinsky 's Rules for Radicals . She told me that she had read the book as an undergraduate in a political science course at an Ivy League university and that Alinsky was " Mr. Civil Rights . " She said that she had been astonished that the student thought that Alinsky was a racist . She told me that the student had then told her that the " n-word " had appeared in the text . She proceeded to ask me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Following , as it did , immediately after a discussion of contract renewal , the implication was , of course , that " doing something about it " was related to contract renewal . I was surprised and angered about the question , but responded as carefully as I could , as I wanted the contract to be renewed . I also was surprised that the chair seemed to be unconcerned about this student 's adoption of a Red Guard-style informant role , a role style that the political correctness movement seems to have encouraged among post-1984 graduates . <p> I asked the chair whether she really had read the book , and she replied that she had . She added that she understood what I was doing in the course , and that Alinsky 's tactics involved throwing opponents ' book of rules back at them in a conflict situation . She made it clear that she did not seriously believe that Alinsky 's book was racist . <p> I retorted that then she must understand why I found it hard to believe that the student who complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word appeared on page 136 in an indented quote , I scarcely knew it was there , and how could someone have found the word without having grasped the book 's meaning ? <p> She answered , " Well , maybe you did n't assign the part of the book that explained Alinsky 's views . " In fact , I had assigned the entire book , but said in class that the students should emphasize the chapters on ethics and tactics in their reading . Might not a student read more completely before complaining above my head ? Anyway , Alinsky 's point of view is evident from those two chapters alone . <p> The chair then added , accusingly , " You discussed racial issues in class , and some explanation is needed . " <p> I replied that I did not bring up racial issues . Maybe I had made a mistake in asking the student to discuss the matter openly , but that seemed like the right thing to do ( it still does ) . The student had raised the issue , and so the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't upset with the way the discussion went , " I said . <p> The chair rejoined , shaking her head and adopting the tone of a child therapist scolding an inept parent , " Well , she did feel uncomfortable -- for the rest of the semester . Maybe it was n't a good idea to discuss the subject . " <p> I repeated that she had come to me with a complaint , and we discussed it in the class , spending forty minutes on her point . I was n't sure what else I could have done . <p> She then said in an exasperated tone , " You have to understand that we attract so few black students here in a city that has a large black population and we need to worry about their concerns . " <p> I agreed that the small number of African American students in the business school was a cause for concern . <p> The chair again asked , " What do you plan to do about the complaint ? Have you thought about warning the class in advance ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the students had suggested doing that . But perhaps I 'll just drop the book altogether . I am not interested in a to-do . There are plenty of alternative books that cover conflict and distributive negotiation tactics . " It had become obvious to me that no matter what I said , I stood accused ( hence convicted ) of racism . If I capitulated and agreed , then I would be able to make amends . If I continued to argue , then I would stand accused and possibly lose the thousands of dollars of salary for two summer classes . <p> When I said that I would drop the book , the chair nodded approvingly and smiled . " Oh , you 're thinking of dropping it . Good , " she concluded , adding that she had another meeting to attend . Conclusion <p> Perhaps the chair was concerned that I had been insufficiently responsive , insufficiently therapeutic , and not customer targeted . Remember , not a single racist word was uttered by anyone in the class . The sole issue was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other elaborate ideologies , political correctness is easily misinterpreted and transmuted , and the dictates of managerial expediency make misinterpretation a certainty . Administrators ' needs for power and their overriding concerns with maximizing endowments and tuition revenues guarantee that subtle arguments about speech codes will be easily forgotten . <p> The chair responded to a student 's misguided complaint by restricting my teaching and creating a rule that could not have possibly reflected an underlying concern for racist speech . Ultimately , and perhaps unconsciously , her response was a market-driven one . She believes that certain target markets are under-exploited ; she received a complaint from a member of that target market ; and she called on me to help resolve the marketing and quality problem . Sadly , such a pattern tends to replicate itself . As administrators institute control in the name of political correctness , the McDonaldization of higher education proceeds apace . Courses will be standardized and speech codes implemented . The McDonaldized institutions arising from the patterns that political correctness has instigated will remain in place long after the race issue has been forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##4000553 Grutter <p> As of this writing the response by conservatives , classical liberals , and constitutional and academic traditionalists to the revolutionary Grutter v. Bollinger decision continues to be stunningly weak , even as the dominant liberal culture is presenting the decision 's redefinition of America as a fait accompli . It is notable , for example , that in a list of elements constituting " the core of a civil society as understood in the West " that America hopes to install in Iraq , reporter John Burns of the New York Times includes " entrenched individual and group rights " ( emphasis added ) , a formula that would have been inconceivable prior to the Grutter decision . New York Times , 14 December 2003 , " There Is No Crash Course in Democracy . " <p> One factor that might explain the lack of effective conservative protest against Grutter is that in the same week that the decision was handed down , along with its companion decision in Gratz v. Bollinger , the Supreme Court also issued its landmark ruling in Lawrence v. Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules , " First Things ( October 2003 ) , devotes the better part of his attention to Lawrence and , although he deplores the decision in Grutter , does not grapple with its implications . Commentary published a symposium , " Has the Supreme Court Gone Too Far ? " ( October 2003 ) , which also takes both Lawrence and the affirmative action decisions under purview , with some respondents focusing mainly on the former . Strong entries come from William Bennett , Robert Bork , and Lino Graglia , but the overall tone of the symposium is disconcertingly mild , featuring as it does a number of legal experts who see no problem with Grutter whatsoever , as well as a number of past affirmative action opponents who unaccountably fail to argue with any urgency against it here . The overall impression is that Grutter is just another regrettable Supreme Court decision , like many others we have had over the years , and not something of any particular significance . The casual attitude is also suggested by the symposium 's title : " Has the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . On the other hand , Carl Cohen in the letters section of the January Commentary presents a superb refutation of the arguments supporting " diversity . " <p> Another possible factor in the anemic conservative and traditionalist response to Grutter is that racial preference opponents , never having imagined that the Court would actually inject racial discrimination into the United States Constitution , were simply confounded by the decision and did n't know how to reply . ( As Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissent , previous Supreme Court findings permitting racial preferences had been on narrow , specific grounds . ) Thus the stalwart Stanley Kurtz confesses that " after the Michigan decisions , the battle seemed lost and I did n't have the heart to look into the matter any further . " But he goes on to say hopefully , " I was wrong . . We opponents of affirmative action have only lost that battle if we think we 've lost . Look closely at the Michigan decisions and you 'll see any number of ways in which we can still pare back -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kurtz 's argument hinges on the expectation that large schools will find it inordinately hard to attain the desired group proportionality without recourse to the more blatant forms of racial preference that were repudiated by the Court in Gratz . " Affirmative Signs : Preferences Wo n't Be on Campus Forever , " NRO ( 17 November 2003 ) . Peter Kirsanow makes a similar point . " Still Unconstitutional , " NRO ( 30 September 2003 ) . <p> Yet another possible factor in the passive response to Grutter is simple denial , namely the inability of those who have staked a large part of their intellectual capital on their vision of America as a country " dedicated to a proposition " to accept that the proposition has been radically altered to encompass group rights . Finally , for more than a few , there is the perceived need to avoid a divisive political battle over civil rights while the country is in the midst of a contentious war on terror and is attempting to rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq . It is important to keep in mind , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law fails here , in perhaps the most optimal conditions on the face of the earth and in the history of man , and must be buttressed by group guarantees in order to pacify various minorities , it can scarcely be hoped that the Experiment will succeed in primitive countries with far less developed common cultures and traditions of citizenship than our own . <p> Even without undertaking arduous legal battles , it is important for adherents of individual rights not to let themselves lapse into silence , but to be crystal clear about what has happened and to keep it before the public mind . In this regard , one heartening sign of energy in the anti-racial preference camp is , of all things , the Affirmative Action Bake Sale movement , supported by Alan Kors 's Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and run by courageous young " cookie rebels " who are keeping the controversy alive on campuses throughout the country . Numerous articles on the bake sales can be found on the web , and a good summary is offered by Wendy McElroy , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Certainly the pro-racial preference forces have not been resting on their laurels . On the contrary , they have been been busy as bees dissecting the potentialities of Grutter and planning their next steps . An organization with the belligerently thuggish name By Any Means Necessary , devoted the plenary session of its national conference to " Our Tasks for the Next Period " on 8 November 2003 . Harvard University sponsored a forum called " Moving Beyond the Supreme Court Decisions " on 31 October-1 November 2003 . The Jurist , an unofficial website emanating from the law school at the University of Pittsburgh , featured " The University of Michigan Affirmative Action Admissions Cases : A Jurist Online Symposium . " Echoing Justice O'Connor 's climactic passage in Grutter , these discussions all stressed the need to extend affirmative action beyond the university into virtually every area of society , including housing , the workplace , and the professions , and to defeat any and all individual civil rights initiatives , such as the one being promoted by Ward Connerly in the state of Michigan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part by Bill Lann Lee , former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Clinton administration : <p> " Our responsibility as educators can not end with admitting a diverse student body . . We also need to make sure that the process begun in college and law school carries through to the workplace . . We need to ask , as responsible bar associations and legal employers are doing , why we do n't have more nonwhite judges and law firm partners . We need to inquire about the climate for nonwhite lawyers in their workplaces , in court , and with clients . As leaders of our communities , we also need to take responsibility for the discrimination in housing , education , and the workplace that surrounds us all . Prejudice is individual , but the best tools for combating bias are collective . <p> The symposium also features critics of Grutter , such as Peter Schuck , author of Diversity in America : Keeping Government at a Safe Distance ( Belknap Press , 2003 ) .

After an astute and comprehensive summary-analysis of what has gone wrong in the contemporary university , Hanson declares that students today " are more than ever questioning their professors ' ideology , " and therefore concludes that " much of our present academic pathology is the cargo of a particular generation , one that is slowly making its way out of the university . Its influence is felt most acutely today as it reaches the apex of power , but as this generation nursed on campus protest passes -- and it soon will -- there is reason to hope that it may not have replicated itself and so will be remembered as a sad artifact of our recent history . " Would that it were so , but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have discovered again and again that reports of the demise of the degraded academy have turned out to be quite premature . In fact , this too hopeful attitude may well be responsible for the complacent dismissal on the part of many conservatives and conservative institutions of the significance of recent academic trends and their effect on our society as a whole , as factors contributing to increasing passivity in the face of the politically correct agenda . Scholarship <p> In Proust , Mann , Joyce in the Modernist Context ( Catholic University of America Press , 2003 ) , Gerald Gillepsie , Professor Emeritus at Stanford and past president of the International Comparative Literature Association , argues provocatively that these three giants of twentieth-century literature transcend modernist fragmentation and discontinuity to attain holistic vision .

##4000556 23 June 2003 was a dark day for the United States of America . On that day the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Grutter v. Bollinger , allowing preferences in admissions to the University of Michigan Law School based on race and ethnicity and for the purported goal of securing the educational benefits of diversity , a purpose deemed a " compelling state interest " by the Court . Writing for the majority , Justice O'Connor accepted the Law School 's claim that a " critical mass " of minority students had been achieved not through quotas but through " individualized review , " even though the number of minorities accepted each year exactly tracked their various proportions of the admissions pool , as was pointed out in the dissent written by Chief Justice Rehnquist . <p> On the same day , in Gratz v. Bollinger , the Court disallowed the automatic awarding of bonus admissions points to minorities in Michigan 's undergraduate division as constituting a quota system . This hardly compensated for Grutter , however , which effectively overrides the Fourteenth Amendment and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the bedrock of the American ideal . ( See Edward J. Erler , " The Michigan Affirmative Action Cases : An Historical Perspective , " Imprimis , September 2003 . ) The following are some of the notable responses from opponents of racial preferences . A number of them appeared in National Review and National Review Online . Both have shown an especial and welcome interest in this crucial discussion . ( See the editorial , " Travesty : The Court Failed to Do Its Duty , " National Review , 14 July 2003 . ) <p> " Not in my most nightmarish speculation about what the Court might do regarding these cases did I envision that the justices of the highest court in the land would actually accord ' diversity ' not only equivalent status to the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , but to make the latter subordinate to the former , " writes Ward Connerly ( " Murder at the Supreme Court , " National Review Online , 26 June 2003 ) . He continued , " Let it be said that when given a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 2003 five justices consigned them to another generation -- or , perhaps , a term of indefinite duration -- of virtual enslavement to the past . " <p> Another commentator who sees the dire implications of the decision is Peter Wood ( " Affirming Faction , " National Review Online , 27 June 2003 ) . Wood lamented the " bad news , " adding ominously that " just how bad it is has yet to register with many people . " <p> Wood 's observation is borne out by Peter Kirsanow ( " Michigan Impossible : Grutter compliance may be a problem , " National Review Online , 1 July 2003 ) , who reports that a " review of post-Michigan commentary reveals a gathering consensus among conservatives to just ' move on . ' " Kirsanow paraphrases the thoughts of his conservative colleagues : " We fought the good fight and lost -- maybe it 's time to take a different tack , such as racial-privacy initiatives , and hey , if they do n't fly , maybe in 25 years it 'll all be over anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only because of the naivete regarding what was merely a tentative , toothless suggestion of a 25 year limit to affirmative action on the part of the Court in Grutter . Even more astounding is the bland complacency with which these conservatives countenance the obviation of the " proposition " that " all men are created equal , " the proposition that many conservatives ( and liberals too ) have insisted constitutes the very definition of America . Now that the " proposition " has been overruled , one would have expected widespread alarm rather than the kind of supine quiescence that Kirsanow reports . <p> Marcia Coyle ( " Battle Over Affirmative Action Expected to Expand , " The National Law Journal , 11 July 2003 ) , quotes the reaction of Michael Greve of the American Enterprise Institute and co-founder of the Center for Individual Rights , the organization that led the battle against race-based admissions policies in Texas , Washington , and Michigan . " I just think this was a complete wipeout , " Greve declared . <p> " What happens in the litigation community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum up money for this and harder to persuade people this is a righteous fight . I personally would not think there 's enough oomph behind this movement now to say , ' Let 's hold the Supreme Court to what it pretended to be saying , ' " that is , insistence on " narrow tailoring " and " individualized review " of all applicants . <p> Abigail Thernstrom , quoted in the same article , agrees : " It 's a total defeat . It really does n't matter if there is a Supreme Court resignation . This is a momentous decision rewriting the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court is not going to overturn precedent with abandon because there is a new justice . " <p> Unfortunately , the estimable Greve may himself be partly responsible for helping to craft the CIR platform against affirmative action that failed to convince the Court . ( Although the purported educational benefits of diversity had been challenged in friend-of-the-court briefs , these were not part of the plaintiff 's own arguments . ) In an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is on the Rocks , " 20 April 2001 ) , Greve accepted the importance of diversity as an educational ideal but endeavored to show that affirmative action is not needed in order to obtain it . CIR 's legal affairs director , Curt Levey , wrote a similar article ( " Diversity on Trial , " National Review Online , 11 June 2001 ) . They both suggested lowering standards for all applicants , de-emphasizing objective criteria like SAT scores , and , as Greve put it , employing " individualized file review that makes it impossible to trace racial discrimination . " <p> John J. Miller ( " ' Diversity ' . D'oh ! " National Review , 28 July 2003 ) argues that CIR made a mistake in relying only on equal protection and the consequent unconstitutionality of race preferences and in not challenging the validity of diversity as an educational ideal in itself . Miller cites Peter Wood : " I say this more in sadness than in anger , but CIR made a tactical error " in not confronting " the diversity argument . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPI Legal Affairs Correspondent ( in a UPI release published on 25 July 2003 ) : " The whole idea of diversity as a compelling state interest was not litigated . . They believed they could win on a 14th Amendment ( equal protection ) analysis . " <p> Nevertheless , not everyone is ready to give up . Miller suggests some strategies for resistance , and in the same issue of National Review in which Miller 's article appears , John O'Sullivan ( " Affirmative Action Forever ? " ) outlines some ways in which opposition to affirmative action might arise , one of them being that continued mass immigration will bring the proportion of the minorities eligible for preferences to over half the population in the coming decades , thus greatly increasing the burden on the unprivileged groups . <p> For his part , Kirsanow , a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights , believes that " Michigan renders preference programs extremely vulnerable to legal assault . " And the CIR is ready to continue the fight . Curt Levey is quoted in the Coyle article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a lot of litigation on the narrow tailoring grounds . The Court said you ca n't use race in a mechanical way and it should not be a decisive factor . Those are vague terms so we 're going to have to litigate in the lower courts to make sure that is a meaningful distinction and our victory in Gratz is not for nothing . " <p> Taking a different tack , Ward Connerly has begun a Civil Rights Initiative in the state of Michigan to outlaw racial discrimination and preferences in public institutions . ( " Taking it to Michigan : Announcing the ' Michigan Civil Rights Act , ' " National Review Online , 8 July 2003 ) <p> Unfortunately , Henry Payne ( " Putting Preferences to a Vote , " National Review Online , 10 July 2003 ) , is obliged to report the thuggish behavior displayed by preference supporters during the press conference at which Connerly introduced the measure . Payne 's article also exposes the sense of absolute , apodictical entitlement on the part of minorities that affirmative action has encouraged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Choice : Michigan Republicans Confront Ward Connerly , " National Review Online , 17 July 2003 ) , gives a dispiriting reminder that President Bush and the GOP support diversity as racial proportionality and will oppose such state initiatives as Connerly is sponsoring as " divisive . " Despite the fact that his administration actually argued against Michigan 's admissions policies in both cases , President Bush declared after the decisions were handed down : " Today 's decisions seek a careful balance between the goal of campus diversity and the fundamental principle of equal treatment under the law . " Additional responses to Grutter <p> Carl Cohen ( " Winks , Nods , Disguises -- and Racial Preferences , " Commentary , September 2003 ) . The man who first exposed Michigan 's discriminatory admissions practices and expresses his consternation and surprise that the Supreme Court has given constitutional validity to racial discrimination . <p> John Perazzo ( " Rewarding the Unqualified " Frontpagemagazine.com , 3 July 2003 ) illustrates the large disparities in qualifications between the preferred and the non-preferred groups admitted to various selective schools . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grutter , " National Review Online , 1 August 2003 ) draws attention to the little noted dissent of Justice Kennedy in Grutter . Unlike the other dissenters , notably Justices Scalia and Thomas , Kennedy is a firm supporter of affirmative action who nevertheless found that " the concept of critical mass is a delusion used by the Law School to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas . " <p> In an exchange of letters in the New York Review of Books ( 14 August 2003 ) , Stanley Rothman and Ronald Dworkin discuss Rothman 's recent survey countering the claim that diversity enhances the educational experience .

##4002466 Key words : inquiry tasks for adolescents ; problem-centered social studies ; concerns and interests of young adults <p> At least since John Dewey published his classic works ( Dewey 1916 1938 ; 1933 ; 1938 1963 ) , teachers have been urged to engage students by using thinking and inquiry tasks that reflect real-world concerns and interests . Subsequent to the appearance of Dewey 's discussions of that pedagogical stance , the National Council for the Social Studies published The Problems Approach and the Social Studies in 1955 and issued a revised version , Problem-Centered Social Studies Instruction : Approaches to Reflective Teaching , in 1971 ( Gross and Muessig 1971 ) . More recently , social science education specialists published research-based theoretical articles providing scholarly justifications for the use of inquiry activities in social studies classes , especially activities that have students using the methods of social scientists ( Mayer 1998 ; VanSickle and Hoge 1991 ) . Since 1990 , authors of numerous articles have recommended the use of problem-centered instruction in secondary social studies classes ( e.g. , Benoit 1998 ; Gallagher 2000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes 1994 ) , including classes for students with learning disabilities ( O'Brien 2000 ) . During that period , other authors have recommended that for secondary social studies classes , teachers should consider a relative of problem-centered instruction -- the case method ( Guyer , Dillon , Anderson , and Szobota 2000 ; Wasserman 1992 ) . Other social science education experts writing on the promotion of thinking and inquiry about real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes have referred to " authentic instruction " ( Foster and Padgett 1999 ; Newmann 1990 ) . Still others have built their preferred methods around social issues ( Evans 1998 ; Rossi 1996 ; Shaver 1992 ) . At present , an entire book is in print on the use of cooperative problem-solving methods in secondary social studies classes ( Hickman and Wigginton 1999 ) . Another available book features the use of problem-based learning in social studies classes from the elementary grades through college ( Moye 1998 ) , and one is in print on the social issues approach ( Evans and Saxe 1996 ) . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers respond to John Dewey 's recommendation that teachers engage students by using thinking and inquiry tasks reflecting real-world concerns and interests . Challenges in Using Inquiry Methods <p> Widespread support for Dewey 's recommendation does not easily translate into widespread , sustained application of the recommendation , however . Researchers who have investigated the use of problem-centered instruction in social studies classes ( Ehman , Glenn , Johnson , and White 1992 ; Saye and Brush 1999 ) point to the time demands on students and teachers , the need for and frequent lack of relevant prior knowledge on the students ' part , and the importance of expert guidance for students during the problem-solving process , even when much guidance is built into computer-based activities . Even enthusiastic supporters of issues-oriented instruction in social studies classes point to the challenges faced by users of the approach ( Rossi 1995 ; Rossi and Pace 1998 ) . In fact , authors of recent articles focus specifically on ways to overcome barriers that discourage social studies teachers from applying inquiry methods centered on real-world concerns and interests ( Evans , Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like most of the authors cited above , we are firm believers in the use of thinking and inquiry tasks that reflect real-world concerns and interests and are committed users of such tasks in our university classrooms . Because of our interest in the method , we are disappointed to see the relative infrequency with which teachers use thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes . We recognize , however , that the ill-structured tasks meant to typify problem-based learning can create substantial instructional challenges for teachers . We recognize , too , that the controversial issues recommended for issues-centered instruction can create unpleasant conflict in teachers ' lives . <p> We believe , however , that many teachers can move toward the more complex forms of thinking and inquiry methods and those forms that more realistically simulate the actual work of social scientists . In many secondary social studies classes , the teachers may have to begin with thinking and inquiry tasks that are relatively modest in complexity and that perhaps require only textbook information and classroom time to carry them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not pretend to be historians , political scientists , or psychologists . In this article , we identify several types of thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on concerns or interests of adolescents but do so at varying levels of complexity and require students to use a range of informational resources . The types of tasks discussed are less complex than the ill-structured tasks recommended by proponents of problem-based learning and the case method , and the tasks put less demand on the thinking and investigation skills of students than the tasks typical of those two instructional approaches or of issues-centered instruction . <p> To begin our discussion , we must emphasize a fact of which veteran secondary teachers are fully aware : Anticipating whether a certain thinking or inquiry task will tap into a concern or interest of a specific adolescent is virtually impossible without knowing the individual very well . The available research on the concerns and interests of young adults may be reassuring for social studies teachers who have incorrectly predicted the effectiveness of a creatively constructed thinking or inquiry task with a certain secondary student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that the typical concerns and interests of young adults vary with their age ( Hendry , Glendinning , and Shucksmith 1996 ) , the influence of their parents and socioeconomic status ( Kasser , Ryan , Zax , and Sameroff 1995 ) , and societal circumstances ( Easterlin and Crimmins 1991 ; Ovadia 2003 ) . In short , no simple , unchanging guidelines can be developed for creating thinking and inquiry tasks that can reliably capitalize on concerns of specific secondary students . To design such tasks , teachers must draw on what they can learn about individual students and about specific groups of students . Tasks Reflecting Students ' Concerns and Interests <p> Despite that caveat , we present in figure 1 several types of tasks that can take advantage of the concerns or interests of adolescents . To understand the information in figure 1 fully , the reader must refer to the appendix of this article . We drew on our experiences with secondary students to identify the types of tasks and to construct the sample tasks illustrating those types . During the process of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1990 ) , " The Personal Relevance of the Social Studies , " in which he offers a " personal-relevance framework " by which he categorizes typical human goals . He sorts them first into four general motivations -- sense of security , sense of affiliation , sense of competence , and sense of influence -- and then into five areas of life -- human relationships , occupation , health and safety , personal development , and finances . Even after we had developed most of the suggested task types and examples , we found his framework helpful for creating additional thinking and inquiry tasks to tap into the concerns of adolescents . <p> The reader should examine the figure and the appendix before continuing with the article . We wrote the sample tasks using sentence structure and vocabulary that we assumed readers of The Social Studies would understand . For some secondary social studies classes , modifications in the sentence structure and vocabulary are needed . <p> We do not mean the types of uses of social studies content and the sample tasks that we present to be definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to illustrate the content uses on which social studies teachers can build instruction . The sample tasks need not be like academic or professional applications of course content or resemble academic or professional tasks . The tasks can have a personal use and have a high probability of being viewed as relevant to adolescents , even if the students are not concerned about the content as academic content . We are impressed by many of the thinking and inquiry tasks suggested in the teacher 's edition of current secondary social studies textbooks , but we find that most of the tasks involve uses that would seem realistic primarily to academic specialists in the subject area , to professionals in careers related to the subject area , or to students who are already intensely interested in the subject area . We believe that all students should be exposed to such uses but that they also should be allowed and enabled to see that social studies content can be used in ways that they recognize as relevant . Features of Effective Use of Inquiry Methods <p> We do not intend this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry tasks in secondary social studies classrooms . The articles and books we cited provide excellent discussions of that nature . We also recommend helpful articles and books with no specific subject area focus by Beamon ( 2002 ) , Fogarty ( 1997 ) , Lambros ( 2004 ) , Krynock and Robb ( 1999 ) , Renzulli ( 2000,2001 ) , Souders and Prescott ( 1999 ) , and Torp and Sage ( 2002 ) . Although we do not propose an overall framework for incorporating thinking and inquiry tasks into secondary social studies instruction , we suggest several features that are also recommended in the discussions of many experts on problem-based learning and related instructional approaches . One suggestion is that in secondary classrooms , small-group collaborative inquiry , rather than individual inquiry , often leads to better inquiry products and better learning . Collaboration usually capitalizes on the " five heads are better than one " phenomenon , which leads to high-quality inquiry products . Students in a small group can learn from others ' explanations of tasks , concepts , and larger ideas and from others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquiry tasks , teachers should offer options from which students can choose . For example , a teacher could include as options a selection of tasks from the teacher 's edition of the course textbook and several of the teacher-created tasks presented in this article . Allowing students to choose the tasks that they will carry out increases the chance that they will be interested in the topics , that they have the investigation skills needed for the tasks , and that they have useful prior knowledge . Those three circumstances can produce the motivation and capabilities required for successful task completion . Nevertheless , even when students work in groups on tasks involving topics of interest to them and on tasks for which they have relevant investigation skills and prior knowledge , they need to be monitored by the teacher to provide guidance and other support . <p> We believe that the successful use of thinking and inquiry tasks by a secondary social studies teacher who has not already incorporated problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , or a related approach into her or his classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to develop the requisite management skills and procedures before considering large-scale use of one of the approaches . Moreover , the students need to develop their thinking , investigation , and collaboration skills , which are essential for successful participation in the approaches . One reason we believe in the types of thinking and inquiry tasks presented in this article is that the teacher 's and student 's skills improve through such tasks and can eventually be applied to the types of tasks typically recommended by proponents of problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , and other inquiry approaches for social studies classes . Although the sample tasks presented here are low to moderate in complexity and in the demands placed on students ' thinking and investigation skills , the use of such types of tasks can lay the foundation for successful use of more complex and more demanding thinking and inquiry tasks .

##4002468 Key words : economics and September 11 , 2001 ; economics and terrorism ; economic approach to modern problems <p> To many Western observers , the behavior of people in the Middle East is a mystery . The area is the scene of brutality and seemingly senseless acts of violence . Why has there been so much turmoil there for so long ? A brief review of past events helps to establish the context of the problem . Partition of Palestine <p> The United Nations voted in 1947 to partition Palestine , the British mandate , into two states -- one for Jews and one for Palestinian Arabs . Through political pressure , the Jewish state assimilated large tracts of land belonging to Palestinians and through intimidation forced three hundred thousand Palestinian Arabs to leave their homes and land and to become refugees . <p> In 1948 , when the British gave up Palestine and the United Nations divided Palestine , Israel became an independent state . Palestinian refugees mounted protests in an attempt to get back their land and homes . Through the efforts of provocations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used its army to attack the Palestinian Arabs . Facing death , seven hundred thousand more Palestinians fled their homes and land in terror . Israel promptly announced that it would annex the newly vacated land as a part of the new nation . <p> Angered by that act by Israel , the neighboring Arab countries attacked Israel so that the seven hundred thousand Palestinian refugees could return to their homes and land . The five attacking countries were also former British colonies , and therefore their newly formed armies were ill equipped and poorly trained . By contrast , the United States was committed to the defense of Israel and gave Israel the military equipment and financial means to fight the war successfully . The Israeli forces prevailed in the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 . With the military victory of 1948 , Israel had the political advantage in negotiations over Palestine , and the 1 million displaced Palestinian Arabs became permanent refugees . <p> Angered and demoralized by the events of 1948 , the Arab League refused to recognize Israel as a state and demanded that all Palestine refugees be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Israel had the upper hand militarily and that the United States gave Israel $4 billion a year in military and financial aid , the Arab League recognized that the imbalance of power favoring Israel would remain indefinitely . Retaliation against Israel began to take different forms . Because of their frustration at the political advantage that Israel and the United States had in the region , protesters resorted to acts of terror , which became widespread in the Middle East . Other Events Affecting the Turmoil in the Middle East <p> In 1953 , the United States helped Iran 's military stage a coup , overthrowing the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq , whom the United States feared might be a communist threat . The United States then reinstalled the hated Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as the Shah of Iran . <p> In 1968 , Arab militants hijacked an El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv . That was followed by decades of hostage taking , hijackings , and assassinations , which characterized the strategy used by Arab militant groups . <p> In 1972 , eight Arab commandos from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Munich Olympic Games . <p> In 1973 , the Nixon administration provided Israel with the means of producing an atomic bomb . <p> In 1979 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led a revolution in Iran , overthrowing the U.S.-supported Shah of Iran and taking sixty-six Americans hostage for fifteen months . <p> In 1983 , a truck bomb exploded at the U.S. marine barracks in Lebanon , killing 241 soldiers . The United States subsequently withdrew from Lebanon . <p> After the Iranian Air Flight 655 with 290 passengers was accidentally shot down by the USS Vincennes missile cruiser in Iranian waters in 1986 , the crew of the Vincennes was rewarded with military medals for their bravery . <p> In 1993 , the World Trade Center in New York City was bombed , killing six . <p> In 1996 , a truck bomb exploded outside U.S. military barracks in Saudi Arabia . <p> In 1998 , bombs exploded outside U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . The United States linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden . <p> In 2000 , the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen 's Aden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . <p> On September 11 , 2001 , hijackers crashed two planes into the World Trade Center buildings in New York City , killing more than two thousand people , and another into the Pentagon , headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense . A fourth plane bound for either the White House or the Capitol crashed in Pennsylvania before reaching its target . The United States linked Osama bin Laden to the attack . An Economic Analysis <p> Those seem to be senseless acts . In many cases , the terrorists themselves died in the attack . How can such behavior be considered rational ? Explaining such behavior is troublesome if one teaches high school economics . After all , the most basic assumption of economics is that people act in their own best interest . Paul Heyne , well known for his textbook The Economic Way of Thinking , states : <p> The theories of economics , with surprisingly few exceptions , are simple extensions of the assumptions that individuals take those actions they think will yield them the largest net advantage . Everyone , it is assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spendthrift , saint or sinner , consumer or seller , politician or business executive , cautious calculator or spontaneous improviser. ( 1994,5 ) <p> It is nearly impossible to reconcile the behavior of terrorists with the behavior of the rational , self-interested individuals whom Heyne and many others associate with the economics approach . Should economics teachers suggest that economic theory applies to all sorts of people , at many times and across many cultures , but that some people in the Middle East are somehow a special class exempt from basic economic theory ? If people in the Middle East are not exempt from economic theory , what should a high school teacher say ? How would an economist approach the problem of Middle East terror ? Specifically , let us consider the events of September 11 , 2001 . How Were the Terrorists Organized and Financed ? <p> The al Qaeda network is headed by the Emir General ( Osama bin Laden ) and his immediate lieutenants , Ayman Al-Zawahiri ( al-Jihid ) and Mohammed Atef ( Military Operations ) . Other leaders have assigned roles in areas dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the media . The al Qaeda network is largely a decentralized operation , with individual terrorist cells playing key roles . <p> Al Qaeda has established several key alliances . Among the most important are the following : <p> -- Al-Jihad ( Egypt ) : assassination of Sadat in 1981 <p> -- Hamas ( West Bank/Gaza ) : ongoing attacks against Israel <p> -- Hezbollah ( Lebanon ) : bombing of the U.S. embassy in 1983 <p> -- GIA ( Algeria ) : planned millennium attacks <p> -- Harakat-al-Mujadi : completed terrorist actions in Pakistan <p> -- Abu-Sayyaf : completed terrorist actions in the Philippines <p> Al Qaeda could not survive without sources of funds and protection . Osama bin Laden was able to launch al Qaeda in part with funding from his own personal fortune and businesses , which have been estimated to be worth $150 million . ( Considering that al Qaeda likely spent no more than $200,000 on the entire September 11 operation , bin Laden 's fortune can support numerous acts of terrorism ) . To survive , al Qaeda and similar groups need the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can shelter them from apprehension and allow them to conduct business . Afghanistan and Iraq were widely regarded as states willing to harbor terrorist groups . Additional sources of funds come from Islamic charities and individual wealthy families in the Persian Gulf . Drug trafficking also contributed to al Qaeda 's income . Rational Behavior <p> The organization and finances of al Qaeda suggest that terrorist acts are planned by rational people who lead terrorist groups . Those leaders seek to benefit even while some of their followers are destroyed . They view their actions in much the same way as military leaders view war casualties -- as a price to be paid . <p> The organization and finances of al Qaeda also reveal that the actions of al Qaeda are influenced by the existence of goals . They are making choices that , given available information , they hope will go farthest toward achieving those ends . The long-term goals of al Qaeda include the following : <p> -- The liberation of Saudi Arabia and other countries from U.S. troops <p> -- The replacement of pro-Western regimes with militant Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Muslim control over holy places in Jerusalem <p> To accomplish its long-term goals , al Qaeda identified the United States as the primary enemy . Following its goal-orientated behavior , al Qaeda made meticulous plans , arranged for logistical support , and aimed for efficiency in its execution of specific acts of terrorism . It took several specific actions that were intended to destabilize the <p> U.S. economy and reduce U.S. influence in the Middle East . In that sense , then , the actions of terrorist groups such as al Qaeda appear to be rational rather than the result of some form of psychosis . Economic Analysis of Criminal Behavior <p> For a deeper understanding of the economics approach to terrorism , let us turn to related areas of economic theory and research . Economists for many years have studied human behavior in areas beyond the production of goods and services . Economists , for example , have studied behavior in such areas as dating , voting , fertility , obesity , racial discrimination , and criminal behavior . <p> We decided to examine how the economic analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts , after all , can be viewed as simply another form of criminal behavior . Terrorists , like other criminals , violate laws and hurt innocents as they pursue their aims . <p> Sociologists and other intellectuals have argued that the root causes of crime are to be found in such things as racism , poverty , discrimination , lack of jobs , and globalization . In that line of analysis , little can be done in the short term to change criminal behavior . Actions that should be taken include expanding the rights of the accused , reducing sentences , expanding probation , and tightening restrictions on police . <p> Gary S. Becker , the Nobel Prizewinning economist from the University of Chicago , approached the problem of criminal behavior differently . He applied the economic way of thinking to criminal behavior . Becker and Becker ( 1997 ) state that criminals , like everyone else , respond to incentives in predictable ways . For example , more college students go into computer science and chemical engineering when earnings and other advantages are rising in those fields . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . <p> Similarly , from the 1950s until the 1980s , more people were induced to commit crimes because they were responding to incentives . The incentive structure had changed to reward more criminal behavior . That was a period when judges issued less severe sentences and many convicted criminals never actually served time . As a result , crime became a more attractive " occupation . " <p> From his research , Becker concluded that ways had to be found to change incentives influencing criminal behavior . Becker and Becker ( 1997 ) point out that the revival of the economic analysis of crime led to actions that reduced crime levels . As the probabilities of apprehending criminals and punishing those convicted increased , crime began to decline . Studies revealed that crimes of passion as well as crimes against property were reduced by making punishment more certain and severe . <p> Becker 's studies can be applied to the behavior of terrorist groups such as al Qaeda . The key is to begin with a focus on incentives to terrorists . A case can be made that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives that rewarded terrorist behavior . The United States used almost no military response in the wake of several terrorist attacks , including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole . Groups such as al Qaeda watched the American response carefully . The lack of action provided an incentive to commit additional acts of terror . <p> Can swift and decisive action deter terrorism ? At first glance , common sense would suggest that that is the case . Empirical studies offer some additional specific evidence . Enders , Sandler , and Cauley ( 1990 ) studied the effects of metal detector technology on the number of skyjacking incidents . They found that the fall in transnational skyjacking was statistically significant after such technology was in place . <p> But the difficulty of applying direct retaliation as the complete solution to terrorist behavior lies within the nature of terrorism . In many acts of terrorism , the perpetrator is a suicide bomber . The planners and leaders are unknown or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty . Another way to approach incentives for terrorists is to deal directly with the root problems that cause the terrorism . For example , U.S. troops on the Muslim holy ground of Saudi Arabia have caused much of the animosity toward the United States ; so much so that the United States is very quietly removing U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia . Internationalizing the Old City of Jerusalem and all the holy shrines in Israel under the UN would be another step to ending a great deal of religious animosity and a major cause of terrorism . Why the World Trade Center Buildings and the Pentagon ? <p> Al Qaeda sees plainly that the United States is the financial supporter that keeps Israel strong . The United States gives Israel and Egypt each $4 billion a year in aid . On almost every major building in Israel , one can find plaques filled with names of contributors from the United States . Moreover , the United States is a symbol of much of what Muslim terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are against . A strike against the strongest military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and globalization was viewed as a fundamental goal . By attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , al Qaeda wanted to make Americans take notice of what the United States was doing wrong in the Middle East . <p> A strike on the United States had a practical side as well ; it was a good target . As an open system with the basic freedoms of a democratic society , many of the protective screens against terrorism were simply not in place . Air transportation policies were designed to help business travelers and tourists get to their destinations with a minimum of hassle . Those policies were not focused on the dangers posed by a purposeful , determined , ruthless , and well-trained group of terrorists . Technology and communications are well developed in the United States , which also made it easier for the terrorists to plan and execute their operations . The Economic Impact <p> The terrorists who planned the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , understood that New York City is the financial center of the United States , the home of the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations maintain their headquarters there , making the city the heart of the foreign exchange market and a vital link in international trade relations . <p> The shock of the September 11 attacks may well have done more damage than even al Qaeda had imagined possible . An economy that was already showing signs of weakness moved further into recession . The psychological effects of the attacks adversely affected consumer spending . Air travel dropped at the same time as oil prices increased . That double whammy produced great difficulties for the airline industries , which soon sought and received help from the federal government to remain in business . <p> Other industries were affected as well : <p> -- Insurance companies faced with large payouts raised worries about rate increases . <p> -- Manufacturers worried about disruptions of supplies began to rethink " just-in-time " inventories and other efficiencies that depended on quick and uninterrupted transportation . <p> -- Concerns increased about the stability of future energy supplies . <p> Because of concerns that the events of September 11 would further contribute to an emerging economic recession , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly approved , which included spending for homeland defense and rebuilding New York 's financial district . Subsequently , a $60- to $75-billion stimulus package was approved , which included a $15 billion relief package for airlines . A Teaching Suggestion <p> How might a high school economics teacher approach September 11 with his or her students ? We offer this suggestion . Pose the following mystery to the class : <p> A basic assumption of economics is that people act rationally , in their own self interest . On September 11 , members of al Qaeda led suicide attacks that killed more than two thousand people , including the terrorists themselves . How can terrorist acts , such as those of September 11 , be viewed as rational and self-interested ? Is n't terrorism the work of irrational zealots ? <p> Remind the students of some of the key points of the economic way of thinking , such as the following : <p> -- People choose . They try to select the best combination of benefits and costs . <p> -- People 's choices involve costs . <p> -- People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose the following true or false statements to the class , and allow the students to discuss their responses : <p> 1 . Terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are poorly organized groups of misfits . <p> False . Encourage several responses from the students , but point out that al Qaeda was , in fact , a well-organized network with a leadership structure and a decentralized approach . <p> 2 . Terrorist groups such as al Qaeda have only a vague sense of purpose . <p> False . Stress that al Qaeda had a set of goals , including removing all United States presence from Saudi Arabia and destroying Israel . <p> 3 . Terrorist groups , like criminals in the United States , respond to incentives in predictable ways . <p> True . After several student responses , stress the analysis of criminal behavior by Gary S. Becker , who claims that criminals and even terrorists respond to economic incentives . <p> Ask the students to solve the mystery . The economic way of thinking suggests that terrorist groups such as al Qaeda are acting in a rational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inspire them and many others . The failure of the United States and others to respond swiftly to earlier terrorist attacks or to address the concerns in the Middle East raised by the Arab community as a whole helped provide an incentive for further , more dramatic attacks . The failure to act eventually resulted in severe economic damage . It set the stage for retaliation against governments that support terrorist organizations , including Afghanistan and Iraq . Conclusions and Further Resources <p> Economics is usually associated with matters having to do with the operation of markets and behavior in the private sector . Pioneering economists over the past several years have expanded the scope of the economics approach to include such social behavior as crime , dating , fertility , voting , and so forth . This article , influenced by the work of economists such as Gary S. Becker , illustrates how an economics approach can be applied to terrorist acts and used in high school economics classes . <p> High school economics teachers who are interested in similar approaches should visit http : //www.ncee.net/ and examine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2003 ) . The curriculum has forty-five lessons for teaching high school economics and seven new economic mysteries that apply the economic way of thinking to such things as couch potatoes and voter turnout . <p> 
##4002469 Key words : content standards ; experiential education ; service-learning ; social studies ; science ; archaeology <p> Experiential education , developed more than a century ago , is a guide for instructors interested in helping students capture the meaning of their learning experiences . John Dewey ( 1963 ) in Experience and Education emphasized that events are present and operative but that what concerns us is their meaning . Dewey judged the quality of an educational experience by its intellectual and moral benefits to the student and the long-term benefits to the community . For example , students may learn about ethics , character , and citizenship through the planned study of archaeology , but it is the instructor who is responsible for creating the situation , conditions for further growth of curiosity , and desire and purpose ( Moe , Coleman , Fink , and Krejs 2002 ) . <p> Lewin ( 1952 ) proposed that personal development occurs through the successful realization of goals achieved by a process of trial and error or through experimentation . That approach is a contrast to the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve . Experiential education is different from the traditional education of the nineteenth century because of an added emphasis on subjective and objective knowledge in the process of creating knowledge through action and its emphasis on social rewards ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) . Experiential education includes different types of individualized and group learning experiences . A popular form of experiential education is service learning , which aims to enhance students ' understanding through active participation in community activities . According to Florida International University ( 2004 ) , the goals of service-learning projects for young adults include the following : <p> -- To enhance student learning by joining theory with experience and thought with action <p> -- To assist students to see the relevance of the academic subject to the real world <p> -- To develop an environment of collegial participation among students , faculty members , and the community <p> -- To increase the civic and citizenship skills of students <p> -- To develop a richer context for student learning <p> -- To give students greater responsibility for their learning <p> Today , service-learning requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The National Service-Learning Cooperative ( 2002 ) defines service learning as a method of teaching and learning method that connects meaningful community-service experience with academic learning , personal growth , and civic responsibility . <p> According to a National Household Education Survey , 80 percent of public high schools offered service-learning opportunities during that year ( Mintz and Liu 1994 ) . Two-thirds of American schools arranged service work for students in grades six through twelve , matching opportunities with volunteers . Twenty-one percent of schools required that students complete a specific number of service hours before graduation . More than one-half of secondary students participated in service learning in 1999 ( Kleiner and Chapman 1999 ) . <p> To assess the benefits of engaging students in service learning , Eyler and Giles ( 1999 ) surveyed more than 1,500 students selected from twenty institutions of higher education to determine cognitive outcomes of service-learning projects . Students reported enhanced understanding of course material , new awareness of complexity of personal and social issues , and practical ability to apply course content . Higher quality service-learning experiences fostered development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in volunteer archaeology field work enhances students ' understanding of the scientific method as applied to the study of human history . Ten important principles of good practice provided direction to program planners and educators ( Cooper 2003 ) . <p> Relationship of Service-Learning Experiences to Discipline-Specific Standards Service learning is compatible with general and discipline-specific educational standards ( Moe , Coleman , Fink , and Krejs 2002 ; Cooper 2003 ) . The National Education Goals for the year 2000 emphasized preparing students for responsible citizenship , including involving America 's students in community service activities ( Brown 1998 ; Kleiner and Chapman 1999 ) . Specific social studies and science standards are compatible with planned experiences for student service learning . The National Council for the Social Studies ( NCSS 2003 ) promotes a set of curriculum standards and performance expectations . Three of the ten thematic strands are particularly relevant to experiential education through archaeology projects : culture ; time , continuity , and change ; and people , places , and environments . The culture strand includes " experiences that provide for the study of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continuity and change includes " experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time . " Finally , the strand of people , places and environments includes " experiences that provide for the study of people , places , and environments . " States may elect to use those strands as a guide in the development of local curricula . Table 1 contains selected content standards for the disciplines of social studies and science that were approved by the Alabama State Board of Education to guide classroom and field instruction . By using a combination of instructional methods ( lecture , reading and writing assignments , laboratory and field experiences ) , teachers increase the likelihood of achieving those content standards . <p> Archaeology offers a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary learning ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ) . According to Cooper ( 2003 ) , " teaching archaeology enhances students ' proficiency in critical thinking and reveals to them the process of historical interpretation . " Archaeology service learning is distinctive from volunteer work because " it affords active learning through workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is certainly possible for groups of middle and high school students to learn about social studies and to participate in outdoor recreational activities . With planned classroom activities , teachers can introduce students to the scientific method and have them apply research skills during their study of the past inhabitants of a specific region . <p> Many states offer volunteer archaeology field experiences through universities , archaeological and anthropological societies , and museums . These are ideal opportunities for student field trips and parent-child excursions . Social studies teachers may help parents to understand the connections between field work and reaching standards for student achievement . For instance , the Alabama Museum of Natural History has formed partnerships with high school history teachers and guidance counselors to recruit and select student participants for its summer field school . <p> Archaeology projects vary according to the instructional goals of the social studies classroom teacher . Although not all teachers can supervise off-campus visits to observe archaeologists at excavations or conservation sites , they can develop a WebQuest student research project ( see online examples and template for teachers at http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WebQuest in 1997 ( DiscoverySchool.com 2003 ) . Her aims were to facilitate student group work to research the similarities between Roman civilization and our own and to explore how Roman civilization has influenced us . Medieval Japan Newspaper WebQuest ( Heath n.d. ) is another example of a social studies research project for teaching students about the culture of a past civilization . An Educator 's Experiences <p> During the summers of 2001-03 , my children and I participated in three different archaeology field expeditions held in three southeastern states . The first was a joint field school venture in the George Washington National Forest , conducted by the USDA Forest Service ( FS ) and the Archeological Society of Virginia . The second summer , we were at an FS laboratory school in the DeSoto National Forest in coastal Mississippi . The third was hosted by the University of Alabama Museum of Natural History at San Estevan in remote southwestern Alabama . That was the site of a former settlement established on the frontier of the Mississippi territory in the early nineteenth century . <p> Our family 's primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become self-sufficient when apart from modern conveniences and technology . We successfully combined family camping vacations with volunteer fieldwork -- learning while recreating . Our secondary goal was to satisfy university and high school community service-learning requirements . We accomplished all goals . <p> The natural scenery of each site was spectacular . Hidden Valley is nestled in a secluded area near the resort villages of Warm Springs and Hot Springs , Virginia . On our way to the field site , we visited Falling Springs Water Fall , described by Thomas Jefferson as one of the great natural wonders of Virginia . After days of fieldwork , tired muscles found relief in the Jefferson Baths , hot mineral springs used for healing for centuries . <p> In Mississippi , we cavorted in warm clear lake waters adjacent to our tent site at the conclusion of each day in the laboratory . The campsite was in Flint Creek Waterpark , part of the Pat Harrison Waterway District . The Tombigbee River flowed adjacent to the Alabama site . During our free time , we swam in a clean and refreshing lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Oligocene and Eocene eras . <p> While hiking along fields and rocky river beds in each state , we came upon diverse fauna : buck deer , does and fawns , rabbits , turkey , turtles , one splashy beaver , an elusive mountain cat , frogs and salamanders , and a myriad of insects . We gladly joined other archaeology volunteers to share fellowship , meals , stories , songs , and games . The Passport in Time Program <p> Passport in Time ( PIT ) is an exciting volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program of the Forest Service . Individuals and families learn through experiential field and laboratory work that can last several days or weeks . Throughout the year , PIT volunteers learn to survey and excavate archaeological sites , rehabilitate rock art and historic sites , gather oral histories and archival data , and write interpretive brochures for future visitors . PIT sites are numerous across the national forests , grasslands , and prairies managed by the USDA Forest Service . The print and online PIT newsletter features stories about past projects , future opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 ; USDA Forest Service , Southern Region 1998 ) . <p> Gordon Peters , the founder of PIT , taught field schools at FS sites in Minnesota . Naturalists from lakeside resorts brought guests to see archeologists at work , and that became a popular outing . In response to requests from the naturalists and FS interpretive specialists , Peters agreed to continue his fieldwork and invite volunteers to participate . " That was the beginning of something beautiful ! " Peters said ( Passport in Time 2001 ) . <p> In 1989-90 , the project expanded to FS sites in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , and Utah . In 1991 , archaeologist Mike Beckes convinced FS administrators to recognize PIT officially as a national program . Since its inception , PIT projects have been conducted in 117 national forests in thirty-six states . Many of those sites would not have been thoroughly investigated without the efforts of dedicated adult and youth volunteers . According to the program 's officials , " Volunteers have helped to stabilize ancient cliff dwellings in New Mexico , excavate a 10,000-year-old village site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clean vandalized rock art in Colorado , survey for sites in a rugged Montana wilderness , and excavate a nineteenth-century Chinese mining site in Hell 's Canyon in Idaho " ( Passport in Time 2001 ) . University of Alabama Field School <p> The University of Alabama Museum of Natural History sponsors a related archaeology field school . The museum 's origins date from 1831 with the establishment of its first natural history specimens . The museum collections were reestablished in 1872 after destruction by fire during the Civil War . Today , holdings include the only meteorite known to have struck a human ; fossils ; and rocks and minerals from the Coal , Dinosaur , and Ice Ages ; there are also changing exhibits . Moundville Archaeological Park , a 320-acre National Historic Landmark , was added to the museum in 1929 . Moundville contains more than twenty preserved fourteenth-century Indian mounds ( Hall 2003 ) . <p> For the past twenty-five years , high school and college students have worked under the close supervision of museum staff members , experienced student peer leaders , and contract archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first field school site was Moundville Archaeological Park . The University of Alabama Field School was established for two purposes : to increase high school students ' interest in sciences and to recruit bright and talented students to enroll at the university ( Hall 2003 ) . The mean age of student volunteers is fourteen years . Adult volunteers are welcome to work cooperatively with the target audience of high school students . Readers can learn more about past expeditions at http : **33;4372;TOOLONG . Participants <p> Volunteers for the three projects came from many states -- Alabama , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , Ohio , Texas , Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia . High school and college students worked in small field teams that varied in size from four to twelve members , depending on assigned tasks . All teams in Virginia , Mississippi , and Alabama included youths and adults working together . Each age group benefited from the perspectives of the other . <p> The adult volunteers were a diverse group of retired seniors , a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and college teachers enjoying a different type of vacation . The naturalist and historians were Alabama state employees who sought to develop more effective teaching strategies for history and science , engage youth in conservation projects , and encourage future college enrollment . Most team leaders were experienced college students . Team members shared equal responsibility to maintain safe , clean , and secure campsites and excavation areas . <p> American volunteers felt fortunate to share our natural wonders and culture with international graduate students who hailed from the United Kingdom , Northern Ireland , and New Zealand . Those students were participants in a cooperative residency program with USDA Forest Service . Principles of Good Practice <p> Program sponsors incorporated ten important principles of good practice into the archaeology service-learning projects : intention , planning , orientation , clarity , authenticity , monitoring , reflection , evaluation , recognition , and continuous improvement ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) . Social studies teachers and their students can apply these ten principles to judge the merits of similar projects that offer service learning or course credit outside planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators was to define specific learning and knowledge that they intended students to gain from service-learning projects in social studies . Two aims were to have students gain appreciation and interest in the sciences , natural history , and archaeology and to learn to apply the scientific method to planning and conducting excavations of prehistoric and historic sites . Service-learning projects may vary from single day visits to a historic site to extended fieldwork lasting several days . <p> The University of Alabama Museum of Natural History sponsors an archaeology field school . The museum dates from 1831 , and its holdings include the only meteorite known to have struck a human . <p> Sponsors began planning more than one year before the expeditions began , selecting and mapping sites , obtaining test auger samples , meeting local residents , and obtaining required federal and state permits . School site partners in each state ( teachers and administrators ) helped to determine which grades and classes would visit ongoing excavations . Although several schools wanted to bring entire grades to visit field sites , administrators limited the number of student observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts and possible injuries to students . <p> Six months before summer expeditions , sponsors were busy hiring and training team leaders , promoting program participation among schools , and soliciting volunteer applications from adults and students . Planning steps during the spring included obtaining medical and personal information from volunteers ; gathering release-from-liability forms ; mailing maps and driving directions ; assembling equipment , tools , and foodstuffs ; and securing approval for high school course credit . The month before their arrival at the expeditions , the student and adult volunteers received written and electronic material as an orientation to the history of the site . Teachers will find that books with a regional focus on archaeology are useful to orient students ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ; Samford and Ribblett 1995 ; Zschomler and Brown 1996 ) . <p> On the way to the Alabama site , we joined the members of the Alabama Archaeological Society in Montgomery , the capital . The curator of the Native American and antebellum collections led the group in a private tour of the extensive collections of the state archives , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the area of excavation . That was a rare opportunity not usually offered to students or the general public . <p> Ongoing communication was essential to achieve clarity of purpose . Oral presentation and written materials presented volunteer expectations , responsibilities , project timelines , and projected outcomes of archaeology fieldwork . Working at the Site <p> When we arrived at field sites in Virginia , Mississippi , and Alabama , the project sponsors oriented the volunteers to the natural history of the field site and the lifestyles and descendants of early inhabitants . We learned the results of past work and viewed samples of artifacts that we were likely to discover . In Alabama , the students toured a local county museum with a collection of artifacts . <p> Sponsors and educators presented protocols and procedures to follow when excavating or identifying and preparing artifacts for laboratory study . Those included methods of dry and wet screening , reporting significant finds , preserving all artifacts , and protecting excavation sites ( Mamola and Bloodgood 2002 ; Hall 2003 ; Passport in Time and Archaeological Society of Virginia 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the scientific method to archaeology fieldwork . Experienced college students or adult volunteers supervised the work of the youngest students . Our tasks varied from careful excavation to identification and classification of human and natural artifacts . <p> Historic artifacts were identified , labeled , recorded , and separately bagged . All artifacts were separated as lithic ( stone or rock ) , ceramics , bone , and historic ( metal , wood , brick , glass ) . Lithics were separated , weighed , labeled , and bagged . Fine details of pottery fragments were examined , such as the grain size , type of temper , hardness , surface decoration , average thickness , surface and interior colors , and rim type . <p> The Tools We Used <p> Students and adults used simple tools and keen observation skills . Their equipment included shovels , trowels , five-gallon buckets , wheelbarrows , tarps , scale , wire mesh screen , saw horses , graph paper , rulers , plumb bobs , measuring tapes , stakes and string , camera , artifact sizing boxes , classification guides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because several tools required practice for accurate use , students worked beside project leaders to minimize errors of identification and curation . <p> Monitoring and Evaluation <p> All volunteers were monitored by project leaders , professional archaeologists , historians , and **26;4407;TOOLONG . Levels of monitoring included on-site review by team leaders and peers , individual reflection of tasks completed ( Cooper 2002 ) , comparison of results to field guides , and a daily presentation to share discoveries with project leaders and members of other teams . Project leaders ensured that volunteers were hydrated and protected from the elements , and outdoor work was halted in the event of lightning and thunderstorms . <p> Leaders repeated instructions as often as necessary , giving detailed explanations about the importance of protocol and ethical practices . Project leaders and professional archaeologists corrected our errors , a level of careful supervision rarely offered to volunteers in other settings . Team members cooperated , asked questions , and celebrated achievements . The student and adult volunteers became more confident with each day 's efforts and learned to help one another with difficult tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed simple evaluation forms on which they reflected on their experience and offered suggestions to the sponsors for improvement . Each volunteer wrote of expedition highlights , satisfaction with orientation and training , and changes he or she would make as project leader . <p> Outcomes <p> It was challenging to focus our attention on a single plot of earth , five feet wide by five feet long , or to work in a small station within a field laboratory . The hot southeastern summer days and a tropical storm during the Alabama expedition were distractions while in the field . Some of the younger volunteers were unused to long periods of outdoor labor and needed adult encouragement and rest breaks . <p> We uncovered evidence of habitation by early Native Americans at the Virginia and Mississippi sites and remnants of a frontier hotel at the Alabama site . We marveled at simple objects that were crafted six centuries ago -- stone handtools , biface points , and pottery indented with plant material and thumbnail imprints . Alabama team members excitedly shared artifacts of early nineteenth-century frontier life : teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cattle ; Spanish and early American coins ; an intricate compass ; hand-painted porcelain ware ; silverware ; carved and polished oyster shells ; clay marbles ; buttons of brass , bone , and clay ; pipe stems and bowls ; stoneware ink jars ; dark , thick glass bottles ; and wafer-thin window glass . <p> Student and adult volunteers relaxed as they worked , sharing jokes and anecdotes . There was friendly competition between teams trying to find the most surprising artifacts . We shared new discoveries and searched field guides for information about their production and use . Daily team meetings permitted us to share discoveries , ask questions of the experts , record our observations , and view natural history specimens . Conclusion <p> Project sponsors followed the ten principles of good practice for the experiential education archaeology projects ( National Society for Experiential Education 1997 ) , which social studies teachers can apply when selecting local projects for student participation . Participants received many rewards . Recognition by the Forest Service included awarding each participant a patch , button , and PIT Passport to document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the PIT moose logo . The University of Alabama 's recognition packet included a CD-ROM of digital images taken during the field camp , a personal note of thanks , and an invitation from the camp director to return next year . Some students earned high school and college credit through program participation in Alabama and Mississippi . For many , the intangible rewards were the more important ; they had acquired a new sense of kinship with prehistoric and historic residents of the southeast and a deeper understanding of human history . Recreation through active learning had afforded them exceptional opportunities for history to come to life . <p> Outdoor exploration was a healthy alternative to students ' sedentary pursuits on summer vacation . All arose at dawn and worked a full day . Teens and adults were considered equal members of field and laboratory teams , performing the same meaningful tasks . Teenage volunteers gathered and packed supplies . Project sponsors taught them to maintain neat and safe campsites . Each shared in meal preparation . Many seemed to thrive on the increased responsibility and the extra attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adult volunteers . We marveled at how hot summer days passed quickly when we were intensely engaged in the process of discovery . <p> Student and adult volunteers learned to appreciate the tedious and dedicated work of professional archaeologists while honing skills of classification , measurement , and recording artifacts . Several students remarked that experiential education encouraged them to consider archaeology , paleontology , or another field science as potential career choices , which was one of the project 's aims . <p> Friendships were formed with the other volunteers and professional archaeologists as we shared lunch in the field and dinner at the campsite , swapped stories and discoveries , and studied the scientific method and natural history . Volunteers at each site posed for group photos and enjoyed evening games , stories , skits and songs . We found it difficult to leave at the end of each project , and we definitely plan to participate in other field schools . TABLE 1 . Selected State Content Standards by Discipline Compatible with Experiential Learning in Archaeology PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> 
##4002470 Key words : poetry and social justice ; poetry and the social studies ; poetry and cultural diversity <p> As a teacher educator committed to raising issues of racial , economic , and gender equality and those related to an appreciation for diversity , I find poetry to be a powerful resource in social studies methods classes . When preparing preservice teachers for elementary and middle school levels , I find that poetry can often capture their attention and address controversial issues in a meaningful , less-threatening manner . Poets frequently share their personal experiences with cultural diversity , racism , sexism , or classism in short , potent phrases . Poems often affirm women and cultural groups that are less valued in our society , praise individuals who resisted oppression , or portray the harm resulting from prejudicial comments or discriminatory actions . For example , in my social studies methods class , when we read " Harriet Tubman " by Eloise Greenfield ( Hudson 1993 ) , we discuss Tubman 's spirit and courage to resist slavery through her leadership in the Underground Railroad . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma Flor Ada ( Ada 1997 ) , we consider the importance of farm workers who , for little pay and at great personal risk , provide many of our foods . After a decade of using poetry appropriate for children and youth as a social studies resource , I continue to be impressed with how much teacher-education students are moved by poetry when they seem untouched by more objective resources . I hope , of course , that those students will consider the power of poetry when they address multicultural social studies themes in their own classrooms . Achieving the Goals of the Social Studies Methods Course through Poetry <p> As a methods teacher , I emphasize Sleeter and Grant 's ( 1999 ) conception of a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach to social studies . That orientation affirms cultural diversity , fosters equal opportunities , and challenges social stratification . The poems " I , Too , Sing America " and " Merry-Go-Round , " by Langston Hughes , document and challenge racial segregation and inequality during the first half of the twentieth century ( Clinton 1998 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Look Like a Girl ( 1999 ) , by Sheila Hamanaka , affirm children 's cultural diversity and girls ' strength . With a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach in the methods class , I also address such social issues as racism , sexism , and classism ; integrate the experiences and perspectives of women and men from different cultural groups ; include students ' life experiences , especially those that revolve around issues of oppression ; and encourage students to think critically and analyze different perspectives . The poetry in Janet Wong 's Good Luck Gold and Other Poems ( 1994 ) and Jane Medina 's My Name is Jorge : On Both Sides of the River ( 1999 ) provide personal perspectives of racial prejudices , discrimination , and blatant racism . Readers of those poems consider the racism inherent in teasing , stereotyping , and labeling . <p> Another important goal of the course is to encourage preservice teachers to read critically and develop critical literacy . As the teacher , I recognize that my students ' individual experiences , as well as their gender , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other reading and their participation in discussions ( Edelsky 1999 ) . I encourage critical literacy by asking preservice students to consider the social issues in their readings , even if they prefer to ignore them . Although I avoid imposing my own critique ( Edelsky 1999 ) , I select readings , including poetry , that specifically raise those issues and affirm cultural diversity . Poems from Wachale ! Poetry and Prose about Growing Up Latino in America ( Stavans 2001 ) , I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry ( Clinton 1998 ) , Pass It On : African American Poetry for Children ( Hudson 1993 ) , and Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) are excellent catalysts for class discussion of such topics . Why Read Poetry in Elementary Social Studies ? <p> For elementary teachers who must meet the national social studies standards ( National Council for the Social Studies 1994 ) , emphasize literacy within the curriculum , and face limited time for teaching social studies , I recommend poetry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of the ten thematic strands of social studies ( see Vardell 2003 for suggested poems for each thematic strand ) . Teachers committed to a multicultural , social reconstructionist approach may select poems that are not only congruent with this orientation but also address the thematic strands of culture ; time , continuity , and change ; individual development and identity ; individuals , groups , and institutions ; power , authority and governance ; and civic ideals and practices . Teach the Social Studies Standards <p> The poems in Thirteen Moons on Turtle 's Back : A Native American Year of Moons ( 1992 ) , by Joseph Bruchac and Jonathan London , and The Earth Under Sky Bear 's Feet : Native American Poems of the Land ( 1995 ) , by Joseph Bruchac and Thomas Locker , reveal the important similarities and the diversity among Native American cultures . They address the thematic strand of culture by expressing various Native American nations ' beliefs about the natural world . <p> The theme of time , continuity , and change is illustrated in the collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Difference , by Ann Whitford Paul ( 1999 ) . The poems commemorate brave actions taken by fourteen famous and ordinary young women who lived during various eras from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries in the United States . The poems compiled by Lillian Morrison in More Spice Than Sugar : Poems about Feisty Females ( 2001 ) also honor the accomplishments of women in U.S. history , such as Amelia Earhart , Rosa Parks , Sojourner Truth , and Molly Pitcher . <p> The theme of individual development and identity is explored in Francisco X. Alarcn 's bilingual English and Spanish poems in Laughing Tomatoes and Other Spring Poems ( 1997 ) , From the Bellybutton of the Moon and Other Summer Poems ( 1998 ) , and Angels Ride Bikes and Other Fall Poems ( 1999 ) . Alarcn 's poems describe his childhood memories of his family , family activities , their visit to Mexico , and their daily life in Los Angeles as Mexican Americans . The poems in Meet Danitra Brown , by Nikki Grimes ( 1994 ) also address individual development and identity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another when others disparage their skin color , body shape , and eye glasses . <p> The thematic strand of individuals , groups , and institutions is incorporated in the bilingual English and Spanish poems from My Name Is Jorge ( Medina 1999 ) , which describe a Mexican American boy 's struggles in school in the United States . The poems raise awareness of the harmful effects of school on English language learners when teachers mispronounce their names , other students make prejudicial comments about ESL class , and others disparage the students ' first language . <p> With power and authority , poems from Under the Quilt of Night ( Hopkinson 2001 ) illustrate escaping from slavery on the Underground Railroad , the legalized racism inherent in slavery , and the conflicts between slave owners and slaves and the abolitionists who broke the law by helping slaves escape . The poem " Midway , " by Naomi Long Madgett ( Hudson 1993 ) , also depicts a slave 's determination to escape from legalized slavery , and the poem " Harriet Tubman , " by Eloise Greenfield ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commitment to disobey the law and risk her own safety to escape from bondage and lead others to freedom . <p> Poems that illustrate civic ideals and practices include Elegy on the Death of Csar Chvez ( Anaya 2000 ) and I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry ( Clinton 1998 ) . The book-length poem about Csar Chvez treats Chvez 's resistance to injustices endured by farm workers and his efforts to organize migrant farm workers to fight for better conditions . A number of poems from I , Too , Sing America : Three Centuries of African American Poetry explore the injustice of slavery , legal racial segregation , and racial inequalities in the United States . Langston Hughes 's title poem , " I , Too , Sing America , " and " Merry-Go-Round " are especially powerful in their protest of racial segregation . Use Social Studies Instructional Time Wisely <p> The 2002 No Child Left Behind Act has a negative influence on social studies instruction . As elementary teachers teach the tested subjects of reading and mathematics , attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some elementary and middle school teachers report shortening social studies lessons or integrating reading and writing with social studies ( Editors 2003 ) . Elementary teachers with whom I have contact regularly complain about the lack of time to teach all of the requirements . Poetry can be a valuable teaching tool for helping them solve that problem . Fortunately , reading poetry consumes less time than reading trade books and frequently is more engaging and offers more insight than reading a textbook . Although poetry should remain a supplemental rather than a primary resource for social studies , poetry 's strength lies in its brevity , focus , rich vocabulary , emotion , imagination , and various perspectives ( Vardell 2003 ) . Poetry may show human reactions to historical or current events , historical complexities , and the shared consciousness of an era ( Meadows 1999 ) . Poetry can provide unique insights and descriptions of the world around us , increasing our understanding and awareness of our world ( Donaldson 2001 ) . Carefully selected poems can be read , reread , and discussed during brief instructional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant multicultural , social reconstructionist social studies concepts . Develop Literacy during Social Studies <p> Reading poetry is also appealing to elementary social studies teachers because it promotes literacy , an important life skill for students and one of the tested subjects mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act . Reading poetry aloud provides opportunities for elementary students to read for meaning , discovery , and enjoyment ; develop fluency and expression ; and acquire an appreciation for poetry as they learn about important social studies content . During group discussions about poetry , children practice summarizing important ideas and explaining their interpretation of the poems in light of their own experiences and prior knowledge . Rather than ask students for a " correct " interpretation , the teacher can help students build plausible , personal interpretations of poems related to the social studies topic under study . <p> Elementary teachers may also promote critical literacy by introducing poetry that provides diverse perspectives on social studies topics and raises social issues . They can encourage students to examine poems for their point of view , biases , and issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own interpretations of the poems ' meanings , justify those interpretations , and make connections between the poems and their own lives ( Creighton 1997 ; Edelsky 1999 ) . Teachers may also raise ideas and issues that the students overlook during the group discussion , always allowing for diverse responses to those ideas and issues ( Edelsky 1999 ) . Suggestions for Using Poetry in Social Studies <p> Select Poems Deliberately <p> When selecting poems , I recommend that teachers are careful to meet multicultural and social reconstructionist social studies goals , promote reading skills and critical literacy , and make wise use of instructional time . The most appropriate poems contain accurate historical facts and perspectives , provide authentic voices , are developmentally appropriate for students , and fit classroom time constraints ( Danks 1995 ) . Elementary teachers focusing on diversity among families as a social studies topic may choose " When Annie Was Adopted , " " Half-Whole-Step , " and " My Father " from Fathers , Mothers , Sisters , Brothers : A Collection of Family Poems ( Hoberman 1991 ) and " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) . Those poems illustrate different family structures , including single-parent , adoptive , and blended families . In the bilingual English and Spanish poem " Mi Abuela , " Christina Muniz Mutchler explores traditional and nontraditional roles of mothers and grandmothers . Carmen D. Lucca addresses family structure in " I Helped My Mom Not to Be Late for Work , " part of the collection called Love to Mam : A Tribute to Mothers ( Mora 2001 ) . In Daddy 's Arms I Am Tall : African Americans Celebrating Fathers ( 1997 ) contains poems that portray the various roles and qualities of African American fathers . Delia Spotted Bear , a teenage member of the Crow Nation , illustrates family closeness in her poem " My Family " in Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) . The Way a Door Closes ( Smith 2003 ) contains several poems from the perspective of an older son , addressing the challenges that families face when a parent loses a job . The family portrayed in the poems is a multigenerational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for any family . The poems are brief and portray various perspectives . ( For an annotated bibliography of poetry resources appropriate for teaching about diverse families from different cultures to elementary and middle school social studies students , see my Web site , http : **34;4435;TOOLONG . ) <p> Strategies for Reading Poetry <p> Before reading a poem aloud , the teacher needs to provide students with background information on the poet and the period when the poem was written . Books of poetry often contain brief biographies of the authors , or the book 's publisher may have additional information about the author on its Web site . For more extensive author information , teachers can consult the Academy of American Poets Web site at poets.org or complete an Internet search . When introducing the time period in which the poem was written , I suggest that teachers encourage children to relate the year to themselves and their families and that teachers ask questions such as " How old were you when this poem was written and originally published ? How old were your closest family members ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poem was written ? " With older elementary students , teachers can draw out their background knowledge of the important national , state , and community events of that time period and offer additional information on the historical and social context of the poem . <p> To ensure that all students engage in the poetry exercise , the teacher needs to vary the format for reading aloud ( see Vardell 2003 for descriptions of different methods ) . In my social studies methods class , I read poems aloud to preservice teachers at different times during the semester as a means to introduce or reinforce a topic . We also read poems together , choral fashion , or I divide the class into two large groups , with each group reading alternating stanzas . For large group readings , I usually display the poems through a computerized presentation program . The use of different colors for alternating stanzas helps the groups identify which stanzas to read . The students also read poems with a partner or read individually from a book of poetry . If they read with a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem to the rest of the class . When I ask preservice teachers to read poetry aloud , I allow them to prepare for the reading so that they are comfortable with word pronunciation or the meaning of a word or phrase . <p> Strategies for Discussing Poems <p> After we read a poem aloud , students try to explain the meaning of the poem 's important vocabulary and significant ideas . Because so many preservice teachers have had experiences with giving only the " correct interpretation " of poems and their symbolism , I stress that they are free to offer their own interpretation . To encourage greater participation , I ask them to share their ideas with a partner before offering them to the class . When addressing the issue of inequality and struggles for equality in social studies , I have the students read " I , Too , Sing America " and " Merry-Go-Round , " by Langston Hughes ( Clinton 1998 ) , both of which illustrate racism and racial segregation during the first half of the twentieth century . I encourage students to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sit at the table " in " I , Too , Sing America . " I have them describe the location of the " Jim Crow section " on a merry-go-round , bus , and train in " Merry-Go-Round . " I advise the preservice teachers that they should build on the ideas that the children offer and should add a brief explanation of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation before the 1960s civil rights movement . <p> One can find racial inequality for Native American people portrayed in the poem " Indians , " by Ophelia Rivas , a Tohono O'odham teen , in Rising Voices : Writings of Young Native Americans ( Hirschfelder and Singer 1992 ) . After reading the poem aloud , young students need to review their knowledge of Columbus , the Pilgrims , and Vikings and their roles in U.S. history . They also need to explain the meaning of the phrases " we are treated as though we do n't belong here " and " we are treated as though we just got here . " <p> To promote critical literacy and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher can have students offer their interpretations of the poems , the issues or themes raised in them , poetry 's contributions to understanding social studies content , and the connections between the issues in the poems and in the students ' own lives ( Creighton 1997 ; Edelsky 1999 ) . For example , the teacher may select poems that portray women 's challenges to racial and gender inequality -- " Ai n't I a Woman , " by Sojourner Truth , " Harriet Tubman , " by Eloise Greenfield , and " From Elizabeth Blackwell , " by Eve Merriam , which are in More Spice Than Sugar : Poems about Feisty Females ( Morrison 2001 ) . After reading the poems aloud , the children can explain what they learned from the poems and what led to their interpretations . The teacher needs to encourage different explanations and reasoning from the students . Once students express their initial responses to the poems , the teacher can have them focus on the issues raised in the poems and their relevance to social studies and students ' lives . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following questions : <p> What rights were the three women fighting for , and what is their importance ? <p> What did you learn about the issue of equality in the United States ? <p> How do these issues affect your own life ? <p> During the discussion , the teacher may add his or her own ideas , guarding against those ideas receiving more attention than the students ' views . <p> Another aspect of critical literacy is a careful analysis of the poets , including their backgrounds , for writing realistic poetry about the poem 's theme or social issue , the author 's purpose for writing the poetry , and the point of view and biases portrayed in the poem ( Creighton 1997 ) . When we read poems portraying racial stereotypes and discrimination , such as " Waiting at the Railroad Caf , " " Math , " and " Noise " from Good Luck Gold and Other Poems ( Wong 1994 ) , I explain to the preservice students that the author is Janet Wong , whose father immigrated from China and whose mother immigrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Los Angeles . Given that background , I encourage students to question if we can believe that the author is describing real experiences and can explain why Wong might have written about them . We discuss problems of a teacher 's stereotyping students on the basis of race , gender , or family background ; the harm resulting from racial discrimination through teasing ; and strategies for coping with racial discrimination . Finally , I ask the preservice students to identify the author 's perspective and any biases they notice in the poems . Sometimes we address the possible bias against European Americans and the advancement of the status of Chinese-Korean-Americans in some of Wong 's poetry . Conclusion <p> For elementary teachers who have limited time for social studies but must address the national social studies standards and promote their students ' literacy development simultaneously , poetry is a valuable resource . Teachers can read and discuss poems during brief instructional periods , while still engaging children and helping them learn significant social studies content . From my decade of experience reading poetry aloud in my social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preservice teachers and motivates them to think about multicultural , social reconstructionist ideas . They are often surprised that poetry is a credible supplementary social studies resource . Most preservice students appreciate the engaging language , personal tone , and deep emotions found in poetry that are missing from social studies textbooks . Poems make abstract issues of cultural diversity and racial , economic , and gender injustices real . Poetry definitely offers rich learning opportunities . I hope that the poetry read in my methods class will inspire the preservice teachers to address those issues later in their own classrooms and challenge injustices in their daily lives . <p> 
##4002471 Section : CLASSROOM Success Stories <p> Key words : trade books and teaching ; using a trade book to teach geography ; geography for fourth graders <p> Teachers are notorious for purchasing children 's literature . They seek books that entice students into the act of reading , support curricular objectives , and teach civic and moral lessons . Depending how it is used in a particular unit , quality literature can often bring subject areas to life for teachers and students . A book can be a powerful tool that supports learning in many ways . <p> For quite a few years , I conducted an interdisciplinary project called Travelmates with my fourth graders ( McCarty 1993 ) . The Travelmate unit was a way for fourth graders to " see the world " and yet never leave their classroom . Students sent out stuffed animals armed with a classroom pictorial dogtag , a letter of introduction , and a journal to record their traveling adventures . Once the travelmates were out the door , traveling with family members or friends , the fun began for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aruba , Belize , or San Francisco became common activities after mail delivery . Connecting Curriculum through Literature <p> A storybook that I felt would support this project as the Travelmates were touring the world was Anita Lobel 's book called Away from Home ( Lobel 1994 ) . The book has minimal text but is extremely rich with beautiful illustrations and wonderful use of alliteration . Lobel 's alphabet book sat on my shelf for over a year until I was asked to teach a demonstration lesson in social studies with my fourth grade students for a dozen teachers from Poland who were visiting the local university . I thought Ms. Lobel 's book would be perfect because the limited text would make the interpreter 's job less difficult . A description of the book printed in Instructor began as follows : <p> The curtain rises on an international cast of 26 boys , each of whom acts out a city scene against a backdrop depicting a famous sight : David dances in Detroit , Upton unpacks in Uxmal , and Xavier xylophones in Xian . ( Freeman 1993 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the lesson by reading the book . My elementary students and Polish teachers alike laughed at some of the scenes . Our guest teachers even started chattering when they heard " Keith kicks in Krakow " as we progressed through this alliterative-designed alphabet book . The interpreter explained later to the class that the city of Krakow was in Poland and that the scenery depicted on the page of the book was the very beloved centerpiece of the city . All of the teachers from Poland had visited that place at one time in their lives . <p> The lesson proceeded with teams of students and Polish teachers working together , using atlases to locate four or five of the twenty-six cities mentioned . One member of each team came forward to record the location ( state or country ) of the city on a previously prepared transparency with a vertical listing of the alphabet followed by a corresponding city and a blank space on which to write the city 's location . Then another team member located the city on a large world map while the others located the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team was as successful as the student teams in sharing that information orally . Extending Students ' Learning <p> I was pleased with the results of the lesson and congratulated the students for their efforts after the teachers left . I was stunned , however , by what my students said next : " Mrs. McCarty , we have to do more with this book . " <p> I replied in a laughing tone , " Like what ? " I thought the students were going to give me some flippant response that we all might enjoy . <p> " We have to create our own book , just like this author did , " Chris said in a very serious tone . <p> I paused for a moment . I really liked it when my students arrived at the conclusion that they needed to extend their learning . I had often encouraged such student thinking , but I started to ponder the following points : We only have three weeks of school left , and we have many curriculum objectives to complete . Can I really add one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen sometimes with my heart and not my head to students ' requests . I responded after that brief reverie , " What are you thinking ? " <p> The students started chattering away , brainstorming ideas , planning a design , being creative with their ideas . Then a hand shot up . " We ca n't create just one book . We have to make two ! " <p> " Why is that ? " I inquired . <p> " This book located cities around the world . Since we 're in fourth grade and have studied U.S. geography this year , we need to create a book that just features cities in the United States . We need to design this in addition to one that shows cities around the world , like Ms. Lobel 's book , " Domini promptly stated . <p> I had to agree with that thought . I considered how this could pull together some of the learning we had acquired this year . " How could we accomplish two books before school ends ? I do n't want to start this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a class , we decided that we would set aside our Writers ' Workshop stories , which each child was working on , and turn our efforts toward this class writing activity . We took a vote . The response was unanimous . Students knew that as they finished their work on the collective books , they would have time to go back to their other stories that were in various stages in the writing process or could continue to work on them on their own time . With a Plan of Action , Work Begins <p> We now knew the time frame that we had each day to work on the project . Next we needed to determine the design of the two books . After a brief class discussion , the group decided that we would follow the exact alliterative format that Lobel followed in her work . We talked about the meaning of that . Every sentence would need to be structured with a person 's first name , an action verb , and a prepositional phrase that ended with the name of a city that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first letter of the proper noun and verb . We practiced with a few names in the class : " Domini dived in Dallas " and " Lauren leaped in Little Rock . " The children were eager to use their own names in designing the book and wanted to write and illustrate the pages containing their names . That would work just fine . <p> Now we needed to determine where we could find assistance to begin the process . We had had some previous practice on word usage , so one of the students said that we would need a thesaurus . Another stated we would need a dictionary . Lauren wanted to know , " How are we going to find these places around the world ? " Then one student reminded everyone , " Remember the atlases we 've been using for Travelmate postcards when they return ? That 's what we can use . " The students thought that was a good idea . <p> From the back of the classroom , Andrew said , " We 're going to need to know something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , so Andrew and a couple friends marched off to the library to ask the librarian to help them find some books on the clothing or architectural designs found in different places around the world . That idea led the class to a discussion about " culture " and how we could represent culture appropriately through our illustrations . <p> We were ready to assign letters of the alphabet to different students so we could begin the production process . We divided the number of pages needed for two books by the number of students and assigned the appropriate number of pages to each person , making sure each had the letter of either his or her first or last name . Among the resources we used to discover more about people , places , and action verbs were books with babies ' names that some children brought to class . From those books , the children found such names as Xerxes , Ursula , Odel , or Zeeman . <p> My job as the facilitator was to design a template for the stage backdrop that would be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We designed it similar to Ms. Lobel 's book , just in a smaller version . We made a dummy copy so that the children could visualize how the final book would appear . Progressing toward Publication <p> In less than two weeks , the class had created exciting sentences by using thesauruses , dictionaries , and atlases . They illustrated and colored their artwork , trying to pay close attention to cultural details in the clothing or architectural designs that were unique to a particular country . We placed the artwork on template sheets designed to create two books . <p> The children worked collaboratively . Some had had more experiences that could help the others make better decisions in their artwork or word choice . The discoveries made during this process were incredible . For example , when Nick was designing the M and N pages in the international book , a classmate whose family had hosted a foreign exchange student from Japan the year before suggested that Nick use the Japanese name " Miura . " Nick liked the name and chose the action verb " married " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft design , he showed Miura in a white wedding gown . A student commented that that was not the outfit that Japanese women wore when they got married . Nick went back to the drawing board and found a book about the Japanese culture that showed a bride in a fancy kimono . His illustrated page had a background map of Japan with a Japanese woman wearing a fancy kimono . His sentence was : " Miura married in Maebashi . " That location is a city in Japan , near Tokyo . <p> The children were creative with their ideas . Brittanie wrote , " Brittanie boxed in Broken Hill . " Because Broken Hill is located in Australia , she drew a picture of herself and a kangaroo with boxing gloves located in a boxing ring ( fig. 1 ) . Another child wrote , " Yolanda yelled in Yorkton . " Because Yorkton is located in Canada , and the students knew that a popular sport in Canada is hockey , the child drew a person dressed in a hockey jersey with skates , hockey stick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler . Stephanie drew a young boy dreaming with a bubble that said , " I wonder ... " and wrote , " Isaac imagined in Iglesias " ( Italy ) . With each of their sentences and illustrations , the children conveyed a unique story . Finishing Details <p> As a group , we decided to make our book as real as possible . We designed a cover page , a copyright page , and a dedication page . We had different committees working separately on each book . Although one book focused on the world and the other on the United States , both committees decided that the title and author credits had to include Ms. Lobel 's name . Each book was called Away from Home II , with author credits given to " Anita Lobel &; the Fourth Grade . " <p> The children liked the information contained on the original copyright page about the watercolor and gouache paints and the Leawood text type . They decided to imitate that format and use the following information on their copyright page : " Colors and markers were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . " They dedicated both books to Anita Lobel and her work on the original book Away from Home and to all the children around the world working toward peace . I thought that was a fitting way for the children to pay tribute to the author 's work . One group also placed their school pictures on the copyright page so that anyone reading the book would know the children who wrote the book . <p> The children needed to add one more page to the books . Ms. Lobel ended her book with an index page that was a quick resource for children trying to locate the cities used in the text . We had compiled similar information for our books as we wrote the text by having each child responsible for his or her respective place . Examples from the index page in the international book include the following information : <p> Asuncion is the capital of Paraguay , a country in South America . <p> Broken Hill is in the country of New South Wales in Australia . <p> Jakarta is a city in Indonesia on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greece on the European continent . <p> The U.S. book index seems less exotic , with its more familiar examples such as the following : <p> Iowa City is the old capital of Iowa . <p> Orlando is a city that is growing rapidly and is a popular winter resort in Florida . <p> Portland is located on the northern border of Oregon . ( If you found the Portland in Maine , that 's cool too . ) <p> Quincy is located in Massachusetts near Boston . Conclusion <p> We laminated the pages of both books so that the work could be better preserved . The students were extremely proud of themselves and felt as if they were real authors . Some children asked for a copy of the book that they helped create . I supplied them with black and white copies . Others wanted copies of the dummy draft with text so they could draw their own illustrations over the summer vacation . Because of all their work , I decided that the children deserved a copy of the masterpiece in any form they desired . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children and me . We had become explorers , researchers , adventurers , tourists , and word sleuths . We also became more culturally literate and more aware geographically of what an exciting place the world can be . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 1 .

##4000950 FIRST OF A SERIES The Stain of War on Culture <p> " MA SA LAA CH'OOL ? " ARE YOU HAPPY IN YOUR HEART ? " SA LIN CH'OOL . " YES , I AM HAPPY IN MY HEART . <p> War does n't just disappear with the signing of a peace treaty and the onslaught of reconstruction efforts . 0To understand the true cost of any armed conflict , we must first consider the lingering effects of war one , five , ten , or twenty years from its official end . <p> THE MULTICOLORED VILLAGES of Chicaja and Maribach adorn the verdant Guatemalan hillsides that overlook the merging of the Chicaja and Cahabon rivers . Even before I arrived and met the thirty families that lived there , the exquisite greeting used by the Q'eqchi ' people captivated me . Language is like a mirror : a reflection of culture and lifestyle formed by the nuances of syntax and semantics . " Words only cover the experience of living , " author Barbara Kingsolver wrote , and the pure poetry of the few Q'eqchi ' phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people I would soon meet . <p> As the bustling cobblestone streets of Cahabon faded into the distance , we were moved to silence as we walked . Lush jungle trees formed a thick canopy above the footpath that was woven even tighter by the proliferation of tropical foliage and airplants growing in every imaginable crevice . Being familiar with the edible and medicinal qualities of plants native to my northern latitude , I was struck with the wealth of invaluable resources this diverse rainforest could surely provide its residents . We wound deeper into the low mountains , crossing the streams and rivers that divided the landscape until we came to the modest thatched roof hut of our hosts , twenty-four-year-old Candelaria , her husband Ramon , and their four young children . <p> My husband and I traveled to Chicaja and Maribach in 2001 to meet with Julia Weidmann , an international human rights witness with the Guatemalan Accompaniment Project . Guatemala 's civil war was perhaps the longest and most unspeakable war of modern times . Many events contributed to the start of the war , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sold out from under them to insatiable multinational companies . For thirty-seven long years villages were pitted against each other -- the indigenous people were terrorized by their neighbors who themselves were threatened into participating in a conflict that , in many ways , had little relevance to the sustenance of their way of life . The war 's impact became increasingly personal for the villagers : shattering families , forcing children into early adulthood , and sending unknown numbers of refugees away from their lands forever . The war officially ended in 1996 but the wounds of a decades-long war do n't heal with the mere signing of a paper . Atrocities continue even today , hence the need for international witnesses . <p> Early in our visit we noticed that the population of the twin villages was significantly skewed towards the younger ages -- there were very few elders . Candelaria described how she had become a chaq'na , or little mother , at age seven when her parents were massacred in the war , leaving her as the primary caregiver for her young siblings . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families north into Mexico and the United States . For many surviving older adults the spilling of so much innocent blood on their native lands had forever altered them . When the war finally ended they did n't return to that haunted place as those who had been younger during the most intense fighting did . <p> We quickly learned that the steamy jungle mid afternoons were fit for little more than seeking shelter inside the hut and performing low-energy chores such as shucking corn and playing with the babies . We practiced our Q'eqchi ' with Candelaria , and she asked us to teach her some Spanish words and phrases . We laughed together as we tried to make our tongues produce the foreign cadence of unfamiliar languages . Candelaria 's youngest child Aura toddled around the inside of our circle and cooed at our efforts . <p> " You like my baby ? " Candelaria asked Weidmann . <p> " Yes , how could I not like her ? " Weidman 's response was genuine . <p> " You can take her home with you . " Candelaria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure she had understood the message . She leaned forward to clarify . <p> " Home to America . " <p> An expression of surprise rushed across Weidmann 's face . " I could n't raise her . I ca n't speak Q'eqchi ' well enough to teach her her own language . " <p> " I do n't want her to learn Q'eqchi ' . I want her to speak Spanish . " <p> Our hearts were heavy as the aim of her request became clear to us . Candelaria wanted a better life for her child , not the difficult life the village entailed . And speaking Spanish was a key that opened up many opportunities in the mountain towns and allowed individuals to stand up for their rights . <p> The Q'eqchi ' communities were quickly eroding and becoming more isolated with each passing year . And each year it became more essential for the indigenous population to learn Spanish . Yet with the death of any language also comes the passing of a culture . And the thought of removing this beautiful way of life from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our days in Chicaja and Maribach were shaped by the vibrant colors of the Mayan culture . The women wore traditional woven skirts with patterns depicting the life-sustaining corn plant and Mayan gods . Women and men alike used a narrow sling of fabric over their heads to transport everything from ebony-haired babies to canvas bags full of black beans . A few women still wove colorful strips of fabric using traditional backstrap looms . Spicy red chilies were spread across sheets of corrugated metal to wrinkle in the sun until they were dry enough to store . <p> These tidbits whetted our appetites for deeper cultural teachings from our hosts . We asked the men , " What plants in the forest can the people harvest for food and medicine ? " They shook their heads in response . " What plants should be avoided ? " Again they indicated that they did n't know which plants . Weidmann , who had been living as a member of the village for nine months at that time , asked for permission to interview community members . When several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the lullabies that you sing to your babies ? " They looked at one another with uncertain glances . " Do you tell your children the nursery rhymes and tales that your families passed down to you ? " They could n't name any . The Guatemalan civil war had not only decimated the few generations that had endured it but it had irreversibly interrupted the entire history of a culture and a way of life . It would take more than a peace agreement to stop the events that had already been set in motion . <p> Our interview with the village women continued . Weidmann gently asked what the reasons were for fighting the war . The war clearly had a greater impact on this community than any other single factor . The women turned towards each other and talked together in mumbled phrases and blank looks . They adjusted the babies at their breasts and seemed to wait for someone other than themselves to give an answer . Finally one spoke up and said , " We do n't know . " In that moment I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , my heart was filled with respect for these strong Mayan people holding fast and beginning anew despite an outside world that seems resolved to tear them apart . Certainly much of their history as a people had been taken from them but the ancestral strength and determination that runs through their veins can never be destroyed . Like the great Mayan temples of Tikal that still tower above the jungle in the north , the modern-day Mayan people will likewise endure . <p> Two years later I met with Weidmann again near her San Francisco home to reflect on our experiences in Maribach and Chicaja . Why does war most heavily affect the poor ? Is it possible to separate language from culture ? Can a culture once lost be restored ? How does life persist in spite of intense suffering ? <p> Surrounded by the lush gardens in Golden Gate Park we read to one another from Michael J. Caduto 's book , Earth Tales from Around the World . In the introduction Caduto wrote , " stories are the heart and soul of many cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in " As we read to one another from the book of ancient tales we came to understand that stories also serve as a means to help us make sense of life 's senseless situations . The following story , " The First Bats , " as retold by Caduto , is from the Jakaltec-Maya ( Guatemala and Mexico ) . It 's a tale of the first mice , their discontent with a terrestrial existence , and how , as individuals , they either maintained their status or evolved and changed . <p> " It is time , " said the Creator . The mice began to chatter . <p> " Anyone who can jump across this ravine and land safely on the other side will be given wings and the power of flight . " <p> One at a time , the mice ran to the edge of the chasm and leaped into the air . Many fell short and remained mice thereafter . Those who reached the other side grew thin wings of skin . Their tails fell off and the tiny claws grew long and curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark caves in the mountains . <p> When all of the mice had jumped , the Creator spoke to them one last time . " Now it is done . Those of you who are still mice will eat seeds and nuts . You can make warm nests and finish them with a soft lining . You can nest in the trees or wherever you find a good space for a home . From this day forth , the rest of you will now be known as Sotz ' , the bats . The mouse 's night will be your day . Some of you will eat mosquitoes , others will eat fruit and still others will drink blood . No longer will you live in cozy nests . By your sharp claws you will cling upside down from the roofs of the caverns , nchach'en . " <p> The mouse , Tx'ow , saw that Sotz ' , the bats , too , were not entirely pleased with their lives . That is how mice came to be content with the gifts they received when first created . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far from over . Each community member will make a myriad of individual decisions that will ultimately affect the whole : they will determine which language or languages to learn and speak , they will embrace or separate from the dominant Latin culture , and they will arrive at the best land management decisions to protect their farmlands . These decisions belong to individuals but they will meld together to create a distinct flavor and form the backbone of the modern-day Mayan community . As we discovered in " The First Bats , " regardless of a community 's gifts there will also be feelings of discontent . But in spite of the choices that are made and the obstacles that present themselves , the extraordinary people of Maribach and Chicaja model a spirit of indescribable hope and determination -- qualities that the rest of the world can only aspire to possess . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Michelle Bargo <p> <p> When not living abroad , Michelle Bargo resides in Cincinnati , Ohio .

##4002772 Section : Comments Today 's Insurgents in Iraq Are Tomorrow 's Terrorists <p> When the United States started sending guns and money to the Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s , it had a clearly defined Cold War purpose : helping expel the Soviet army , which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979 . And so it made sense that once the Afghan jihad forced a Soviet withdrawal a decade later , Washington would lose interest in the rebels . For the international mujahideen drawn to the Afghan conflict , however , the fight was just beginning . They opened new fronts in the name of global jihad and became the spearhead of Islamist terrorism . The seriousness of the blowback became clear to the United States with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center : all of the attack 's participants either had served in Afghanistan or were linked to a Brooklyn-based fund-raising organ for the Afghan jihad that was later revealed to be al Qaeda 's de facto U.S. headquarters . The blowback , evident in other countries as well , continued to increase in intensity throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2001 . <p> The current war in Iraq will generate a ferocious blowback of its own , which -- as a recent classified CIA assessment predicts-could be longer and more powerful than that from Afghanistan . Foreign volunteers fighting U.S. troops in Iraq today will find new targets around the world after the war ends . Yet the Bush administration , consumed with managing countless crises in Iraq , has devoted little time to preparing for such long-term consequences . Lieutenant General James Conway , the director of operations on the Joint Staff , admitted as much when he said in June that blowback " is a concern , but there 's not much we can do about it at this point in time . " Judging from the experience of Afghanistan , such thinking is both mistaken and dangerously complacent . COMING HOME TO ROOST <p> The foreign volunteers in Afghanistan saw the Soviet defeat as a victory for Islam against a superpower that had invaded a Muslim country . Estimates of the number of foreign fighters who fought in Afghanistan begin in the low thousands ; some spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to a jihad vacation . The jihadists gained legitimacy and prestige from their triumph both within the militant community and among ordinary Muslims , as well as the confidence to carry their jihad to other countries where they believed Muslims required assistance . When veterans of the guerrilla campaign returned home with their experience , ideology , and weapons , they destabilized once-tranquil countries and inflamed already unstable ones . <p> Algeria had seen relatively little terrorism for decades , but returning mujahideen founded the Armed Islamic Group ( known by its French initials , GIA ) . GIA murdered thousands of Algerian civilians during the 1990s as it attempted to depose the government and replace it with an Islamist regime , a goal inspired by the mujahideen 's success in Afghanistan . The GIA campaign of violence became especially pronounced after the Algerian army mounted a coup in 1992 to preempt an election that Islamists were poised to win . <p> In Egypt , after the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 prompted a government crackdown , hundreds of extremists left the country to train and fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Soviets to lead a terror campaign that killed more than a thousand people between 1990 and 1997 . Closely tied to these militants was the Egyptian cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , " the Blind Sheikh , " whose preaching , according to the 9/11 Commission , had inspired Sadat 's assassins . Abdel Rahman 's career demonstrates the internationalization of Islamist extremism after Afghanistan . The cleric visited Pakistan to lend his support to the Afghan jihad and encouraged two of his sons to fight in the war . He also provided spiritual direction for the Egyptian terrorist organization Jamaat al-Islamiyya and supported its renewed attacks on the Egyptian government in the 1990s . He arrived in the United States in 1990 -- at the time , the country was regarded as a sympathetic environment for Islamist militants -- where he began to encourage attacks on New York City landmarks . Convicted in 1995 in connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , Abdel Rahman is serving a life sentence in the United States . But his influence has continued to be felt : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luxor that left 58 tourists dead and almost crippled Egypt 's vital tourism industry was an effort by Jamaat al-Islamiyya to force his release . <p> The best-known alumnus of the Afghan jihad is Osama bin Laden , under whose leadership the " Afghan Arabs " prosecuted their war beyond the Middle East into the United States , Africa , Europe , and Southeast Asia . After the Soviet defeat , bin Laden established a presence in Sudan to build up his fledgling al Qaeda organization . Around the same time , Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops arrived in Saudi Arabia . The U.S. military presence in " the land of the two holy places " became al Qaeda 's core grievance , and the United States became bin Laden 's primary target . Al Qaeda bombed two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 , nearly sank the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen in 2000 , and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 . Bin Laden expanded his reach into Southeast Asia with the assistance of other terrorists who had fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hambali , who is the central link between al Qaeda and the Indonesian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah , and Ali Gufron , known as Mukhlas , a leading planner of the 2002 Bail bombing that killed more than 200 people . ON-THE-JOB TRAINING <p> The Afghan experience was important for the foreign " holy warriors " for several reasons . First , they gained battlefield experience . Second , they rubbed shoulders with like-minded militants from around the Muslim world , creating a truly global network . Third , as the Soviet war wound down , they established a myriad of new jihadist organizations , from al Qaeda to the Algerian GIA to the Filipino group Abu Sayyaf . <p> However , despite their grandiose rhetoric , the few thousand foreigners who fought in Afghanistan had only a negligible impact on the outcome of that war . Bin Laden 's Afghan Arabs began fighting the Soviet army only in 1986 , six years after the Soviet invasion . It was the Afghans , drawing on the wealth of their American and Saudi sponsors , who defeated the Soviet Union . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more potent than the Afghan Arabs ever were . <p> Several factors could make blowback from the Iraq war even more dangerous than the fallout from Afghanistan . Foreign fighters started to arrive in Iraq even before Saddam 's regime fell . They have conducted most of the suicide bombings -- including some that have delivered strategic successes such as the withdrawal of the UN and most international aid organizations -- and the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , another alumnus of the Afghan war , is perhaps the most effective insurgent commander in the field . Fighters in Iraq are more battle hardened than the Afghan Arabs , who fought demoralized Soviet army conscripts . They are testing themselves against arguably the best army in history , acquiring skills in their battles against coalition forces that will be far more useful for future terrorist operations than those their counterparts learned during the 1980s . Mastering how to make improvised explosive devices or how to conduct suicide operations is more relevant to urban terrorism than the conventional guerrilla tactics used against the Red Army . U.S. military commanders say that techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally , foreign involvement in the Iraqi conflict will likely lead some Iraqi nationals to become international terrorists . The Afghans were glad to have Arab money but were culturally , religiously , and psychologically removed from the Afghan Arabs ; they neither joined al Qaeda nor identified with the Arabs ' radical theology . Iraqis , however , are closer culturally to the foreigners fighting in Iraq , and many will volunteer to continue other jihads even after U.S. troops depart . IN BAGHDAD AND IN BOSTON <p> President George W. Bush and others have suggested that it is better for the United States to fight the terrorists in Baghdad than in Boston . It is a comforting notion , but it is wrong on two counts . First , it posits a finite number of terrorists who can be lured to one place and killed . But the Iraq war has expanded the terrorists ' ranks : the year 2003 saw the highest incidence of significant terrorist attacks in two decades , and then , in 2004 , astonishingly , that number tripled . ( Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror . " An exponentially rising number of terrorist attacks is one metric that seems relevant . ) Second , the Bush administration has not addressed the question of what the foreign fighters will do when the war in Iraq ends . It would be naive to expect them to return to civilian life in their home countries . More likely , they will become the new shock troops of the international jihadist movement . <p> For these reasons , U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East , as well as the United States itself , are vulnerable to blowback . Disturbingly , some European governments are already seeing some of their citizens and resident aliens answer the call to fight in Iraq . In February , the Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. troops in Iraq had detained three French militants -- and that police in Paris had arrested ten associates who were planning to join them . In June , authorities in Spain arrested 16 men , mostly Moroccans , on charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States indicted a Dutch resident , Iraqi-born Wesam al-Delaema , for conspiring to bomb U.S. convoys in Fallujah . These incidents presage danger not only for European countries , but also for the United States , since European nationals benefit from the Visa Waiver Program , which affords them relatively easy access to the United States . <p> But it is Saudi Arabia that will bear the brunt of the blowback . Several studies attest to the significant role Saudi nationals have played in the conflict . Of the 154 Arab fighters killed in Iraq between September 2004 and March 2005 , 61 percent were from Saudi Arabia . Another report concluded that of the 235 suicide bombers named on Web sites since mid-2004 as having perpetrated attacks in Iraq , more than 50 percent were Saudi nationals . Today , the Saudi government is exporting its jihadist problem instead of dealing with it , just as the Egyptians did during the Afghan war . A SWITCH IN TIME <p> American success in Iraq would deny today 's jihadists the symbolic victory that they seek . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the jihadists in Iraq now-by limiting the numbers entering the fight and breaking the mechanism that would otherwise generate blowback after the war . <p> The foreign jihadists in Iraq need to be separated from the local insurgents through the political process . Success in that mission will require Iraq 's Sunni Arabs to remain consistently engaged in the political process . Shiite and Kurdish leaders will have to back down from their efforts to create semiautonomous states in the north and the south . But the prospects for these developments appear dim at the moment , and reaching a durable agreement may increasingly be beyond U.S. influence . <p> To raise the odds of success , the United States must deliver more security to central Iraq . This means securing Iraq 's borders , especially with Syria , to block the flow of foreign fighters into the country . The repeated U.S. military operations in western Iraq since May have shown that at present there are insufficient forces to disrupt insurgent supply lines running along the Euphrates River to the Syrian border . Accomplishing this objective would require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-trained Iraqi troops . For the moment , neither of those options seems viable , and so additional U.S. soldiers should be rotated out of Iraq 's cities and into the western deserts and border towns , transitioning the control of certain urban areas to the Iraqi military and police . <p> Foreign governments must also silence calls to jihad and deny radicals sanctuary once this war ends . After the Soviet defeat , jihadists too often found refuge in places as varied as Brooklyn and Khartoum , where radical clerics offered religious justifications for continuing jihad . To date , some governments have not taken the necessary steps to clamp down on the new generation of jihadists . Although the Saudis largely silenced their radical clerics following the terrorist attacks in Riyadh in May 2003 , 26 clerics were still permitted late in 2004 to call for jihad against U.S. troops in Iraq . The United States must press the Saudi government to end these appeals and restrict its nationals from entering Iraq . In the long run , measures against radical preaching are in Riyadh 's best interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as painful for Saudi Arabia as the blowback from Afghanistan was for Egypt and Algeria during the 1990s . <p> Finally , the U.S. intelligence community , in conjunction with foreign intelligence services , should work on creating a database that identifies and tracks foreign fighters , their known associates , and their spiritual mentors . If such a database had been created during the Afghan war , the United States would have been far better prepared for al Qaeda 's subsequent terror campaign . <p> President Jimmy Carter 's national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , once asked of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan : " What is most important to the history of the world ? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire ? Some stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War ? " Today , the Bush administration is implicitly arguing a similar point : that the establishment of a democratic Iraqi state is a project of overriding importance for the United States and the world , which in due course will eclipse memories of the insurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Iraq is already breeding a new generation of terrorists . The lesson of the decade of terror that followed the Afghan war was that underestimating the importance of blowback has severe consequences . Repeating the mistake in regard to Iraq could lead to even deadlier outcomes . <p> By Peter Bergen and Alec Reynolds <p> <p> Peter Bergen is a Schwartz Fellow of the New America Foundation and the author of Holy War , Inc. : inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden <p> Alec Reynolds is a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University 's School of Advanced International Studies . <p> 
##4002773 Section : Comments Washington Battles the World <p> As historic documents go , the statement issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce on June 30 was low-key even by American standards of informality . No flowery language , no fountain-penned signatures , no Great Seal of the United States -- only 331 words on a single page . But the simplicity of the presentation belied the importance of the content , which was Washington 's attempt to settle a crucial problem of twenty-first-century global governance : Who controls the Internet ? <p> Any network requires some centralized control in order to function . The global phone system , for example , is administered by the world 's oldest international treaty organization , the International Telecommunication Union , founded in 1865 and now a part of the UN family . The Internet is different . It is coordinated by a private-sector nonprofit organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , which was set up by the United States in 1998 to take over the activities performed for 30 years , amazingly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over who controls the Internet has simmered in insular technology-policy circles for years and more recently has crept into formal diplomatic talks . Many governments feel that , like the phone network , the Internet should be administered under a multilateral treaty . ICANN , in their view , is an instrument of American hegemony over cyberspace : its private-sector approach favors the United States , Washington retains oversight authority , and its Governmental Advisory Committee , composed of delegates from other nations , has no real powers . <p> This discontent finally boiled over at the UN 'S World Summit on the Information Society , the first phase of which was held in Geneva in December 2003 ( the second phase is set for November in Tunis ) . Brazil and South Africa have criticized the current arrangement , and China has called for the creation of a new international treaty organization . France wants an intergovernmental approach , but one involving only an elite group of democratic nations . Cuba and Syria have taken advantage of the controversy to poke a finger in Washington 's eye , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling the existing system of Internet governance a form of neocolonialism . <p> How did such a welcomed technology become the source of such discord ? Everyone understands that the Internet is crucial for the functioning of modern economies , societies , and even governments , and everyone has an interest in seeing that it is secure and reliable . But at the same time , many governments are bothered that such a vital resource exists outside their control and , even worse , that it is under the thumb of an already dominant United States . Washington 's answer to these concerns-the Commerce Department 's four terse paragraphs , released at the end of June , announcing that the United States plans to retain control of the Internet indefinitely-was intended as a sort of Monroe Doctrine for our times . It was received abroad with just the anger one would expect , setting the stage for further controversy . MASTERS OF THEIR DOMAIN NAMES <p> One of the most cherished myths of cyberspace is that the Internet is totally decentralized and inherently uncontrollable . Like all myths , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy dose of wishful thinking . It is true that compared with the century-old telephone system , the Internet is a paragon of deregulation and decentralization . In four critical areas , however , it requires oversight and coordination in order to operate smoothly . Together , these areas constitute the " domain name system " of addresses , with which users navigate the Internet and send e-mail . <p> First , there are domain names , such as www.foreignaffairs.org . Somebody must decide who will operate the database of generic names ending with suffixes such as " . com , " " . net , " " . info , " and others ( a privilege that promises handsome profits ) . Also , someone must appoint the operators of two-letter country-code suffixes ( such as " . cn , " for China ) . <p> Second , there are Internet Protocol numbers , the up-to-12-digit codes , invisible to users , that every machine on the network needs to have in order to be recognized by other machines . Due to a technical decision made when the network was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mainframe computers-the system was set up to accommodate only around four billion potential Internet Protocol numbers , far fewer than are now necessary . Until the Internet is upgraded , accordingly , Internet Protocol numbers must be allocated sparingly-and carefully , since accidentally duplicating them creates mayhem for routing Internet traffic . <p> Third are what are called root servers . Some form of control is needed in the actual machines that make the domain name system work . When users visit Web sites or send e-mail , big computers known as root servers match the domain names with their corresponding Internet Protocol numbers in a matter of milliseconds . The database is the world 's most important Rolodex . Yet due to a technical hiccup that occurred when the network was young , there can be only 13 root servers , some of which provide data to mirror sites around the world . As a result , somebody must decide who will operate the root servers and where those operators will be based . Because the system evolved informally , the root servers ' administrators are diverse , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military , and private companies . Today , all told , ten root servers are operated from the United States and one each from Amsterdam , Stockholm , and Tokyo . <p> Fourth and finally , there are technical standards that must be formally established and coordinated to ensure the Internet 's interoperability . They entail more than just the addressing system and involve everything from how routers send traffic to parameters so that video flows smoothly . Ultimately , the standards let the Internet evolve . <p> If all this sounds outrageously technical , that is because it is . And it is the reason why , even after the Internet had become a mass-market medium , most diplomats and foreign policy experts remained largely unaware of these issues . But although the management of the names , numbers , root servers , and standards that constitute the Internet 's infrastructure -- what techies call " Internet governance " -- seems nerdy , it can have an important impact on mainstream policy issues . For instance , countries that place restrictions on the types of domain names that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of registrants of addresses with generic suites such as " . com " and " . net " are made publicly available online , which jeopardizes people 's privacy . Telecom operators need access to Internet Protocol numbers to deploy services , making them a major asset for companies and an economic interest of countries . Technical standards can be designed either to foster openness or to permit censorship and surveillance . In short , the Internet , before it is physically constructed from routers and cables , is made up of values . And the domain name system is the central chokepoint where control of the Internet can be exercised . <p> For most of its history , the Internet has been administered by Woodstock-era American engineers and academics . As a result , the network has embodied the philosophy of that community : a political and economic liberalism led to openness on a technical level . The open infrastructure ( with nonproprietary standards that let any network connect to any other , hence the " inter-net " ) has fostered free expression , low-cost access , and innovation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Internet nonbureaucratic , particularly compared with state-run monopoly telecom carriers . And the fact that the Internet 's networks carry streams of data rather than mainly voice calls has kept it outside of the purview of traditional telecom regulators . <p> To be sure , the Internet 's openness begets big headaches : it is difficult to track spammers , and the system is tremendously vulnerable to hacking . But the open network is like the open society -- crime thrives , but so does creativity . We take for granted that the Internet we enjoy today continue to have these characteristics , but this is hardly certain . It all depends on who controls the domain name system and what priorities they choose to set . THE TANGLED WEB THEY WOVE <p> Until 1998 , the Internet was overseen almost exclusively by one man : Jon Postel , a computer science professor at the University of Southern California . As a graduate student in the 1960s , he was among the handful of engineers who built the Internet . For the next 30 years , he managed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Projects Agency , which funded the Internet 's initial development . <p> Postel made seemingly technical decisions such as who should get to operate a country-code domain . Although it may seem odd that national address suffixes ( such as " . uk , " for the United Kingdom ) were allocated to private individuals rather than government bodies , such was the case . In its early days , the Internet was so new and strange that there was usually no appropriate national organization to hand a suffix to . Besides , governments , and particularly their monopoly telecom carriers , more often hindered communications development than helped it . By the mid-1990s , however , it became clear to the small coterie of officials in the United States and elsewhere who were aware of the matter that the Internet could no longer be administered by a single individual . But who or what would replace him ? <p> After a bitter series of negotiations among the business community , governments , and nongovernmental organizations worldwide , the Clinton administration helped broker a compromise and established ICANN in 1998 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet to flourish , it seemed appropriate that the new organization be based in the private sector . This would make it more responsive , more flexible , and less prone to bureaucratic and political squabbling . The negotiations were so tense that Postel suffered a heart attack as they were ending and never lived to see the birth of the successor organization he was instrumental in creating . <p> ICANN was an experiment , a bottom-up , multi-stakeholder approach toward managing a global resource on a nongovernmental basis . Indeed , in its early days it was often touted as a model for other issues that require the unified action of numerous groups from government , industry , and civil society , such as treating communicable diseases or handling climate change . ICANN 'S private-sector status , moreover , has helped keep the Internet free from political interference . When in 2002 members of the Federal Communications Commission were asked by their counterparts at Chinas Ministry of Information industry why Taiwan had been allocated its own two-letter domain ( " . tw " ) , the commissioners could pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet from the start , ICANN was plagued by controversy . Critics charged that it lacked transparency , accountability , and legitimacy . Civil-society groups felt it was in the pocket of the domain name registration businesses it was designed to regulate . Businesses felt it was overly governmental . And foreign governments felt powerless before it . As many developing countries woke to the Internet 's importance , it struck them as outrageous that the Internet was essentially run by a nonprofit corporation whose 15-person board of directors was accountable to the attorney general of the state of California and under the authority of the U.S. government . Even the U.S. Congress criticized it , hauling the group into tense hearings regularly . Haft a decade after it was founded with such optimism , the organization was mockingly referred to in tech-policy circles as " ICAN N'T . " <p> All this came to a head in 2003 , during the preparatory meetings for the World Summit on the Information Society . Washington had been able to deflect criticism of ICANN in bilateral discussions but proved unable to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials mildly supportive of ICANN were replaced by senior representatives from foreign ministries , officials less familiar with the details of Internet governance but more experienced in challenging U.S. power . Watching the United States go to war in Iraq despite global opposition , these diplomats saw ICANN as yet another example of American unilateralism . What would prevent Washington , they argued , from one day choosing , say , to knock Iran off the Internet by simply deleting its two-letter moniker , " . ir , " from the domain name system ? Surely the Internet ought to be managed by the international community rather than a single nation . <p> Governments worldwide sought to dilute the United States ' control by calling for a new arrangement , and in November 2004 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed a 40-person working group to address questions of Internet governance . Washington had planned to grant ICANN autonomy from its oversight in 2006 . But the more other countries clamored for power , the more the United States reconsidered its policy of relinquishing control . Ultimately , it came down to national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet 's continuing to function as it had , decided it was not prepared to risk any changes . So , as the UN working group was preparing to release its report ( which , unsurprisingly , favored transferring authority over the Internet to the UN ) , the U.S. government made a preemptive strike . In the brief Commerce Department statement , Washington announced its decision : the United States would retain its authority over ICANN , period . THE OPEN NETWORK AND ITS ENEMIES <p> Power , before it comes from arms or wealth , emanates from ideas . The Internet has emerged as a piece of critical information infrastructure for every nation . Developed countries increasingly rely on it for their economic livelihood and basic communications ; developing nations recognize it as a way of linking people together , enabling commercial relationships , and generating the transparency and civic dialogue that undergird democratic governance . Information technology can also strengthen the hand of authoritarian regimes , but there seems little doubt that in its current form the Internet 's general influence is progressive rather than regressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the group 's work has ensured that the network operates smoothly so that these benefits can be realized . As the overseer of the domain name system , the United States has taken a liberal approach in keeping with its liberal values . There is no guarantee that an intergovernmental system would continue on such a course , and so even committed internationalists ought to be wary of changing how the system is run . <p> This is especially so since the very countries that most restrict the Internet within their borders are the ones calling loudest for greater control . As other countries sharpen their diplomatic knives for the final round of the summit in Tunis in November , the dispute is echoing an earlier battle at UNESCO in the 1980s over the so-called New World Information and Communication Order , which led the United States and the United Kingdom to pull out of the organization . Then , it was the Soviet Union , its satellites , and the developing world that called for controlling media activities and funding the development of media resources in developing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Internet , as well as financial aid to overcome the digital divide . <p> Washington 's new position shrewdly mixes a few carrots in along with the big stick . It formally acknowledges that countries have " sovereignty concerns " about their national two-letter address domains-a mealy-mouthed nod toward granting countries control over them , which is only appropriate . Although this will invite problems , such as with Taiwan 's " . tw , " these can be sidestepped -- just as the allocation of telephone " country codes " to territories does not confer diplomatic recognition , neither does the allocation of country domains need to . Washington also supports the continued discussion of broader Internet governance issues in multiple forums , which could restrain the creation of a cumbersome and monolithic Global Internet Policy Council ( which was among the UN working group 's proposals ) . It may also keep politicians from trespassing on ICANN 'S more purely technical areas , which could harm the network . <p> Nevertheless , although the new U.S. position may be the least bad alternative in the short term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . For the moment , there is little other governments can do to rebel . Unless they feel their concerns are being addressed , however , they are likely to try to set up a parallel naming and addressing system to compete with ICANN-sanctioned domains . Technology abhors homogeneity ; differing technical standards are the norm rather than the exception . The ongoing scuffle over the creation of Galileo , Europe 's challenge to Washington 's Global Positioning System , is one example ; the battle over third-generation mobile-phone standards is another . The danger , however , is that two different addressing systems on the Internet may not interoperate perfectly . If it wants to preserve and extend the benefits the Internet currently brings , Washington will have to come up with some way of sharing control with other countries without jeopardizing the network 's stability or discouraging free speech and technical innovation . <p> Ultimately , what is playing out is a clash of perspectives . The U.S. government saw the creation of ICANN as the voluntary relinquishing of a critical source of power in the digital age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain its hegemony by placing Internet governance in the U.S. private sector . Foreign critics think a shift to multilateral intergovernmental control would mark a step toward enlightened global democracy ; Washington thinks it would constitute a step back in time , toward state-regulated telecommunications . Whether and how these perspectives are bridged will determine the future of a global resource that nearly all of us have come to take for granted . <p> By Kenneth Nell Cukier <p> <p> Kenneth Neil Cukier covers technology and regulatory issues for The Economist . <p> 
##4002774 Section : Comments Yielding to Balkan Reality <p> Amid the unraveling of Yugoslavia that began in the early 1990s , the United States and its European allies have staunchly defended multiethnic society in the Balkans . The military interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo , the ongoing peacekeeping missions there , the hundreds of millions of dollars given annually in economic aid-these sacrifices have been made to preserve the individual states that once constituted a federal Yugoslavia and to prevent bloodshed among the numerous ethnic groups that populate them . Now , however , the time has come to let pragmatism triumph over principle -- and move derisively toward independence for Kosovo . <p> The most important piece of unfinished business in the Balkans is the final status of Kosovo , the southern province of Serbia , which has been under international trusteeship since NATO 'S intervention in 1999 . Anxious to scale back its obligations in the region and confronted with growing impatience among Kosovo 's population , the international community is finally gearing up for negotiations over Kosovo 's political future , as provided for under UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosovo is an ancestral homeland and the site of many important Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries , insist that the area remain under Serbian sovereignty . Broader opposition to separating Kosovo from Serbia stems from concern about the potential precedent that would be set by redrawing boundaries along ethnic lines and the likely impact this move would have on the integrity of the borders of Macedonia , Montenegro , and Bosnia . <p> Nevertheless , harsh realities on the ground make independence for Kosovo the only viable option . In the current state of limbo , relations between the Albanian majority , which is mostly Muslim , and the Serbian minority , which is mostly Orthodox Christian , have reached the boiling point . The Albanian leadership in Pristina , which governs Kosovo in an uneasy partnership with UN authorities , wants nothing to do with Belgrade . Kosovo has already left Serbia 's orbit . And throughout the area , walls of hostility divide ordinary Albanians and Serbs . In spirit as well as fact , multiethnic society is nowhere to be found . <p> Pretending otherwise and denying or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is therefore the greater of two evils . The formal separation of Kosovo from Serbia instead offers the best hope for rebuilding moderation and tolerance among ethnic Albanians , making it far more likely that they will eventually live in peace with Serbs , Roma , and the other minority groups among them . A HOUSE DIVIDED <p> Driving from central Serbia into Kosovo already feels like crossing a national boundary , and a militarized one at that : Serbian border guards , then a no man 's land , then a border control staffed by Kosovo police as well as UN and NATO personnel . In the no man 's land , drivers change their license plates ; cars with Serbian tags will sometimes be attacked in Kosovo , and those with Kosovar plates are equally at risk in Serbia . <p> In Kosovo , signs abound that the area has been poisoned by intercommunal violence . NATO troops , armed UN guards , and members of the Kosovo Police Service are ubiquitous , keeping the palpable ethnic tensions in check . Serbs live in fortified enclaves , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , two of Kosovo 's largest cities , Pristina and Prizren , were home to tens of thousands of Serbs . They are now virtually Serb-free . A few smaller towns , such as Orahovac , have maintained their multiethnic character , but the Serbs there live in isolated ghettos , set off from Albanian neighborhoods by a block or two of burned-out homes . Serbs rarely venture into the Albanian section of town , fearful of abuse or worse . <p> Roughly 90 percent of Kosovo 's population of some two million is ethnic Albanian , and most of the rest of the population is Serbian . This ethnic imbalance was long in the making , a result primarily of successive Serbian exoduses to the north during the Ottoman era and , more recently , higher birthrates among Albanians . Since World War II , political power has shifted back and forth between the two communities . In Tito 's Yugoslavia , Kosovo 's Albanians enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy . Beginning in the late 1980s , Serbia 's nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic tightened Belgrade 's grip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Milosevic responded to armed Albanian resistance with a campaign of ethnic cleansing that began in 1998 , kilting at least l0,000 Albanians and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes . <p> After NATO 's intervention and the eventual withdrawal of Serbian forces , ethnic Albanians exacted their revenge . During the war and the retribution that followed , at least a thousand Serbs were killed , while tens of thousands fled ; their ransacked homes , stores , and churches still mar the landscape . To this day , Albanians continue to dish back the ethnic discrimination they suffered during the 1990s . In many Serbian enclaves , no one holds a steady job ; the communities rely on handouts from aid organizations and from Belgrade . As one Serbian resident of Orahovac told me in July , " We do n't call this life , we call it an imitation of life . " <p> Although outbreaks of actual ethnic violence are now uncommon , Serbs remain on guard . In March 2004 , Albanians rioted across Kosovo , leading to widespread attacks on Serbs , forcing thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in repairing intercommunal ties . This past August , two Serbs were killed in a drive-by shooting . <p> The communities are so polarized that simple dialogue is hard to find . In a conversation with Serbian residents in Lipljan , one of the few multiethnic towns left near Pristina , a participant invited passing Albanians to join the discussion . One after another scurried away . " Most Albanians are no longer willing to have contact with us , " a Serb commented . In Prizren , about 35 miles southwest of Lipljan , one of the few remaining Serbs there explained that she still meets with Albanian friends behind closed doors . " But in public , they pretend not to recognize me , " she lamented , " as it is not good for Albanians to be seen with Serbs . " <p> By any measure , the political conditions in Kosovo fall well short of the standards that the international community has set as preconditions for moving to final-status negotiations . Serbs do not enjoy freedom of movement , one of the main reasons that only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The process of decentralization meant to empower local communities has proved stillborn . Political and legal institutions have yet to mature , stymied by infighting among political parties , crime and corruption , and patronage systems deeply embedded in the clannish structure of Albanian society . Poverty is pervasive , with unemployment topping 5o percent even among ethnic Albanians . An inadequate power supply makes for daily blackouts , and Kosovo 's uncertain political stares leaves it unable to attract the foreign capital it needs to invest in basic infrastructure . <p> The case for independence , however , rests not on Kosovo 's readiness , but on the lack of realistic alternatives . Ethnic Albanians are now in command , and they are adamant about breaking away from Serbia . As Kosovo 's prime minister , Bajram Kosumi , made clear in his office in Pristina , " The people of Kosovo will decide their own future . . If Kosovo does not become independent , there will be serious consequences . " Kosovo 's Albanians have reached their limits ; the atrocities and injustices of the past , combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but impossible to envisage the continuation of Serbian sovereignty . Unfortunately , continued sovereignty is exactly what the Serbian government has in mind . BLIND ALLEYS <p> " Less than independence , more than autonomy , " Serbia 's president , Boris Tadic , explained in a meeting in Belgrade . Under his formula , Kosovo would largely manage its own affairs but remain nominally a part of Serbia and forgo diplomatic representation abroad . " The independence of Kosovo is unacceptable for me , and for all of Serbia , " he insisted . Tadic and his advisers fear that an independent Kosovo would imperil not only the Serbs living there , but also the course of democracy in Serbia itself . " Independence will drive a stake through the heart of Serbian democracy , " one of Tadic 's top aides said . The president agreed , noting that " if independence is imposed on Serbia , we will once more become a black hole of the Balkans . The Radicals extreme nationalists will be elected . And they will stay in power for a generation . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage to Serbia 's inability to trust itself to behave responsibly . The United States and its European partners were too timid in confronting Serbian nationalism throughout most of the 1990s , and much blood was shed as a result . The international community should not make the same mistake today . Serbia 's darker instincts need to be extinguished , not accommodated . <p> It is true that extreme nationalists might come to power in Serbia in the wake of Kosovo 's independence . But if Belgrade becomes more belligerent , turns its back on the war crimes tribunal operating in The Hague , and veers away from integration into Europe , Serbs will only find their country more isolated and impoverished . By making clear that the nationalist agenda has been leading the country down a blind alley , Serbia 's loss of sovereignty over Kosovo could well result in the strengthening of Serbian centrists . <p> Rather than threatening doomsday scenarios if Kosovo becomes independent , Serbia 's leaders should be doing just the opposite : talking about life after separation and preparing the public accordingly . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic , has publicly endorsed letting Kosovo go . Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and President Tadic , both of whom have the nationalist credentials necessary to call for moderation and compromise , have failed to rise to the occasion . <p> Instead , the Serbian government has encouraged Kosovar Serbs to boycott elections in the province and distance themselves from Pristina , only intensifying the Serbian minority 's political isolation . Belgrade has played down Serbia 's culpability in the ethnic violence of the 1990s , tolerating nationalist myths and strengthening popular belief in the inviolability of Serbia 's territorial claims . Belgrade is correct to worry about how Kosovar Serbs would fare after independence , but its behavior has done little either to strengthen its case for keeping Kosovo in the fold or to ready its citizens for the impending loss of their southern province . MAKING THE INEVITABLE TOLERABLE <p> As it eases Kosovo away from Serbian sovereignty , the international community should make independence contingent on three conditions . First , Pristina must make substantial progress on putting in place the essentials of a functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law , clamp down on corruption and crime , and redress widespread poverty and unemployment . <p> Second , Pristina must do much more to ensure the well-being of those Serbs who choose to stay put . Many Serbs intend to quit Kosovo if it becomes independent simply as a matter of principle . To encourage them to remain , ethnic Albanian leaders will need to capitalize on the prospect of independence to promote tolerance and protect minority rights . Reviving multiethnicity will become easier as Kosovo formally moves beyond Belgrade 's reach , enabling Albanian moderates to neutralize militant voices . As Ruzhdi Saramati , a former brigade commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army , put it in a meeting in Prizren , " Independence will help end extremist elements within the Albanian community . " <p> As part of its effort to safeguard minority rights , Pristina should also agree to put Christian sites throughout Kosovo under international supervision . Well over a hundred churches and monasteries have been destroyed or damaged since 1999 , many of them during the 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded by NATO troops and barbed wire . To ensure that they remain secure and accessible , these sites should be given international protection for the indefinite future . <p> Third -- and most controversial -- the international community should reconsider its blanket opposition to the partition of Kosovo , indicating instead that it is prepared to accept partition provided that Pristina and Belgrade both consent . From the Ibar River north to the boundary with Serbia proper , Kosovo is populated almost exclusively by Serbs . The area is about 15 percent of Kosovo 's territory and contains about one-third of its Serbs . Pristina makes no pretense of governing the region , which in most respects remains functionally a part of Serbia . <p> Granting northern Kosovo to Serbia while the rest of the province becomes independent would relieve Pristina of the futile task of trying to assert control over a region that , come what may , intends to maintain its links to Belgrade . In Mitrovica , the areas main city , Albanian and Serbian communities already reside on opposite sides of the Ibar , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of Kosovo . As long as Pristina is disabused of any hope of swapping northern Kosovo for Albanian enclaves in southern Serbia , partition would also represent a compromise of sorts , enabling Belgrade to claim that it has not been left empty-handed . As one of President Tadic 's advisers stated , " If we are looking for a compromise solution , partition seems to be the easy way out . " <p> Many in the international community insist that the partition of Kosovo along ethnic lines would send a dangerous signal , condoning ethnic segregation and fueling fragmentation elsewhere in the Balkans . This argument is not without merit . It would have been best if the peoples of the former Yugoslavia had been able to live together amicably in a unitary state . The breakup of Yugoslavia certainly violated the civic values on which multiethnic society rests -- as would the independence and partition of Kosovo .

With or without the territory north of the Ibar , Kosovo 's independence promises to stabilize Macedonia by forestalling the radicalization of its ethnic Albanians and neutralizing Albanian extremists throughout the region . Even if it does not , it is Macedonia 's treatment of its Albanian minority that will do more to stabilize ( or destabilize ) the country than developments elsewhere . And although ethnic tensions continue to bedevil Bosnia , its future , like Montenegro 's , will be little affected by Kosovo 's ultimate political status or boundaries . <p> It is well worth keeping the option of Kosovo 's partition on the table , therefore , especially if doing so would provide Belgrade with sufficient inducement to make a deal .

Russia and China , both of which struggle with separatist movements at home , are unlikely to relish an outcome that effectively embraces secession along ethnic lines . But neither country has compelling interests in the Balkans . Russia 's affinity for its Slavic brethren in Serbia is of minimal political consequence , and both Moscow and Beijing are intent on maintaining good relations with the United States and Europe .

##4002775 Section : Reviews &; Responses Review Essay Who Says Democracies Do n't Fight ? PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Seldom if ever has the hostility between academics and the U.S. president been so pronounced . Of course , political scientists always seem to complain about the occupant of the White House , and Republicans fare worse than Democrats : Herbert Hoover was called callous , Dwight Eisenhower a dunce , Richard Nixon evil , Ronald Reagan dangerous , and George H.W. Bush out of touch . But professors have consigned George W. Bush to a special circle of their presidential hell . And the White House seems to return the sentiment . <p> According to the academics , Bush 's chief transgressions have had to do with foreign policy , especially the Iraq war -- a mess that could have been avoided if only the president and his advisers had paid more attention to those who devote their lives to studying international relations . <p> The irony of this argument is that few other presidents -- certainly none since Woodrow Wilson , a former president of the American Political Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied their foreign policies more explicitly to the work of social science . The defining act of Bush 's presidency was grounded in a theory that the political scientist Jack Levy once declared was " as close as anything we have to an empirical law in international relations , " namely , that democracies do not fight one another . <p> The theory , which originated in the work of the eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant and was refined in the 1970s and 1980s by several researchers working independently , has , since the 1990s , been one of the hottest research areas in international relations . Although some skeptics remain and no one agrees about why exactly it works , most academics now share the belief that democracies have indeed made a separate peace . What is more , much research suggests that they are also unusually likely to sign and honor international agreements and to become economically interdependent . <p> The administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton made frequent appeals to the theory in public , and it seems to have informed their support for democratization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , however , has gone much further in its faith in the idea , betting the farm that the theory holds and will help Washington achieve a peaceful , stable , and prosperous Muslim world as , over time , Iraq 's neighbors , following Iraq 's example , democratize . The United States ' real motives for attacking Iraq may have been complex , but " regime change " -the replacement of Saddam Hussein 's gruesome tyranny with a democracy-was central to Washington 's rhetoric by the time it began bombing Baghdad in March 2003 . <p> Why has a president who set his defining policy around one of political science 's crown jewels come in for so much venom from the same academics who endorse the idea ? After all , a host of peer-reviewed journal articles have implicitly supported the president 's claim that a democratic Iraq would not threaten the United States or Israel , develop weapons of mass destruction , or sponsor terrorism . Are professors simply perpetual critics who refuse to take responsibility for the consequences of their ideas ? Or does Bush hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break with its predecessors and alter the authoritarian status quo in the Middle East was admirable . But the White House got its science wrong , or at least not completely right : the democratic peace theory does not dictate that the United States can or should remake Iraq into a democracy . In Electing to Fight : Why Emerging Democracies Go to War , the veteran political scientists Edward Mansfield and Jack Snyder make two critical points . Not only is turning authoritarian countries into democracies extremely difficult , much more so than the administration seems to have anticipated . The Middle East could also become a much more dangerous place if Washington and the rest of the world settle for a merely semi-democratic regime in Baghdad . Such an Iraq , Mansfield and Snyder imply , would be uncommonly likely to start wars -- a bull in the Middle Eastern china shop . Unfortunately , such an Iraq may also be just what we are likely to end up with . ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES <p> At first glance , the realists ' critique of the Iraq war is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , realism -- which holds that a country 's type of government has no systematic effects on its foreign policy -- is enjoying a revival in Washington these days , precisely because of the war . According to the realists , the best way to have dealt with Saddam would have been not to overthrow him but to use coercive bargaining : to have threatened him with annihilation , for example , if he ever used nuclear weapons . <p> Even the democratic peace theory , however , does not necessarily prescribe the use of force to transform despotisms such as Iraq into democracies . Indeed , by itself , the argument that democracies do not fight one another does not have any practical implications for the foreign policymaker . It needs an additional or minor premise , such as " the United States can make Iraq into a democracy at an acceptable cost . " And it is precisely this minor premise about which the academy has been skeptical . No scholarly consensus exists on how countries become democratic , and the literature is equally murky on the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free . <p> This last part of the puzzle is even more complicated than it first appears . Enter Mansfield and Snyder , who have been contributing to the democratic peace debate for a decade . Their thesis , first published in 1995 , is that although mature democracies do not fight one another , democratizing states -- those in transition from authoritarianism to democracy-do , and are even more prone to war than authoritarian regimes . Now , in Electing to Fight , the authors have refined their argument . As they outline in the book , not only are " incomplete democratizing " states -- those that develop democratic institutions in the wrong order -- unlikely ever to complete the transition to democracy ; they are also especially bellicose . <p> According to Mansfield and Snyder , in countries that have recently started to hold free elections but that lack the proper mechanisms for accountability ( institutions such as an independent judiciary , civilian control of the military , and protections for opposition parties and the press ) , politicians have incentives to pursue policies that make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such places , politicians know they can mobilize support by demanding territory or other spoils from foreign countries and by nurturing grievances against outsiders . As a result , they push for extraordinarily belligerent policies . Even states that develop democratic institutions in the right order -- adopting the rule of law before holding elections-are very aggressive in the early years of their transitions , although they are less so than the first group and more likely to eventually turn into full democracies . <p> Of course , politicians in mature democracies are also often tempted to use nationalism and xenophobic rhetoric to buttress their domestic power . In such cases , however , they are usually restrained by institutionalized mechanisms of accountability . Knowing that if they lead the country into a military defeat or quagmire they may be punished at the next election , politicians in such states are less likely to advocate a risky war . In democratizing states , by contrast , politicians know that they are insulated from the impact of bad policies : if a war goes badly , for example , they can declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , and so on . Politicians in such states also tend to fear their militaries , which often crave foreign enemies and will overthrow civilian governments that do not share their goals . Combined , these factors can make the temptation to attack another state irresistible . <p> Mansfield and Snyder present both quantitative and case-study support for their theory . Using rigorous statistical methods , the authors show that since 1815 , democratizing states have indeed been more prone to start wars than either democracies or authoritarian regimes . Categorizing transitions according to whether they ended in full democracies ( as in the U.S. case ) or in partial ones ( as in Germany in 1871-1918 or Pakistan throughout its history ) , the authors find that in the early years of democratic transitions , partial democracies -- especially those that get their institutions in the wrong order -- are indeed significantly more likely to initiate wars . Mansfield and Snyder then provide several succinct stories of democratizing states that did in fact go to war , such as the France of Napoleon III ( 1852-70 ) , Serbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2000 , and Pakistan from 1947 to the present . In most of these cases , the authors find what they expect : in these democratizing states , domestic political competition was intense . Politicians , wing for power , appeased domestic hard-liners by resorting to nationalistic appeals that vilified foreigners , and these policies often led to wars that were not in the countries ' strategic interests . <p> Although their argument would have been strengthened by a few comparative studies of democratizing states avoiding war and of flail democracies and authoritarian states starting wars , Mansfield and Snyder are persuasive . In part this is because they carefully circumscribe their claims . They acknowledge that some cases are " false positives , " that is , wars started by states that have wrongly been classified as democratizing , such as the Iran-Iraq War , started by Iraq in 1980 . They also answer the most likely objections to their argument . Some skeptics , for example , might counter that Mansfield and Snyder get the causality reversed : it is war or the threat of it that prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratizing states become involved in more wars simply because their internal instability tempts foreign states to attack them -- in other words , that democratizers are more sinned against than sinning . Analyzing data from 1816 through 1992 , Mansfield and Snyder put paid to these alternative explanations . Bad domestic institutions usually precede wars , rather than vice versa , and democratizing states usually do the attacking . <p> Where does Electing to Fight leave realism , the dominant theory of international conflict ? The quantitative data support the realist claims that major powers are more likely to go to war than minor ones and that the more equal are the great powers , the more likely are wars among them . But democratization makes war more likely even after one takes these factors into account . Furthermore , the case studies suggest that democratizing states very often lose more than they gain from the wars they begin , which implies that they do not respond to international incentives as rationally as realism would expect . That said , notwithstanding its preference for viewing states from the inside , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that it assumes that politicians and other actors are rationally self-interested . Their self-interest simply involves building and maintaining domestic power as well as external security -- and sometimes trading some of the latter in order to gain the former . <p> The authors ' conclusions for foreign policy are straightforward . The United States and other international actors should continue to promote democracy , but they must strive to help democratizing states implement reforms in the correct order . In particular , popular elections ought not to precede the building of institutions that will check the baleful incentives for politicians to call for war . Mansfield and Snyder are unsparing toward well-intentioned organizations that have pressured authoritarian governments to rush to elections in the past -- often with disastrous consequences . As the authors show , for example , it was organizations such as the World Bank and the National Democratic Institute that pushed Burundi and Rwanda to increase popular sovereignty in the early 1990s -- pressure that , as Mansfield and Snyder argue , helped set off a chain of events that led to genocide . Acknowledging their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 1968 book Political Order in Changing Societies ) and Fareed Zakaria , Mansfield and Snyder have written a deeply conservative book . Sounding like Edmund Burke on the French Revolution but substituting statistics and measured prose for rhetorical power , the authors counsel against abruptly empowering people , since premature elections may well usher in domestic upheavals that thrust the state outward against its neighbors . BACK IN BAGHDAD <p> This brings the conversation back to Iraq , and in particular the notion that the United States can turn it into a democracy at an acceptable cost . in effect , Mansfield and Snyder have raised the estimate of these costs by pointing out one other reason this effort may fail -- a reason that few seem to have thought of . Forget for a moment the harrowing possibility of a Sunni-Shiite-Kurdish civil war in Iraq . Set aside the prospect of a Shiite-dominated state aligning itself with Iran , Syria , and Lebanon 's Hezbollah . What if , following the departure of U.S. troops , Iraq holds together but as an incomplete democratizer , with broad suffrage but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own citizens better than the Baathist regime did . Its treatment of its neighbors , however , might be just as bad . <p> Although Saddam was an unusually bellicose and reckless tyrant , attacking Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990 and engaging in foolish brinkmanship with the United States , as Mansfield and Snyder imply , a democratic Iraq may be no less bellicose and reckless . In the near future , intensely competitive elites there -- secularists , leftists , moderates , and both Shiite and Sunni Islamists-could compete for popularity by stirring up nationalism against one or more of Iraq 's neighbors . And Iraq lives in a dangerous neighborhood . Already , Iraqi Shiite parties have been critical of Sunni-dominated Jordan ; Iraqi Sunni parties , of Shiite-dominated Iran ; and Iraqi Kurdish parties , of Turkey . <p> One hopes that the White House contemplated this scenario prior to March 2003 . Whether it did or not , the possibility must be considered now , by U.S. civilian and military leaders , academics , and U.S. allies who agree with those academics . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , incompletely democratized states , the stakes of Iraq 's transition are higher than most have supposed . They are high enough , in fact , that those who called so loudly in the 1990s for an end to UN sanctions because Iraqis were dying but who are silent about the Iraqis who are dying now ought to reconsider their proud aloofness from the war . An aggressive Iraq , prone to attack Kuwait , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Syria , or Israel , is in no one 's interest . The odds may be long that Iraq will ever turn into a mature democracy of the sort envisaged by the Bush administration . But those odds are lengthened by the refusal of those states in Europe and the Middle East that could make a difference actually to do so . <p> By John M. Owen <p> <p> John M.

##4000152 Section : Articles <p> We quantified the threats facing 488 species in Canada , categorized by COSEWIC ( Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada ) as extinct , extirpated , endangered , threatened , or of special concern . Habitat loss is the most prevalent threat ( 84% ) , followed by overexploitation ( 32% ) , native species interactions ( 31% ) , natural causes ( 27% ) , pollution ( 26% ) , and introduced species ( 22% ) . Agriculture ( 46% ) and urbanization ( 44% ) are the most common human activities causing habitat loss and pollution . For extant species , the number of threats per species increases with the level of endangerment . The prevalence of threat types varies among major habitats , with overexploitation being particularly important , and introduced species particularly unimportant , for marine species . Introduced species are a much less important threat in Canada than in the United States , but the causes of endangerment are broadly similar for Canadian and globally endangered species . <p> Keywords : endangered species ; threats ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are altering the natural world at an unprecedented scale , causing global extinction rates to rise by an estimated three or four orders of magnitude ( Pimm et al . 1995 , May and Tregonning 1998 ) . A worldwide effort to slow or stop this loss of biodiversity is under way , including identification of biodiversity " hotspots " ( Myers N et al . 2000 , Roberts et al . 2002 ) , development of a global protected area network ( Rodrigues et al . 2004a , 2004b ) , prevention of the spread of exotic species ( Myers JH et al . 2000 , Pimentel et al . 2000 , Blackburn and Duncan 2001 ) , and reduction of overexploitation ( Bodmer et al . 1997 , Rosser and Mainka 2002 , Brashares et al . 2004 ) . <p> Information about which species are at risk and what factors threaten their existence is of central importance to planning a successful strategy to slow the loss of the world 's biota . Numerous studies have investigated the threats to endangered species in the United States ( Czech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al . 1998 ) . Collectively , they identify habitat loss , followed by introduced species , as the most common cause of endangerment . It appears , however , that there is strong geographic variation in the causes of endangerment . For instance , in China , overexploitation , not habitat loss , is the major threat to endangered vertebrates ( Yiming and Wilcove 2005 ) . Furthermore , most of the world 's imperiled amphibians are declining for unknown reasons , probably related to disease and climate change ( Stuart et al . 2004 ) . Given such regional variation in patterns of threat , a national conservation strategy needs to be informed by analyses conducted at a national level , recognizing that not all species on national lists will be endangered globally . <p> The Canadian parliament recently passed the country 's most important endangered species legislation , the Species at Risk Act ( SARA ) . Under SARA , the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada ( COSEWIC ) is charged with producing , updating , and maintaining an official list of species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COSEWIC are reviewed by the minister of the environment before being granted protection under SARA . But although work is under way to identify Canada 's endangered species , until now no attempt has been made to quantify the threats facing these species , with one notable exception : Kerr and Cihlar ( 2004 ) used remote sensing data to correlate agriculture and agricultural pollution with endangered species density in Canada . However , this analysis was unable to assess the importance of other threats , such as nonagricultural forms of habitat loss and pollution , introduced species , overexploitation , native species interactions , and natural causes . <p> Here we quantify the major threats to Canada 's endangered species . We categorize these causes of endangerment at a broad scale to illustrate general trends and to investigate whether the threats differ among major taxonomic groups or habitat types . We use finer-scale categories of habitat loss and pollution , divided into functional categories of human activity ( agriculture , extraction , urbanization , infrastructure , and human disturbance ) , to determine the ultimate causes of species endangerment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those in the United States ( Wilcove et al . 1998 ) and worldwide ( Baille et al . 2004 ) . Data source and collection <p> Data on the threats ( also called " causes of endangerment " ) to Canada 's extinct , extirpated , endangered , threatened , and special-concern species ( hereafter referred to simply as " endangered " ) were gathered from COSEWIC ( 2006 ) . Following COSEWIC 's definition , we considered a " species " to be any indigenous species , subspecies , variety , or genetically or geographically distinct population of wild flora or fauna . Data were gathered in June 2005 , at which time COSEWIC had identified 500 endangered species from 12 taxa : vascular plants , freshwater fishes , birds , terrestrial mammals , reptiles , marine mammals , molluscs , amphibians , lepidopterans , marine fishes , mosses , and lichens ( table 1 ) . <p> Information provided by COSEWIC was gathered from three sources : ( 1 ) COSEWIC species status reports , ( 2 ) COSEWIC species executive summaries , and ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports and executive summaries are written by independent authors and reviewed by COSEWIC 's Species Specialist Groups . As part of its work on species at risk , the CWS ( 2006 ) summarizes the original COSEWIC reports . When the authors of a report identified a threat as " potential " or " hypothetical , " we did not include it as a known threat . We made no attempt to differentiate between historical and current threats , nor between major and minor threats , as this information was almost always unavailable . We were able to gather data on the threats facing 488 endangered species ( 98% ) . Of the remaining 12 species , 8 had only hypothetical or potential threats , and 4 had no identified threats . <p> Following the threat categories recognized by IUCN ( World Conservation Union ) , we grouped the threats to endangered species into six broad categories : habitat loss , introduced species , overexploitation , pollution , native species interactions , and natural causes ( table 2 ) . To provide a more detailed account of the threats to Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table 3 ) ; this was possible for 398 of the 488 species included in this study . <p> COSEWIC status reports are the best source of information on the threats to Canada 's endangered species . However , these reports have at least two limitations . First , the authors may have biases toward listing some threats over others , biases that may differ between taxa or major habitat types . Second , although COSEWIC compiles and analyzes the best available data for each species , its sources are often not of an experimental or even a quantitative nature . We can make no assumptions about how these limitations have influenced our findings . <p> A one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used to test whether the average number of threats per species differed among levels of endangerment . Chi-squared tests were used to test for differences in the frequency of the broadscale threats among habitat types , between Canada and the world , and between Canada and the United States . In general , alpha was set at 0.05 for two-tailed tests , but was corrected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Canada and the world , and to 0.01 when comparing Canada and the United States . All analyses were done using SPSS 7.0 ( SPSS 1997 ) . Threats to endangered species <p> Habitat loss , affecting 84% of species , is the greatest threat to endangered species in Canada ( figure 1 ) . Introduced species ( 22% ) , overexploitation ( 32% ) , pollution ( 26% ) , native species interactions ( 31% ) , and natural causes ( 27% ) all affect much smaller proportions of species . Surprisingly , pollution and introduced species , both of which are widely believed to be major causes of species endangerment ( Wilson 1992 ) , are less important than either native species interactions or natural causes , neither of which are even listed as potential threats in similar studies ( Wilcove et al . 1998 ) . <p> Figure 1 . The percentage of endangered species in Canada ( n = 488 ) identified by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in June 2005 as threatened by habitat loss , introduced species , overexploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Few species ( 30% ) are threatened by only a single cause of endangerment . On average , endangered species face 2.2 of the 6 broadscale threats . The number of threats facing a species varies significantly among levels of endangerment ( ANOVA : F ( 3,484 ) = 5.79 , p = 0.001 ) , increasing from special concern to threatened to endangered species ( 1.99 , 2.22 , and 2.44 , respectively ) . The combined category of extinct and extirpated species has the fewest threats ( 1.94 ) . Because 57% of extinct and extirpated species have not been sighted in the past 50 years ( COSEWIC 2006 ) , the paucity of identified threats for these species is most likely attributable to our lack of knowledge . <p> The relative importance of a threat type varies strongly among taxa ( table 3 ) . While habitat loss is important for all taxa , it is much less of a threat to freshwater fishes , marine fishes , and marine mammals . Overexploitation is the most prevalent threat for marine mammals and marine fishes ( affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important threat for reptiles and terrestrial mammals ( affecting 65% and 47% , respectively ) . Pollution is the second-ranked threat for freshwater fishes ( 51% ) and also threatens a similar proportion of amphibians ( 53% ) . Like Richter and colleagues ( 1997 ) , we found that nonpoint sources ( e.g. , siltation and nutrient inputs ) are the most common form of freshwater pollution . Native species interactions are the second most important threat for birds ( 46% ) , terrestrial mammals ( 47% ) , and lichens ( 57% ) . Natural causes are the second most important threat for amphibians , affecting 58% of species . Over half of Canada 's endangered amphibians are found only in the southern part of the country , within 100 kilometers of the US border ( COSEWIC 2006 ) ; Canada may represent the northern edge of these species ' range . This probably makes them especially susceptible to natural causes of endangerment , which include such factors as severe weather and inherent biological limitations . <p> The fine-scale threat categories in table 3 provide more detailed information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28% ) and agriculture ( 27% ) are the most common causes of habitat loss . Competition ( 10% ) and predation ( 6% ) are the major mechanisms by which introduced species endanger native species . Intentional harvest ( 22% ) , followed by bycatch ( 9% ) , is the most important form of overexploitation . As with the broadscale categories , these trends vary greatly among taxa . Human disturbance , typically some form of recreational activity , is the greatest cause of habitat loss for vascular plants , affecting 42% of species . Bycatch , affecting an astonishing 78% of endangered marine fish , is the most important cause of overexploitation for these taxa , whereas road kills ( 41% ) are one of the most important threats for reptiles . Threats by habitat type <p> To determine whether the prevalence of threat types varies among habitats , we grouped species by their primary habitat and compared the threats facing these groups . We attempted to define each of the 488 endangered species with threat data as being primarily a terrestrial , freshwater , or marine species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for each species from Wright and Wright ( 1957 ) , Scott and Crossman ( 1973 ) , Wheeter ( 1975 ) , Straley and colleagues ( 1985 ) , Godfrey ( 1986 ) , Argus and colleagues ( 1987 ) , Banfield ( 1987 ) , Gleason and Cronquist ( 1991 ) , Behler and King ( 1998 ) , COSEWIC ( 2006 ) , and CWS ( 2006 ) . Sixty species commonly used more than one habitat type and were therefore excluded from the analysis , including 16 birds , 13 amphibians , 9 reptiles , 5 marine mammals , 4 freshwater fishes ( anadromous ) , 5 marine fishes ( anadromous ) , 4 terrestrial mammals , and 4 vascular plants . Of the remaining 428 species , 231 were defined as terrestrial , 154 as freshwater , and 43 as marine . <p> The relative importance of the six major threat categories differs significantly among habitat types ( figure 2 ; ? = 127.42 , degree of freedom df = 10 , p < 0.001 ) . Habitat loss is the major cause of endangerment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitats , whereas overexploitation is the major cause in marine habitats ( 88% ) . The second most important threat in the terrestrial habitats is native species interactions ( 35% ) , whereas pollution is the second most common threat in freshwater habitats ( 45% ) . Habitat loss is the second most important threat ( 50% ) in oceans , primarily because vessel traffic degrades habitats for marine mammals and commercial fishing damages benthic habitats for fishes and invertebrates . Affecting only 3% of marine species , introduced species seem to be an infrequent threat in the marine environment , presumably because the long-distance dispersal that often occurs in oceans means that oceans have fewer endemic species than do terrestrial habitats ( Davis 2003 ) . <p> Figure 2 . The percentage of Canadian terrestrial ( n = 231 ) , freshwater ( n = 154 ) , and marine ( n = 43 ) endangered species that are listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as threatened by habitat loss , introduced species , overexploitation , pollution , native species interactions , or natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to link human activities , the ultimate causes of endangerment , to the proximate causes of endangerment shown in table 3 . The proximate threats of habitat loss and pollution -- habitat degradation affect 453 ( 93% ) of Canada 's endangered species . We divided the causes of these threats into five functional categories of human activity : urbanization , agriculture , human disturbance , extraction , and infrastructure . In total , there was sufficient information to determine the sources of habitat degradation for 341 species . <p> Agricultural activity ( 46% ) and urbanization ( 44% ) are the most prevalent ultimate causes of endangerment in Canada . Surprisingly , human disturbance ( 35% ) is a more common cause of habitat degradation than either extraction ( 33% ) or infrastructure development ( 28% ) . The most commonly cited forms of human disturbance were vessel traffic for marine animal species and either all-terrain vehicle use or pedestrian trampling for many terrestrial plant species . <p> Kerr and Cihlar ( 2004 ) found that land use is an excellent predictor of endangered species density in Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not on urbanization , human disturbance , extraction , or infrastructure . In our analysis , the relative importance of these nonagricultural categories of land use as a cause of endangerment is surprising . A possible explanation may be that urbanization , agriculture , human disturbance , extraction , and infrastructure development are highly associated causes of endangerment in space ( Czech et al . 2000 ) . Hence it may be difficult to conclude from remote sensing data whether it is agricultural activity alone or one of its associated threats , or both , that is actually endangering species . Comparisons with the world <p> We compared the threats facing endangered species in Canada with the threats facing globally endangered species , using data from Baille and colleagues ( 2004 ) . Summarizing data provided by IUCN , Baille and colleagues ( 2004 ) catalogued the threats facing 3829 globally endangered species of amphibians , birds , and mammals . When comparing our results with theirs , we included only these three taxa ( n = 148 ) . In their analysis , Baille and colleagues ( 2004 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our study , we combined their category " human disturbance " with " habitat loss . " We also combined " persecution " and " incidental mortality " with " overexploitation . " In our study , when a pathogen was not identified as being introduced , it was assumed to be native and included as " species interactions " To match our study , we combined Baille and colleagues ' ( 2004 ) " disease " and " changes in native species dynamics " to form " species interactions . " Finally , we retained only " natural disasters " from our original category " natural causes . " <p> The prevalence of threat types differs significantly between Canadian and globally endangered species ( figure 3 ; ? = 38.42 , df = 5 , p < 0.001 ) . While habitat loss is the most prevalent threat both in Canada ( 79% ) and globally ( 87% ) , it affects a slightly greater proportion of globally endangered species ( ? = 7.865 , df = 1 , p = 0.005 ) . Introduced species affect a similarly small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16% ; ? = 0.47 , df = 1 , p = 0.49 ) . Overexploitation threatens significantly more endangered species in Canada than globally ( 46% and 23% , respectively ; ? = 43.68 , df = 1 , p < 0.001 ) . The differential importance of overexploitation in the two studies can largely be explained by the relative importance of the three taxa in the two studies . Baille and colleagues ' ( 2004 ) study included proportionately more amphibians and fewer mammals than did our study . If we adjust our taxa to the same relative frequency as those in Baille and colleagues ' ( 2004 ) study , there is no significant difference in the importance of overexploitation to Canadian ( 26% ) and globally ( 24% ) endangered species ( ? = 0.815 , df = 1 , p = 0.367 ) . Natural disasters affect significantly more endangered species in Canada than globally ( 16% and 9% , respectively ; ? = 8.86 , df = 1 , p = 0.003 ) , perhaps because many of Canada 's endangered species exist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 , Warman et al . 2004 ) and are therefore more susceptible to severe weather events . <p> Figure 3 . The percentage of endangered species in Canada ( n = 148 ) and worldwide ( n = 3829 ) that are affected by habitat loss , introduced species , overexploitation , pollution , native species interactions , and natural disasters . Comparisons with the United States <p> We compared the threats facing endangered species in Canada with those in the United States , using data from Wilcove and colleagues ( 1998 ) . In their study , Wilcove and colleagues cataloged the threats facing 1880 imperiled species , subspecies , and populations of vertebrates , invertebrates , and plants . However , their categories of threat differed from ours ; they did not include native species interactions and natural causes as potential threats , but instead included disease , which was found to affect only 3% of species . To permit direct comparison between the two studies , these categories were excluded . <p> Habitat loss and introduced species are the leading threats to imperiled species in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( figure 4 ) . While habitat loss is equally important in both countries ( ? = 0.42 , df = 1 , p = 0.52 ) , the importance of introduced species as a cause of endangerment in the United States contrasts strongly with our results , which identify introduced species as the least common broadscale threat in Canada ( ? = 113.74 , df = 1 , p < 0.001 ) . We believe the heightened importance of introduced species in the United States can be explained by the large number of Hawaiian species included in Wilcove and colleagues ' ( 1998 ) analysis and the widespread effects of introduced species on the islands . For instance , the authors included 456 Hawaiian plants and birds , of which 99% were threatened by introduced species . Excluding Hawaiian species , the importance of introduced species did not differ significantly between the United States ( 31% ) and Canada ( 27% ) for plants and birds , the only taxa for which data are available ( ? = 1.22 , df = 1 , p = 0.27 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 488 ) and US ( n = 1880 ) endangered species that are affected by habitat loss , introduced species , overexploitation , and pollution . <p> Aside from disease , Wilcove and colleagues ( 1998 ) found overexploitation to be the least important threat in the United States , affecting only 17% of imperiled species ( figure 4 ) . This contrasts strongly with Canada , where we found 32% of species to be threatened by overexploitation ( ? = 51.13 , df = 1 , p < 0.001 ) . While this discrepancy may be due in part to real differences between the two countries , we believe it is largely attributable to the definition of overexploitation . Wilcove and colleagues ( 1998 ) included only overharvest , to the exclusion of bycatch , persecution , and accidental mortality . Redefining our category for consistency with theirs , we find that overharvest threatens only a slightly higher proportion of endangered species in Canada than in the United States ( 22% and 17% , respectively ; ? = 6.83 , df = 1 , p = 0.009 ) . Conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilcove et al . 1998 , Baille et al . 2004 ) , showed that habitat loss is the greatest threat to endangered species in Canada . Affecting 94% of terrestrial species , habitat loss is caused primarily by agricultural and urban land conversion . The establishment of terrestrial protected areas is a common and effective response to protect species from habitat loss ( Balmford et al . 1995 ) . Unfortunately , much of the habitat used by Canada 's endangered species exists on private land ( Barla et al . 2000 ) . To protect these species , landowners will need to be compensated for encouraging the persistence of endangered species on their property ( Polasky et al . 1997 ) , which is explicitly recognized in Canada 's new endangered species legislation ( SARA 2006 ) . On the negative side , SARA provides less habitat protection for terrestrial species than the United States ' Endangered Species Act ; in Canada , critical habitat for endangered species is strictly protected only on federal lands , accounting for only 4% of the terrestrial habitat south of 60 north latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all migratory birds and aquatic species receive habitat protection under SARA . In addition , a " safety net " process can provide habitat protection for species not on federal lands . <p> We found that overexploitation was the second most common threat in Canada , in contrast with other researchers ' findings for the United States and for the world . Moreover , overexploitation was the most important threat facing Canadian marine species . To protect these species , there is a strong initiative to establish a system of marine protected areas , both in Canada and globally ( Balmford et al . 2004 ) . Unfortunately , most analyses suggest that 20% to 30% of oceans need to be protected to sustain world fisheries in the remaining habitat ( Balmford et al . 2004 ) . This is an ambitious goal , given that only 0.5% of oceans are currently protected , compared with 11.5% of terrestrial habitats ( Meir et al . 2004 ) . <p> Introduced species are the least important threat in Canada . This contrasts strongly with the findings of previous studies ( Wilcove et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with popular opinion ( Wilson 1992 ) . However , when Hawaiian species are excluded , introduced species are about equally important in the United States and Canada . Furthermore , introduced species are rarely a threat to Chinese ( 3% ; Yiming and Wilcove 2005 ) or globally threatened species ( 16% ; Baille et al . 2004 ) . It appears that introduced species may be a less important threat , at least on continents , than previously thought . <p> Natural disasters and natural causes emerge as more common threats in Canada than globally . This surprising result does not mean that natural processes alone are major threats to Canada 's biodiversity . Of the 237 species for which either natural disasters or natural causes are listed as threats , only 15 species are threatened by no other cause . On average , these 237 species are threatened by 1.6 other broadscale threats and 2.5 other fine-scale threats . <p> Many endangered species in southern Canada have stable core populations in the United States ( Bunnell et al . 2004 , Warman et al . 2004 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what efforts , if any , should be made to protect these endangered peripheral populations . Peripheral populations are thought to be more susceptible to extinction and therefore harder to conserve ( Hoffman and Blows 1994 ) . However , recent studies have shown that under conditions of range contraction , core populations appear to suffer extirpation first , leaving only peripheral populations ( Channell and Lomolino 2000 , Laliberte and Ripple 2004 ) . Determining the value of peripheral populations will prove critical for conservation policy in Canada . <p> In general , our findings present few major surprises . There are important differences in the causes of endangerment in Canada among major habitats and taxa , but many of the marked differences among regions of the world are more apparent than real . Finally , most species are affected by more than one threat , with the number of threats increasing with the level of endangerment . Effective conservation strategies must be able to address multiple threats simultaneously .

##4000951 ( Contributions from " Soledad Cross History " published at www.aclusandiego.org made with permission of the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties. ) 1954-1990 <p> The annual Thomas Guide published by Thomas Brothers Maps refers to the landmark as the " Mount Soledad Easter Cross . " Easter Sunday 1954 <p> With the permission of the San Diego City Council , the Mount Soledad Memorial Association ( MSMA ) dedicates the cross on Mount Soledad as a tribute to veterans of World War I , World War II , and the Korean Conflict . 1989 <p> On May 31 Philip Paulson and Howard Kreisner file a lawsuit claiming the religious symbol 's presence on state land violates provisions of the U.S. and California constitutions . They do all of their legal research and writing as well as court presentations without legal representation . <p> A small plaque dated November 11 that recognizes the site as a memorial to veterans is mounted to the fence surrounding the base of the cross . 1991 <p> On December 3 U.S. District Court Judge Gordon Thompson Jr . rules in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross is permanently positioned inside a public park and maintained at taxpayers ' expense . Kreisner resigns from the case shortly after the ruling and the City of San Diego Historical Site Board designates the cross and the surrounding park as historical sites . 1992 <p> On June 2 San Diego voters approve Proposition F , which allows transfer of ownership of a portion of Mount Soledad Natural Park to a private , non-profit corporation for maintenance of a historic war memorial . 1993 <p> The city appeals the 1991 district court decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which upholds the decision , ruling that the mere designation of the cross as a war memorial is n't enough to satisfy the " no preference clause " of the California Constitution . The City and County of San Diego thereupon petition and are granted a hearing en banc ( a vote by the entire twenty-eight judges of the court ) . They lose by a unanimous decision . 1994 <p> The city sells 224 square feet of land at the base of the cross to the Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states its intention to keep the cross as part of its proposed war memorial and the city does n't solicit or consider bids from any other prospective buyers of the land . <p> On October 10 the City and County of San Diego petition the U.S. Supreme Court with a writ of certiorari . The Court declines to hear the appeal . 1996 <p> Though it has become a tradition for Christian groups to hold Easter sunrise services at the cross site , this year University of California at San Diego Political Science Professor Peter Irons is the first to secure the permit for that date and proceeds to conduct a controversial but well-attended secular sunrise event for people of all religions and no religion . 1997 <p> On September 18 Judge Thompson rules that both the negotiated sale of the cross site to the MSMA and the size of the plot sold violate two separate provisions of the California Constitution . Thompson writes : " Both the method of sale and the amount of land sold underneath the Mount Soledad cross do not cure the constitutional infirmities outlined in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again attempts to sell the land to a private group . Five bids are submitted , including one from the Freedom From Religion Foundation . The bid from the MSMA ( the highest ) is accepted and a half-acre of land around the cross is sold for $106,000 . <p> Paulson receives the " Freedom Fighter Award " from the Rationalist Society of St. Louis . 2000 <p> On February 3 Judge Thompson upholds the 1998 transfer . Paulson appeals , and the ACLU joins the appeal as his co-counsel . <p> The MSMA constructs six concentric granite walls around the base of the cross designed to hold plaques purchased by individuals wishing to honor a veteran 's military service . An American flag , small pillars , and brick pavers are also installed to honor community and veterans ' groups and supporters of the memorial . All told , the MSMA will spend over $900,000 on the improvements and sell over 1300 plaques. 2001 <p> In August a three-judge panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirms Judge Thompson 's ruling . 2002 <p> Paulson 's petition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case is reargued on March 21 before an eleven-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit . <p> On June 26 the court finds that the city 's sale of the cross to the MSMA violates Article XVI , section 5 , of the California Constitution , which prohibits government from affording any financial advantage or subsidy to religion . <p> The city again appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court , which again declines to hear the case . 2004 <p> The La Jolla American Legion Post 275 , which created the MSMA , votes unanimously to support moving the cross to the nearby Mount Soledad Presbyterian Church . The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce lobbies the city council to support the move . In exchange for Paulson dismissing his suit , the parties agree to move the cross to the church , allowing the MSMA to maintain an interest in the war memorial and replace the cross with a nonsectarian symbol appropriately recognizing all veterans . <p> The settlement terms are presented to the city council on July 27 but the council conditions its acceptance on the outcome of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters . Proposition K specifically asks voters to give the city authorization to sell a portion of Mount Soledad to the highest bidder . <p> On November 2 voters reject Proposition K by a large margin . <p> Two members of Congress , Randy Cunningham and Duncan Hunter , slip a rider into a $300 billion appropriations bill to designate the memorial a national monument , specifically requiring the continued presence of the cross . This allows the federal government to accept a yet-to-be-offered donation of the land from the city and directs the National Park Service to help maintain it . A restraining order temporarily bars the transfer to the federal government . <p> On December 19 Paulson is named 2004 Atheist of the Year by American Atheists California . 2005 <p> On March 8 the San Diego City Council votes against a proposal to transfer the land to the National Park Service . <p> A petition signed by over 100,000 San Diego County residents causes the City Council to reconsider its decision to transfer the land . On May 16 , after rejecting in a 5-4 vote a proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council votes 6-3 to include a ballot measure in the forthcoming special Mayoral election . <p> Paulson files a pre-election challenge in state court , claiming the proposed transfer violates the California Constitution . <p> On July 26 voters approve Proposition A to transfer the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial property to the federal government . <p> On September 3 , in response to Paulson 's challenge , Superior Court Judge Patricia Yin Cowett issues a temporary restraining order barring the transfer . Lawyers on each side present their arguments on October 3 . A key issue is the status of the area as a secular war memorial , given that it was n't developed as a memorial until ten years after the first lawsuit . <p> An October 1 New York Times article reports that , because San Diego City Attorney Michael Aguirre personally opposes fighting to keep the cross , he brought in a lawyer from a conservative Christian legal advocacy group to make the city 's case . " It 's clearly unconstitutional , " he declares , adding that the case has gone on for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulings . " It 's like San Diego does n't recognize the need to comply with the law as a fundamental principle . " <p> On October 7 Judge Cowett finds the ballot measure unconstitutional . Her ruling states : " Maintenance of this Latin Cross as it is on the property in question , is found to be an unconstitutional preference of religion in violation of Article I , Section 4 , of the California Constitution , and the transfer of the memorial with the cross as its centerpiece to the federal government to save the cross as it is , where it is , is an unconstitutional aid to religion in violation of Article XVI , Section 5 . " <p> In December Philip Paulson 's lawyer James McElroy asks a San Diego Superior Court judge to order the city of San Diego to pay his legal fees for the October victory . 2006 <p> On January 13 Judge Cowett rules that the city must pay for McElroy 's fees , but exactly how much is yet to be determined . The city plans to appeal . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Soledad cross must be removed from the property within ninety days or the city of San Diego will be fined $5,000 a day thereafter . <p> In a May 4 article in the San Diego Union-Tribune , William Kellogg , president of the MSMA is quoted as saying the group is prepared to have the cross moved to private property nearby and place another fitting symbol for veterans at the memorial . " We feel it 's very important that the cross be saved , " he says . " The location of the cross is not the primary issue . " In the same article , Paulson 's attorney James McElroy says , " It 's time to end seventeen years of litigation and it 's time for the taxpayers to end footing the bill for futile litigation . " He also reports receiving numerous death threats , one as recently as the day before , as a result of handling the case . <p> On May 11 Mayor Jerry Sanders asks President George W. Bush to use the power of eminent domain to take the city-owned property on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 23 the San Diego City Council votes 5-3 to appeal Judge Thompson 's May 3rd order to remove the cross . <p> Mayor Sanders announces on June 2 that the city has filed an appeal of Thomson 's order . The city also asks that the appeal be ruled on by June 8 , after which they will comply with the order if the appeal is n't granted . <p> On June 21 a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declines to step in and suspend the $5,000 daily fine that will be imposed on the city if the cross is n't removed by August 1 . <p> On June 26 San Diego County Congressmen Duncan Hunter ( R-52nd ) , Brian Bilbray ( R-50th ) and Darrell Issa ( R-49th ) introduce HR 5683 , a bill to preserve the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in San Diego , California , by providing for the immediate acquisition of the memorial by the United States . <p> On July 3 Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.

Plaintiff Paulson seeks a court-ordered injunction and stay by stopping the transfer until all legal issues have been adjudicated in the courts . <p> On August 11 Paulson and newly named Plaintiff Steve Trunk file a new lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Southern California . U.S. District Court Judge Barry Moskowitz agrees to rule and decide by September 2006 if both the land transfer and the presence of the cross on federal land are unconstitutional . <p> On August 14 President Bush signs HR 5683 . <p> On August 21 the ACLU , representing the Jewish War Veterans of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , charging that the continued display of the Mount Soledad cross on federally owned land unlawfully entangles government with religion . The suit asks the Court to order the cross ' removal . <p> In a September 1 story , the San-Diego Union-Tribune reports that Paulson was diagnosed on July 31 with terminal liver cancer .

The ACLU has lost all moorings and common sense and rationality and proportionality .. It 's become the Taliban of American liberal secularism .

##4000952 IN THE MONTHS AFTER the 2004 election , when the red states were said to have voted on the basis of their " moral values " many observers noted that the sleazy television shows and movies so energetically denounced by the traditionalist and Christian right tended to get their highest ratings in the same parts of the country most populated by such people . ( They noted , as well , that some of the family pathologies that traditionalists decry are found at high rates among these most vocal proponents of " family values . " ) <p> Some took this as a clear indication of the hypocrisy of conservatives : what they denounce , they also secretly enjoy . They are n't as concerned about morality , this critique declared , as they pretend to be ; while they maintain a posture of devotion to righteousness they 're indulging their forbidden impulses in hidden ways . <p> Jimmy Swaggart writ large . <p> But I do n't think " hypocrisy " is the most illuminating way of seeing this phenomenon . Not if hypocrisy is understood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from looking at the matter of " moral structure . " <p> From my discussions of morality with religious traditionalists , I 've gleaned that many of them assume that people who do n't believe in their firm and strict moral structures -- people who do n't believe in God , the Ten Commandments , or inviolable and absolute rules of moral conduct -- must be living lives of sin and debauchery . They ca n't understand ( and often seem unwilling even to believe ) that people like Humanists might be living the kind of well-ordered lives , as hard-working and law-abiding citizens responsible and dedicated to their families , that they themselves strive to live . <p> Their failure to understand how nonbelieving " liberals " can live moral lives is actually the reverse side of the same coin from the liberals ' imputation of hypocrisy to those red-staters who watch Desperate Housewives and may also have disordered family lives . <p> These misunderstandings stem from the failure of the two groups to recognize their differing moral structures . DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCUS OF CONTROL <p> A student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's Moral Crisis " came up with the most apt image . It did n't matter much to her whether her society has a lot of enforced rules . She 's got her moral beliefs firmly inside her -- a kind of endo-skeleton , she called it . <p> We had been talking about the distress American traditionalists have felt at the erosion of a social consensus about the straight-and-narrow path . For them , she said , morality seemed to be a kind of exo-skeleton . This was her image to capture their reliance on external moral structures -- laws , punishments , and so forth -- to keep them within the moral confines in which they believe . <p> In that perspective , the assumed anomalies or hypocrisies of certain traditionalists make greater sense . <p> It becomes clear why such people -- possessing intense moral concerns combined with a reliance upon external moral structures to keep their own forbidden impulses in check -- would support a state that enforces moral rules and a social culture that stigmatizes those who violate those rules . It really is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them fails to be clear in its rules and strict in its enforcement . <p> For one whose moral structure is cast in that exo-skeleton form , the absence of external moral authority seems necessarily to imply the outbreak of moral anarchy . That 's the logic implied by the famous line falsely attributed to Fyodor Dostoevski : " If God does not exist , everything is permitted . " It 's what lies behind the fear that if gays are allowed to marry , marriage generally would somehow be threatened , including the sanctity of one 's own . <p> To the liberal with the endoskeleton structure , both of those seem like logical non sequiturs . And , logically , perhaps they are . But they bespeak a psychological reality . If the outside structure breaks down , who knows what one might do ? <p> Liberals have often failed to understand how the loosening of society 's moral standards , rules , and sanctions can be genuinely threatening to the moral order of those with the exo-skeleton structure . They have n't appreciated the plight of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in doing it . <p> Likewise , many liberals have responded with anger , unleavened by understanding , to the tendency of some traditionalists to try to impose their moral views on others . It is their dependence on the strength and integrity of the external moral order that drives many " exo-skeletons " to crusade to make the whole world around them conform to the moral system to which they themselves are striving to adhere . The unspoken and generally unacknowledged need is : please , society , be morally strict enough to keep me on the straight-and-narrow path . INTEGRITY AND HYPOCRISY : THE CHALLENGE TO THE EXO-SKELETONS <p> These fears of traditionalists reflect a lack of integration -- the morality not fully integrated into the psyche . <p> St. Paul lamented : " For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do . " Truly , he wanted to do the good . But it is not entirely true that the evil he did was something he wanted not . For a part of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> So was Paul a hypocrite for doing what he declared himself to be against ? And are the red-staters hypocrites if they indulge -- perhaps more even than the liberals -- the forbidden desires ? <p> Well , yes and no . Yes , in that they are n't practicing what they preach . And that does represent a lack of integrity . But the " dishonesty " involved is not about lying to others so much as it is a natural outgrowth of the identification with only a part of the self , the moral part , with a concomitant sense that the other part , with the forbidden desire , is the not-I . <p> So that is the hypocritical part : the failure to embrace the whole truth about the self -- that is comprised not only of the " righteous " part but of the " sinner " part as well . <p> If the moral order of the surrounding society weakens , the person with a moral exo-skeleton is genuinely threatened -- not just regarding his conduct , but also even regarding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those of us with the endo-skeleton structure -- who can live moral and orderly lives even if we live in an " anything goes " society -- can reasonably be tempted to feel superior to those with the exo-skeleton dependency on the moral sanctions of a more straight-and-narrow society . <p> And indeed there are theories of moral development according to which the internalization of moral order is a more " advanced " form of moral development . <p> But , at this point in our nation 's history , we can see that the quest for advanced consciousness has many dimensions , and neither side of America 's divide has aced the course . This is part of the cost of our cultural polarization -- two forms of moral blindness , very different from each other but also two sides of the same coin . <p> Just as the cultural right has damaged the United States because of its failure to acknowledge its inner sinner , the left has damaged the nation through its failure to recognize its inner moral structure . <p> This was one of the greatest shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply tore down a great many of our society 's moral structures and assumed that all would be well . We had half-baked theories of human nature , and of society , that justified " letting it all hang out " and " doing our own thing " and " if it feels good , do it . " <p> History has shown that we were naive . Not all has been well . Indeed , I would argue that this naive miscalculation is part of what has led , ultimately , to the rise of the more destructive forces from the right , embodied by the administration of George W. Bush . LIVING OFF OF OUR MORAL CAPITAL <p> What many in the counterculture did , I believe , was to look at themselves in their " liberated " state and imagine that they saw human nature in its pristine condition . But in reality , most of the middle class youth -- brought up in the 1940s and ' 50s -- who comprised the counterculture had already internalized a great many of the disciplines , moral and otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could engage in the cultural revolution of liberation and then go on to become effective , middle class , liberal professionals with well-ordered lives . <p> The loosening of the moral structures of society has impacted , rather , the heirs of the counterculture -- younger people who did n't form their characters in the tighter environments of the 1940s and ' 50s but in the culturally looser decades since . <p> Veteran teachers have long complained that each successive wave of students shows signs of a loosening in discipline of various kinds . The culture has grown trashier , the demands of society have become less stringent , the culture of indulgence has grown deeper -- and all this has led to a visible cultural decline . <p> Of course many of those who carried with them the older structures have managed to raise children whose lives are also fairly well ordered . But even there it is a diminishing cultural capital that we are living off of . And I expect that among the endo-skeletons -- in the absence of some kind of cultural renewal -- the necessary forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attenuate . <p> But it is on the other side of the cultural divide -- in the realm of the exo-skeletons -- that the loosening of the moral order has proved most dangerous . <p> It is n't only that the cultural right , more dependent on the external restraints , becomes more likely to succumb to forbidden impulses -- like sailors come to port . More dangerous for society is that the particular nature of the right 's moral vision -- its relative harshness and its punitiveness -- transforms the impulses of the human animal into something darker . <p> Fragile orders tend also to be harsher -- tyranny being seen as the surest means to avoid anarchy . And , accordingly , a moral order that is less internalized , being more fragile , tends also toward harshness . <p> Thus the morality of the exo-skeletons tends to denigrate the human nature it seeks to control . This morality also tends to be more punitive in its approach to control -- glad to invest big sums in a brutal prison system ( whether or not such punishments actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoning the torture of enemy combatants , passionately committed to the death penalty , and building its worldview around a highly punitive Lord of the Universe . <p> And the harsher the morality -- the more the interaction between cultural demand and human nature is conducted in the form of war -- the more the feelings inside the human being turn toward rage ( at the wounds inflicted ) , toward a desire for power ( to counteract the powerlessness of being small in a world that has declared war on you ) , and toward a lust for vengeance ( for all the punishment and rejection inflicted ) . <p> The harsh morality of the cultural right thus engenders within the human spirit a kind of wolf . It is a wolf such as Shakespeare described in Troilus and Cressida : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> And the same harsh morality that goads this wolf into life will also -- when it is intact -- help confine that beast to its cage . <p> The loosening of the cage of the nation 's social morality had one meaning , therefore , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exoskeletons . It is as though a boat was tipped by the left , but it was the right that got wet . <p> It was n't just the natural id that was loosed on the cultural right , but also unleashed were those impulses that their subcultures harshness had made dark . We in the counterculture who wanted to liberate , for example , the natural sexual energies of the human creature also , unwittingly , weakened the checks on the lust for power , on greed , on self-aggrandizement . <p> Morality , it turns out , is of a piece . And so is our culture . <p> And so it could be said the wolf has now broken from its cage . Draped in the national flag , it prowls society from the precincts of power , fooling enough people into thinking that what it 's bringing is order . RECONSTRUCTING THE CAGE <p> In any event , there are better options for order . But their realization is a significant cultural achievement . Good order in the human realm does n't happen except through wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twofold . It is n't only to remove that wolf from power but it is also to help reconstruct the cage -- those structures of morality that kept it in check . Ideally , we 'd do much better than merely " reconstruct " the moral cage of an earlier era . That would be an improvement over this loosening , which has unleashed these dark forces . But still better would be to find a better means of containment , or perhaps even a more harmonious form of domestication that does n't need to abuse the creature it brings into the social fold . That old order was far from ideal . <p> The counterculture recognized the oppressiveness of the old order but it failed to realize that a truly beneficent revolution is n't accomplished by the storming of the Bastille . And it failed to recognize that the movement of a culture to its next , more advanced form is a long-term and difficult process . <p> What is needed this time around is n't a wanton rejection of the old structures , replacing them with nothing . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us together . <p> We must understand , that is , that the moral endo-skeleton is not nothing . It is something achieved through human development . And , more , we need to understand that the endo-skeleton does n't come from nothing . It is the internalization of the order the growing human encounters around him or her . <p> And no skeleton at all is a recipe for falling apart . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Andrew Bard Schmookler <p> <p> Andrew Bard Schmookler is the creator of the website www.NoneSoBlind.org .

##4000953 DR . JOSEPH L. " JOEL " ANDREWS spent two weeks in the New Orleans area in December 2005 as a physician volunteer for the American Red Cross Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief Programs . Three months after the hurricane had hit , he witnessed firsthand the storm 's devastating effects on residents in the city 's various communities . <p> MY FIRST NEW ORLEANS HOUSE CALL is one I will certainly never forget . I was working in the Red Cross office in Metairie when I received an urgent request to help evaluate a very agitated man in Mid City . I left the office immediately and drove south on Interstate 10 to North Carrollton Street . <p> I met Arlo , a retired psychologist and Red Cross volunteer mental health worker from California , in the parking lot of an abandoned Burger King . Arlo had visited a client , Floyd S. , the previous day at the request of a Red Cross emergency crew . Floyd had told the crew that he would die if he did n't receive his medications soon . Arlo had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schizophrenia , manic-depressive disorder , and hypertension , along with other medical conditions . <p> I followed Arlo down a side street . The wooden houses on this block had received major hits , both from Hurricane Katrina 's high winds and from the storm 's floodwaters . Most sported bright blue FEMA tarps , designed to stop water from leaking through roofs whose shingles had been torn off by Katrina 's strong winds . Tall debris piles littered sidewalks on both sides of the street , blocking some access points . Cars were coated with dried flood muck . <p> Arlo and I entered the shotgun-style house where Floyd was staying . Although the building was elevated about four feet off the ground , the flood surge had done its dirty business . The house smelled dank from muck and mold . Filthy clothes and furniture were strewn haphazardly in the front room . Horizontal brown lines on the walls about four feet above the floor were evidence of the levels that earlier flooding had reached . Clearly , no one had done any cleanup here in the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bed in the back room of the house . We asked him to come out to the front room , which he did reluctantly . I asked him to sit and settled down across from him on a filthy rocking chair . Then I tried to take a medical history . Floyd told me that he was fifty-three , but his unkempt gray dreadlocks , lined face , jumbled speech , and unruly white beard gave him the appearance of a man twenty years older . <p> I ascertained that Floyd had n't taken his psychiatric or blood pressure medicines in more than three weeks , since he was unable to get his prescriptions filled . The more we talked the more manic and incoherent Floyd became . Then he stood up and ran out the door . <p> Arlo and I went outside and saw Floyd talking to three men on the front porch of a house a few doors down . We approached the men , who told us that Floyd became increasingly agitated when he could n't take his meds . Neither his wife nor his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he often came to them . The men sometimes brought food to him , and Earl , a tall man in yellow Lakers sweatpants , said that he had occasionally paid for Floyd 's medications in the past . Agreeing that he needed immediate hospitalization to get him back on his medications , Arlo and I took Floyd back to his own home . <p> Standing in the street , I used my cellphone to call East Jefferson Hospital ( in suburban Metairie ) to talk to the emergency room doctor who had written Floyd 's prescriptions three weeks earlier . He was n't there , so I called the hospital 's record room in an effort to learn more about Floyd 's diagnoses and treatments . The clerk there told me she could n't release any information unless I faxed her a release signed by the client . I told her I did n't have access to a fax machine and there was no way I could get this man to sign a release in his current condition . The clerk hung up . <p> I then called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could provide transportation to the hospital . Five minutes later a squad car pulled up , then another , and then another , until finally a squadron of six police cars blocked the street . A posse of twelve New Orleans police officers emerged from their cars and walked toward us . They chatted amiably to each other , like attendees at a law enforcement convention . When they asked if Floyd was armed , we said we did n't think so . A stocky officer frisked him , then snapped handcuffs around his wrists . Understandably , Floyd 's demeanor worsened as he sat forlornly on the front steps . <p> I asked a police officer , " Why all the cops and the cuffs ? " <p> " For a show of force , " she replied . " The cuffs are because recently an officer got shot in a similar situation . " Six squad cars then departed . One hauled away a handcuffed and now severely distraught Floyd . <p> Two days later I returned to Floyd 's neighborhood with Tim , another mental health worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks and whites , clustered on the street in front of his house . One man in preppy attire , definitely out of place in this neighborhood , identified himself as a mystery writer . He said he 'd come to reclaim a book that he had previously lent to Floyd . The writer sported a pair of hiking boots hanging by their laces around his neck . He 'd brought them for Floyd , he said , who was currently shoeless . <p> Floyd 's neighbors told us that the police had taken him to Ochsner Foundation Hospital in Jefferson . They brought him back at three o'clock in the morning with more paper prescriptions but without any actual drugs . <p> We found Floyd on the steps of a ramshackle religious shelter several blocks away . As I climbed the steps , Floyd smiled , greeted me by name , and started singing " Somewhere Over the Rainbow . " Why that ? I thought . Then I remembered . The first time I met Floyd I had introduced myself as " Dr. Andrews . You know , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and told him that it was really Judy Garland who sang The Wizard of Oz song ; that Julie Andrews had starred in The Sound of Music . Floyd just kept singing " Over the Rainbow " anyway . He looked pleased with himself . I too was pleased that he was in a better mood and " with it " enough to smile and reach out to make some social connection . <p> During my two weeks making home visits in New Orleans I saw firsthand Katrina 's effect on people . I also saw the storm 's effect on infrastructure , especially in the most heavily damaged Lower Ninth Ward , where powerful waves from the breached levees had pulverized wooden houses and left only splintered timbers . <p> I visited sections of New Orleans with moderate house damage , such as Mid City and Lakeview and the suburbs of Metairie , Kenner , and Westwego . Many of these neighborhoods still had no electric or water services . When I visited these houses with Molly , a Red Cross caseworker , I discovered that most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been depleted by months of living as evacuees . After returning to New Orleans these homeowners dipped further into savings to rehabilitate their gutted homes , often at the mercy of scarce and expensive contractors . <p> The evening after Floyd sang to me on the porch , I attended a panel discussion by the Health/Social Services Committee , part of Mayor Ray Nagin 's Bring Back New Orleans Commission . The news was n't good : thirteen of seventeen public health clinics were destroyed by Katrina , only two of New Orleans ' eleven hospitals were then open , and most doctors offices were still closed . Most patient records were destroyed or lost . Most evacuees had moved elsewhere without their medications , prescriptions , or records . And about 50 percent of evacuees had no health insurance . The New Orleans healthcare system , always shaky , now lay shattered in Katrina 's wake . There were no medicines for Floyd and thousands of other residents of New Orleans because these residents had close to nothing -- no money , no insurance , no telephone , no transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher lauded the residents of New Orleans for their " resiliency and commitment . " He noted , however , that the trauma and violence many children endured during Katrina made it likely that they , as well as many adults , would experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder , increasing their tendency toward violent behavior as they grew older . <p> Next , the chairs of six subcommittees ( Primary Care , Specialty Care , Hospitals , Public Health , Environmental Health , and Social Services ) presented their proposals for improving health in New Orleans . They noted sadly that Louisiana had placed forty-ninth out of fifty states in measures of the quality of healthcare before Katrina . Their wish lists that night included measures that did n't exist before the storm , such as improved cooperation and coordination between hospitals , universal access to all health facilities , and better evacuation plans to prevent a similar catastrophe . <p> I noted two important shortcomings with the hundred or so proposals on these planners ' wish lists : no mention was made about how all these desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a timetable for when they would actually take place . <p> Several days later I made my way down unlit corridors leading to a warren of small rooms in a building on Burgundy Street , not far from the French Quarter . I was making a house call on Clara D. , an eighty-seven-year-old lady living alone with her black dog , Girlie . A former shrimp factory worker , Clara had been evacuated to nearby Kenner after Katrina ; she had returned to her cluttered two rooms only a short time before we met . <p> In addition to multiple health problems , Clara was most worried about her lack of finances . She received $579 a month from Social Security and $75 in food stamps , which she said would soon decrease . Her rent was $400 a month . Little was left to pay for medical care and drugs . And , like most elderly shut-ins in the Big Easy , Clara had no phone , no transportation , no doctor or clinic , and no accessible pharmacy . <p> I spent more than thirty minutes on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no avail . Each published resource number I called accessed only a recorded message , which merely listed many more numbers to call . No actual services were provided . I felt like shouting , " We need services , not numbers ! And we need them now ! " <p> Despite the optimistic dreams of its healthcare planners , New Orleans still has a long way to go to create an effective medical care infrastructure to provide equitable delivery of high-quality healthcare for all . Only one half of pre-Katrina hospital beds are usable . Six of nine hospitals remain shuttered . Of the ninety healthcare clinics that existed pre-Katrina ( where most of the poor got their care ) less than twenty are functioning now . Nursing home beds are scarce . <p> Much has been said and written to explain the catastrophe that was New Orleans before , during , and after Katrina : inadequacy of the levees , lack of evacuation planning and execution , slowness of government agencies such as FEMA to respond to the emergency , and so on . <p> What can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans ? <p> As previously stated , Louisiana was ranked forty-ninth out of fifty states in healthcare outcomes before Katrina . Post-Katrina plans abound to improve its healthcare system , but the essential ingredients -- adequate funding , careful planning , and coordination -- are still questionable . Clinics , private practices , hospitals , pharmacies , and patient transportation all still need strengthening over a year later . <p> The fact that many poor New Orleanians , mostly blacks , remained for days or weeks in a severely flooded city because there were no means to evacuate them came as a surprise to many Americans . The fact that many elderly , frail people were left behind to die unnecessarily was a cause for shame throughout the United States . Can widespread poverty be addressed successfully in a city that has lost half its population and many more jobs ? It will require the political will , careful and coordinated planning , much work , and much money to remedy . <p> Perhaps city officials and healthcare planners should figure out how to more effectively harness the underappreciated strengths demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ill . The compassion and care , demonstrated so admirably by Floyd 's neighbors every day , might well help to address the significant challenges the city now faces in bolstering healthcare . <p> Finally , will important lessons be learned in time ? If another powerful hurricane occurs , will the New Orleans healthcare system be strong enough to withstand the new strains placed on an already overburdened system ? This issue must be faced here and now , not somewhere over the rainbow . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Joseph L. Andrews , M.D. <p> <p> Dr. Joseph L.

##4000957 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPER place of religion in a democracy and the separation of church and state remain in the news . In the United States , legal and social battles about the proper place to draw the line between religion and government are being waged around the issues of abortion , gay marriage , faith-based social services , and other well-publicized flash points of conflict between sacred beliefs and secular authority . And with the political influence of religious conservatives evidenced in the 2004 presidential election , the issue of religious influence on affairs of state is likely to remain a matter of importance and controversy for the foreseeable future . Thus the secularism and church-state separation of liberal democratic theory are under renewed attack . So reexamining the principles underlying secular government becomes not simply a matter of leisurely philosophical speculation but one of extreme political and practical urgency . <p> The principle of separation of church and state is essential for providing for and preserving both religious freedom and the long-term continuation of the peaceful stability of a well-ordered , liberal democracy -- where human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and where more human freedom is recognized as better than less . But leaders of what is commonly called the religious right have been attempting to tear down the Jeffersonian wall of separation between church and state ( as did many religionists in Thomas Jefferson 's own day ) . So it is necessary to clarify what is at stake in this struggle . <p> Many people do n't realize that the phrase " separation of church and state " is n't found anywhere in the Constitution of the United States . The celebrated First Amendment simply places a prohibition on Congress by saying that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . " This language severely limits the actions of the federal government but says nothing about limitations on state governments or on religion itself . On the contrary , for many alive at the time of ratification , one intention of the restraint on Congress appears to have been to give state governments free rein in religious matters . It was n't until 1868 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that states were constitutionally required to be religiously neutral . <p> While various Supreme Court decisions have since used the language and imagery of the " wall of separation between church and state , " the phrase originated in the famous letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to the Danbury , Connecticut , Baptist Association during his first term as president in 1802 . In this letter he also wrote that " religion is a matter which lies solely between man &; his god . " This was a principled position : later in his Autobiography he made it clear that his thinking included " the Jew and the Gentile , the Christian and the Mahometan , the Hindoo , and infidel of every denomination . " Jefferson had the genius to recognize that the fundamental issue of religious freedom extends beyond the simple mutual toleration of different Christian denominations for each other . <p> Before examining the importance of the separation of church and state in liberal democratic theory , it is necessary to clarify two important presuppositions of that theory . The first is a certain view of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ) is the distinction between the private lives of citizens and the public arena in which legislation or public policy is proposed , debated , and then either approved or defeated . <p> Liberal democratic theory is committed to a general philosophic view of human nature that can be traced to the Enlightenment . Are human equality and human freedom intrinsic goods ? Is it the role of government to protect and nurture these goods ? Does the ultimate source of legitimate political authority lie in the citizens of a republic ? Liberal democratic theory answers in the affirmative and views humans as rational beings capable of determining and regulating their own social , economic , and political affairs . The " liberal " aspect of liberal democratic theory takes its meaning from the philosophical rather than the political usage of the term -- a meaning that is derived from " liberty . " Both Immanuel Kant and Thomas Jefferson endorsed this view of human nature . Reacting against the dominant Christian theological view that human nature was fundamentally corrupt and in need of divine guidance and deliverance from itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings as fundamentally rational and profoundly educable . Knowledge resulting from free , unfettered inquiry was viewed as providing not only the basis for understanding the natural world but also for humans understanding themselves , including their social and political selves . Thus human beings came to be regarded as embodying the ability to consider and value the common good and to provide for the social and political arrangements that improve the human condition . The notion of self-government had to be proceeded by the belief that human beings are capable of self-government . <p> Clarifying the distinction between the private lives of the citizens of a democracy and the public arena in which public policy and legislation are debated and formulated is crucial to liberal democratic theory . John Locke made clear , for example , in A Letter Concerning Toleration , that the business of the civil magistrate and the business of the church must be completely distinct . Locke maintained that " the only business of the church is the salvation of souls " and the only circumstances in which the state has an interest are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . <p> The distinction between public and private life is one Jefferson used as the crux of his justification for his wall separating church and state . Not only is religion a private matter in Jefferson 's view , there are also pernicious effects due to the mingling of private matters of religion and public affairs of state . James Madison concurred , claiming that the papal system , wherein church and the state are n't separated , represents " the worst form of governments . " The wall of separation was thus intended to prevent what Thomas Paine later called the " adulterous connection of church and state . " <p> At the time the U.S. Constitution was framed there was considerable debate amongst the various states concerning whether government should establish recognized connections between religion ( i.e. , Protestant Christianity ) and the state or whether it should explicitly disestablish such connections . Some delegates , insisting that the United States was a Christian nation , tried but failed in an attempt to include such recognition in the Constitution . Given the pressure from various religious groups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is an often-overlooked act of statesmanship of enormous proportion that the delegates to the Constitutional Congress were able to set aside their own particular beliefs in the framing of the document . The de facto separation of church and state created in the Constitution by this absence of references to Christianity or other religions was widely and strongly criticized by many religious leaders at the time . Debates in state legislatures concerning adoption of the Constitution were often heated , with much concern expressed about religious freedom and with several states insisting that a guarantee of religious freedom be included in a bill of rights . This debate led to the First Amendment in 1789 . The movement toward complete disestablishment of religion in all of the states was a slow , gradual , multifaceted process that involved Congress , the Office of the President , the Supreme Court , and state legislatures and continued until the mid-twentieth century . Indeed , some might say it still continues today . <p> But if a democratic government is to nurture and maximize human freedom then it must provide constitutional protections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including religious beliefs . In order to do this , a constitutional democracy needs to provide constitutional guarantees that prohibit civil penalties , denial of civil privileges , or granting of special civil privileges on the basis of religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) on the part of any citizen . <p> Locke 's words are still directly on point in this regard : his claim that " it is above all things necessary to distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion " provides a mechanism to put an end to the otherwise endless religious controversies in a pluralistic society that prevent the peaceful and smooth functioning of a well-ordered society . The fundamental claims that are to be incorporated into the constitution must be justifiable to all citizens , and this can not be done if the justification appeals to one set of religious beliefs rather than another . In order to construct a constitution on principles that all citizens will agree to , one must appeal only to human reason . This is the lesson that is preserved in philosopher John Rawls ' Principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which considers such matters as " who has the right to vote , or what religions are to be tolerated , or who is to be assured equality of opportunity , or to hold property . " <p> However , not everyone agrees that the fundamental constitutional issues should be debated and decided by appeal only to reason . For example , Nicholas Wolterstorff maintains that the separation of public civic life from private religious life discriminates against religious believers by requiring them to act politically while denying or ignoring their religious beliefs , and that setting their religious beliefs aside in such circumstances might very well be contrary to or a violation of those religious beliefs . This situation generates a paradox for liberal democratic theory , according to Wolterstorff , since liberal democratic theory is based upon the fundamental commitment to equality and freedom ; however , for the religious person , such a commitment might be based upon religious belief . In his view , by denying the religious person the right to appeal to religious belief to justify the most fundamental principles of democracy , liberal democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , and the religious person would presumably be denied the freedom to act upon his or her religious belief . <p> To respond to Wolterstorff 's criticism of the separation of public civic reason and private religious belief , it is necessary to be clear about exactly what his complaint is . In order to generate the apparent paradox , it appears that Wolterstorff must be claiming that the religious person 's commitment to equality and freedom is based solely and exclusively upon religious belief . Ought a person be allowed to appeal to religious belief as the exclusive justification for valuing equality and individual freedom on the constitutional level and would the failure to allow such an appeal be paradoxical to liberal democratic theory ? The answers to these questions become apparent when the questions are generalized . <p> Of course a person might hold a belief p on religious grounds , but p might also be justified to others on non-religious grounds in a manner that appeals to reason . The Principle of Political Legitimacy would require the religious person in such a situation to translate the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public reason in order to justify p to others . If p is a claim that can be justified only by an appeal to some religious authority or tradition , which does not play the same justificatory role for others , then according to the Principle of Political Legitimacy the religious person has no right to expect the adoption of p on the constitutional level . If p is some belief supportive of liberal democratic theory , then it initially appears that the part of liberal democratic theory that endorses individual freedom would be undermined since the religious person would be denied the freedom to promote ( and perhaps establish ) p on the basis of religious belief alone . However , if there is no general prohibition against the introduction of p solely on religious grounds and p is a belief that is contrary to or incompatible with the fundamental values of equality and freedom , then it would be impossible to provide constitutional guarantees for those fundamental values . Different people might come to the public table of constitutional debate with different religious agendas , based solely on religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurdle of the same kind of intractable disagreements that had plagued Western Europe for centuries during its religious wars . <p> To jumpstart the process of framing a democratic constitution , the private religious beliefs of those doing the framing must be set aside . And this is exactly what the framers of the Constitution of the United States were able to do . <p> Now compare this to the current situation in Iraq . In the latter case we have a modern-day laboratory experiment of an attempt to develop a democratic government and frame a constitution . What is to be the role of Islam in the resulting structure ? The Shiites and the Sunnis each want a piece of the pie , as do the non-Arab Kurds , while members of the Baath Socialist Party have been denied participation . The situation is strikingly similar to the one that faced those responsible for drafting the U.S. Constitution . <p> There are , of course , other important issues to be resolved in Iraq . But in order to provide for a peaceful , stable , well-ordered society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship between religion and whatever kind of state emerges from the process . If the expectation is to arrive at a result that is comparable to the liberal democracy of the United States , then the answer to the question of what the relationship should be between religion and the state must be the same . The only general and permanent guarantee of religious freedom and protection of religious minorities is a constitutional separation of religion and government . Thus the shadow of Thomas Jefferson looms large over the process of drafting the constitution for a democratic Iraq . If the eventual result is to be a democratic government that values and protects individual liberty and equality , then the answer to the question of what governmental role Islam is to have is clear : none . <p> There are two differences between Christianity and Islam that are worth explaining , since they are directly related to the two philosophical preconditions of liberal democratic theory . First , as a result of the Protestant Reformation , Protestantism recognized and adopted the view of human nature discussed above , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast to Roman Catholicism , Protestantism became non-hierarchical and , one might say , more democratic . Second , much of Protestant Christianity ( although certainly not all of Protestantism , such as the Puritans ) came also to separate theology from politics and religion from the everyday civic lives of individuals . This is why the distinction between the private , individual religious life and the public , civic secular life , which is crucial for Jefferson 's separation of church and state , became possible . <p> This crucial separation is n't a part of early Islam , nor is it to be found in Orthodox Judaism or Confucianism ( nor , one might add , in Roman Catholicism , early Protestantism , and many forms of American Christian fundamentalism ) . Moreover , there is little optimism that the distinction can be drawn for Islam in a way that separates religion from political or civic life , since Muhammad gave laws that explicitly connect theology with politics . The significance of the lack of this distinction for the prospects of a peaceful , well-ordered liberal democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now insist that Iraq must be an Islamic country just as many fundamentalist Christians now insist that the United States must be a Christian country . <p> Indeed , the separation of religion and state , the separation of the spiritual and the secular , which is essential to liberal democratic theory , is the very source of what some Muslims take to be the corruption of Western democracies . Such a separation is not only unacceptable to them but is regarded as complete anathema to Islamic thought . Thus the separation of religion and state is not only regarded as a political mistake , it is regarded as a theological mistake as well . In this regard , perhaps ironically , fundamentalist Islam , Orthodox Judaism , and fundamentalist Christianity have much in common . <p> On the constitutional level , there can no more be an Islamic democracy than there can be a Christian or Orthodox Jewish democracy . A religious liberal democracy is an oxymoron . A liberal democracy designed to protect and maximize human freedom and to provide for equality of opportunity and treatment must not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this prospect of secularization that most threatens some fundamentalist Muslims , since secularization is seen as posing a direct threat to their religion . <p> Because one of the most basic philosophical preconditions for a liberal democracy is establishing the wall of separation between religion and state , the future in this respect does n't look promising . To date , Turkey is the only previously Islamic country that is now a democracy . And recently , devout religious believers have forced some concessions and compromises from the state that raise questions about the long-term viability of Turkey 's democracy . Although Israel is often blithely referred to as a democracy , it is n't a liberal democracy but a very limited one -- a closed democracy -- in which democratic guarantees are prescribed for a limited subset of citizens . For example , the state of Israel does n't recognize any civil ceremony for marriage . Only the Orthodox Jewish ceremony is recognized as legal , and no inter-religious marriages are allowed . <p> To best ensure that a society is secure , stable , and peacefully well ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected from the incursion of religion in all forms and on all levels . It does n't take a religious jihad to threaten a liberal democracy ; it only takes allowing the " the first experiment on our liberties , " as Madison writes -- the first wedge of religion into the structure of the state . <p> Certainly not all fanatics are religious , but the ones who are tend to operate on the same principle : that some religious belief or claim must be placed in the position of ultimate authority . The religious fanatic who opposes abortion by bombing abortion clinics acts on the same principle as the religious fanatic who burns an embassy in protest of so-called blasphemous cartoons published in the embassy 's home country . Both are resorting to violence to damage the state in order to prompt a change in its laws or policies on the basis of some religious belief . Both are religious fanatics acting upon religious beliefs that are immune to reason . The only difference is in the magnitude of the attacks and the number of victims . Both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Among those who at present debate the relationship between church and state , there would undoubtedly be more agreement about the necessity for the separation on the constitutional level than there would be about the necessity for the separation ( and the meaning of separation ) within a constitutional democracy . Once a democratic constitution is in place , as the long history of conflicts and court decisions in the United States makes clear , fixing the boundaries between religion and the state becomes trickier . On the legislative level , where individual laws and public policies are determined , what is the proper role of religious beliefs ? There must be additional restraints operative that establish a prima facie obligation upon citizens to refrain from appealing to privately held religious beliefs in the public forum in which the affairs of state are conducted . The difficulty will be in justifying restraints upon appeals to religious beliefs given the constitutional guarantees of the disestablishment of religion ( that is now taken as prohibiting any governmental endorsement of religion ) and the free exercise of religion ( that is now taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Robert Audi in his book Religious Commitment and Secular Reason , a citizen in a liberal democracy has a prima facie obligation to appeal only to secular reason or to be sufficiently motivated only by secular reason to support or oppose legislation or policy in the public arena . If a person is originally motivated solely by religious belief or has a religious belief as the sole reason for advocating or opposing a particular action by the state , then that belief or that reason needs to be reformulated into a rationale or an argument that appeals to human reason . <p> Perhaps the most significant feature of religious reason , and perhaps the feature from which all the other differences between religious reason and secular reason derive , is the oft-touted claim by believers that religious reasons carry an infallible supreme authority that guarantees the truth of such claims against all potential epistemic defeaters . However , allowing appeals to such religious reasons , held to be infallible , in the public arena where laws and public policies are made , would result in what Audi calls a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death , " that is , an epistemic dead end from which there is no retreat or escape . This would obviously threaten the peaceful and well-ordered stability of a liberal democracy . <p> But , is not disagreement and conflict simply one of the prices to be paid for a liberal democracy ? There are numerous cases where the free exercise of religion and privately held religious beliefs have apparently come into conflict with public reason . The followers of Christian Science , for example , often refuse conventional medical treatment for their minor children on the basis of religious beliefs . Some fundamentalist Muslim parents force female circumcision upon their minor daughters on the basis of religious beliefs . Gay marriage and abortion are opposed by many on the basis of religious beliefs . And some support the public display of the Ten Commandments on government property on the basis of religious beliefs . <p> In each of these cases , the proper approach is to separate the religious interest from the civic interest and to require , in those cases where the religious interest is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic concern be put in nonreligious terms . Most importantly , in a pluralistic , liberal democracy this must be done in a way that guarantees equal protection , in this case religious parity , for all . <p> How might equilibrium amongst competing religious beliefs and equal protection ever be achieved unless a wall of separation between church and state is maintained ? The simple , straightforward answer is that it can not . Equal treatment and the establishment of religion are inversely proportional . To the extent that one religion is given preferential or privileged treatment , others are denied equal treatment . <p> Locke maintained that citizens should be allowed free exercise of religion except in cases where such exercise harms society or poses the possibility of social harm . It is certainly permissible for people to believe whatever they prefer on whatever grounds they choose in their private lives . However , if those same beliefs are used as the basis for legislation or public policy , it is easy to see that a line has been crossed where the introduction of private religious beliefs into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of religion to the public arena threatens to destroy the underlying theoretical framework of the very democratic guarantee of the free exercise of religion itself . In a liberal democracy the exclusion of religion from the government arena is the only way to provide for the peaceful stability of a well-ordered society that protects the free expression of religion in the private lives of citizens . <p> By James F.

##4020261 A political traditionalist critiques our pseudo-conservative president <p> In 1954 the celebrated American historian Richard Hofstadter offered his explanation for McCarthyism in an essay he contributed to THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR titled " The Pseudo-Conservative Revolt . " Looking back on his essay 11 years later , Hofstadter noted : " I have written nothing else of comparable brevity that aroused more attention or drew more requests for quotation or reprinting . " <p> Seeking to understand the underlying social psychology of McCarthyism , Hofstadter borrowed the term pseudo-conservative from the philosopher Theodor Adorno to designate Americans who cloaked their " serious and restless dissatisfaction with American life , traditions and institutions " in the guise and rhetoric of conservatism . Hofstadter , who studied alternative explanations for political conduct , hypothesized that the dissatisfaction of 1950s pseudo-conservatives was based on a fear of loss of status common to open societies where social mobility is relatively fluid . <p> Compounding their fear in the McCarthy era was anxiety generated by the post-World War II nuclear arms race , which created a doomsday scenario in the minds of many Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alienated groups began describing themselves as conservative because the term appeared to identify them as being diametrically opposed to the forces riley perceived were threatening both their lives mad their social positions . As Hofstadter pointed out , however , from a strictly political perspective there was nothing authentically conservative about their arguments . In the first place , they were trying desperately to overturn the status quo of New Deal America -- not to conserve it . Furthermore , they adhered to an ideology of anti-intellectualism , substituting feelings and emotions for the rational discourse that for millennia has characterized the history of Western conservative thought . " The pseudo-conservative tends to be more than ordinarily incoherent " about political issues , Hofstadter wrote . The result , he maintained , was a politics that emphasized unarticulated psychological impulses over reasonable analysis -- a politics of the gut , in other words , rather than of the mind . <p> Another reason Hofstadter considered McCarthyism to be a form of pseudo-conservatism had to do with the rage with which it expressed its opposition to the American political system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political philosophy is analogous to conservatism as a personality trait . Both stress moderation , practicality , and prudence . " Look before you leap " and " a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush " might well be their credos . As Hofstadter reminded readers of THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR , however , McCarthyism had virtually nothing " in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism in the classical sense of the word . " <p> Today another form of pseudo-conservatism threatens American institutions . Under the administration of George W. Bush , our public policy has for six years been shaped by those who discount reason to practice a politics of largely inchoate sentiments . <p> In order to recognize the counterfeit quality of the pseudo-conservatism that Hofstadter identified , as well as the " compassionate conservatism " Bush sometimes espouses , one has only to turn to the political philosophies of Aristotle and Edmund Burke . It is in their works , notably Aristotle 's Politics and Nicomachean Ethics and Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found . At the heart of Aristotle 's and Burke 's thinking is a belief in the existence of natural law , a set of moral ideals that gives meaning to such terms as honor , integrity , justice , and courage . Neither Aristotle nor Burke possessed much faith in the rationality and morality of human beings . They feared that without the guidance that natural law provides , humans would forfeit their opportunities to lead virtuous lives and establish just governments . Because Aristotle and Burke considered them to be universal , these moral ideas were meant to apply to every human relationship -- including economics . <p> Aristotle and Burke supported private property and free enterprise on the basis of the distinguishing characteristic of human beings -- the possession of a soul that makes it possible for us to exercise free will and become unique individuals . One of the advantages of private property , they taught , is that it helps us to develop and manifest our individuality as well as to express one of their most cherished ideals , generosity . If people did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a largely empty virtue . But Aristotle 's and Burke 's support for private property and free enterprise was not unlimited . The standards of natural law require owners to treat workers the same way they would like to be treated if the roles were reversed and challenge merchants to provide consumers with a fair product at a fair price . <p> From this perspective , what makes the Bush administration an example of pseudo-conservatism is its dogmatic commitment to laissez-faire policies that deny the relevance of universal ideals and that rely primarily on market forces to guide economic activities . In its pursuit of laissez-faire economic policies , the Bush administration has relaxed banking standards , introduced no-bid government contracts , allowed private corporations greater access to public lands , and refrained from limiting monopolistic practices . It has sought , furthermore , to reduce governmental responsibility for the welfare of its elderly citizens by advocating the privatization of Social Security accounts . <p> By assuming that some form of economic justice will result from the relatively unchecked selfishness of individuals and corporations , the policies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human behavior . Reinhold Niebuhr 's The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness ( 1944 ) echoed Aristotle 's and Burke 's rejection of unlimited economic freedom for its smug optimism . Only people who think of themselves as " harmless egotists , " Niebuhr remarked , could fail to understand that when the " economic process is left severely alone either the strong devour the weak , in which case monopoly displaces competition , or competition breeds chaos in the community . " <p> Consistent in its inconsistency , the Bush administration celebrates economic freedom while acting to curtail other basic American freedoms , such as privacy , religion , speech , and press . The same government that hesitates to apply explicit moral standards to economic behavior has had few qualms about restricting the Fourth Amendment right against warrantless searches , loosening rules on the confidentiality of medical records , supporting faith-based initiatives that cause citizens to subsidize religions to which they do not belong , ordering librarians to divulge information on material checked out by patrons , and attempting to influence the content of National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its approach to sexual issues . Among the manifestations of pseudo-conservatism that Hofstadter observed in 1954 was the vindictive quality of the policies it espoused . By opposing abortion as well as convenient access to birth control , the administration has demonstrated a punitive attitude toward sexual conduct . <p> Another serious disconnect between the Bush administration and traditional Western political conservatism is its foreign policy . Although Aristotle and Burke believed in universal ideals , they were not idealists . Instead , they practiced a politics of prudence that seeks to adjust immutable natural laws to constantly changing situations and circumstances . The unique value of prudence , Aristotle wrote , is its ability to ensure that governments do the right thing at the right time " in the fight way . " Burke called prudence " the first of all virtues " because it alone can teach governments how to bring " power and right " into harmony . Indeed , Burke 's famous criticism of the French Revolution was based upon his appreciation of political prudence . <p> Although Burke promoted the ideal of free government as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prudence taught him that societies are organisms that require great care in order to endure and flourish . They can be modified , consequently , only with considerable thought and patience . At the end of the 18th century , France had been living under feudal autocrats for centuries . When the revolutionaries ignored their past and tried to introduce a historically unprecedented level of " liberty , fraternity , and equality " into their society virtually overnight , Burke predicted that death and destruction beyond anything the French had ever experienced would soon transpire . <p> Burke favored the American Revolution , on the other hand , because he judged Americans , as former English men and women , to be seeking to adapt traditional English ideals of self-rule for their new home . He considered their Coal to be a relatively moderate one that would serve to lay a firm foundation for the evolution of free government in the United States . Burke explained this in his Reflections : <p> I flatter myself that I love a manly , moral , regulated liberty as well as any gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blame to anything which relates to human actions , and human concerns , on a simple view of the object , as it stands stripped of every relation , in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction . Circumstances ( which with some gentlemen pass for nothing ) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour and discriminating effect . The circumstances are what render every civil mid political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind . <p> By Aristotle 's and Burke 's theories of evolutionary change , the Bush administration 's decisions to invade and occupy Iraq were clearly imprudent . A number of explanations have been offered to justify these policies . One was that Saddam Hussein possessed nuclear weapons . Another was that he was in league with Al Qaeda terrorists who attacked the United States on 9/11 . The latest is that we need to remake Iraq into a democracy that will serve as a political role model for the rest of the Middle East . Although the first two explanations have been discredited by the thorough investigations of several bipartisan congressional committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them . This strategy calls to mind Hofstadter 's observation that pseudo-conservatives are suspicious of reasonable analysis and often rely on knee-jerk reactions to reach policy decisions . <p> As Bush 's former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill revealed in Ron Suskind 's book The Price of Loyalty ( 2004 ) , the president in 2001 -- for reasons that were never explained fully and seemed like a snap judgment at the time -- informed his cabinet that he was thinking seriously about overthrowing Saddam . It was especially shocking to O'Neill that Bush announced his convictions about Iraq only 10 days after his inauguration and a full eight months before 9/11 . " Conviction is something you need in order to act , " O'Neill said . " But your action needs to be proportional to the depth of evidence that underlies your conviction . " <p> The third explanation is even more bewildering from a traditional conservative point of view . Iraq has never come close to being a democracy . The Iraqi people have never been free and rarely have shown an inclination to fight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , the administration 's vision of a democratic Iraq is reminiscent of the mistakes made by the French revolutionaries . Both acted as if dreams can easily be translated into political reality . Both upheld the ideal of freedom , but neither was able to adapt that ideal to the specific circumstances they encountered . Both were unable to appreciate the staggering costs in human lives and property that are unavoidable when radical change is pursued over a very short period of time . <p> The Bush administration 's attitudes toward the national debt and the environment represent another break with the Western conservative tradition . Aristotle 's and Burke 's writings remind today 's generations that we have a moral responsibility to leave the world a better place for our descendants . This is why , Walter Lippmann explained in Essays in the Public Philosophy ( 1955 ) , " young men die in battle for their country 's sake and why old men plant trees they will never sit under . " After six years of a supply-side economic policy that increases government spending but declines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration has left our children with a national debt of more than $8 trillion . By refusing to ratify the international Kyoto Protocol on global warming , deciding against requiring automobile manufacturers to raise fuel-efficiency ratings , withdrawing funds from the EPA , FEMA , and the Corps of Engineers , and discouraging wetlands-preservation projects , the administration may have set the stage for future environmental catastrophes on the order of Hurricane Katrina . Our children will have to cope with these disasters . <p> Other similarities between Bush administration policies and Hofstadter 's description of pseudoconservatism include : hostility toward the United Nations ; a penchant for amending the Constitution ; an insistence on political conformity ; an inability to make subtle distinctions between international players , which is required for effectiveness on the world political stage ; and a reliance on the populist rhetoric of anti-intellectualism . John Bolton , Bush 's U.N . ambassador , has taken the position that the institution is largely irrelevant . The Bush administration has supported amendments to the Constitution regarding flag burning and homosexual marriage . Americans who want to set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as traitorous " cut-and-runners . " The failure of Senator McCarthy and his followers in 1954 to recognize that communist regimes in the Soviet Union , China , Yugoslavia , and Vietnam were different seems similar to the Bush administration 's insistence that organizations such as Al Qaeda , Hezbollah , and Hamas are all part of a unified group of " Islamofascist " terrorists . Furthermore , the Bush administration 's approach to such issues as creationism , placing replicas of the Ten Commandments in public places , and the Terri Schiavo debacle contains a good deal of anti-intellectual populist rhetoric . <p> Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Hofstadter 's 1954 AMERICAN SCHOLAR essay is its ability to explain more than 50 years later why traditional conservatives tend to get so exasperated with the Bush administration . Traditional conservatives -- of whom I am one -- consider themselves loyal citizens who want to believe that their president knows what he is doing . So we keep trying , with little success , to appreciate the logic of his budget deficits , incoherent foreign policies , attacks on constitutional rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hofstadter teaches us is that these policies were never meant to be understood logically in die first place . As he wrote in a later essay , " Pseudo-Conservatism Revisited -- 1965 " : <p> As a rule , pseudo-conservatism does more to express emotions than to formulate policies . It is in fact hard to translate the claims of its policies into programs or concrete objectives . and for the most part the proponents of such politics , being less concerned with the uses of power than with its " alleged misuse , do not offer positive programs to solve social problems . The operative content of their demands is more likely to be negative : they call on us mainly to prohibit , to prevent , to censor and censure , to discredit , and to punish . <p> Despite the brilliance of Hofstadter 's analysis , there is a major difference between pseudo-conservatism and its traditional counterpart that he neglected to discuss . Aristotle 's and Burke 's pessimistic view of human nature , their belief in a system of natural law that sets moral parameters for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciates the difficulties involved in translating morally preferable ideals into politically feasible policies , and their commitment to moderation and caution are major components of traditional conservatism 's emphasis on doubt and limits . Traditional conservatives believe that the universe imposes profound restrictions on what individuals and governments can accomplish . They adhere , according to Noel O'Sullivan in his book Conservatism ( 1976 ) , to a " philosophy of imperfection , committed to the idea of limits " that regards human beings as " imperfect , dependent " creatures who are " doomed to make the best of things by the more modest policies of compromise and accommodation . " <p> The Bush administration , however , has not consistently recognized doubt and limitations . Despite the burgeoning national debt , the administration declines to heed the advice of fiscal conservatives either to raise taxes or seriously reduce public spending . Despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina , the administration persists in ignoring the warnings of prominent scientists about the destructive effects of global warming . Despite former Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki 's concern that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the administration went ahead with its preconceived plan for a diminished force . With a certainty bordering on arrogance , the administration has behaved as if it believes the national debt somehow will disappear , nature will heal global warming on its own , and Iraqis will soon come to their senses , welcome Americans as their saviors , and conclude that democracy is preferable to secular or religious tyranny . <p> Certainty in the face of strong evidence to the contrary is the hallmark of ideological thinking . Ultimately , it is the ideological quality of Bush administration policies that classifies them as pseudo-conservative . Whereas ideologues advance one doctrinaire solution to every problem regardless of the circumstances , traditional conservatives expect political leaders to adjust their convictions to the situation at hand . Whereas ideologues prefer to deal with political abstractions , traditional conservatives seek to practice a more practical form of politics that operates , in Burke 's words , on a level of " the more or less , the earlier or the later , and on a balance of advantage and inconvenience , of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional conservative limits and doubts has been the administration 's adherence to a strategy for presidential leadership that it calls the " doctrine of the unitary executive . " Among the people who participated in the formulation of this doctrine were Bush appointees Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Justice Samuel Alito . Gonzales helped to develop it when he served as Bush 's White House counsel ; Alito , when he was a lawyer in Ronald Reagan 's Justice Department . To the administration the " doctrine of the unitary executive " means that the executive branch can interpret laws any way it wants -- even if its interpretation differs markedly from the directives of Congress and the Supreme Court . <p> Although this doctrine represents an egregious violation of the separation of powers , the president has used it with impunity . Bush has claimed that he will disregard laws prohibiting warrantless wiretapping of domestic phone calls . He has said that he intends to ignore the provisions of the Patriot Act with which he disagrees . When Bush announced that he vehemently opposed the Military Commissions Act being considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torture enemy combatants , Congress caved in to the president 's pressure and virtually granted him the power to interpret the Geneva Convention as he sees fit . <p> With the two-term presidential limit in effect and the end of the Bush administration in sight , can we expect that pseudo-conservatism is about to run its course ? Do the recent midterm election results indicate that moderate Americans have grown disillusioned with pseudo-conservative policies ? Only for the time being , Hofstadter would maintain . Just as McCarthyism was followed by the presidential campaigns of Barry Goldwater and George Wallace , Richard Nixon 's " Silent Majority , " the Reagan presidency , and the current administration , it is inevitable that another version of pseudo-conservatism will appear on the American political scene . <p> As long as citizens remain fearful of their status in society and as long as Americans continue to dread attacks from powerful enemies committed to the destruction of their country , Hofstadter warned , the specter of pseudoconservatism never will completely vanish . In 1954 , he prophetically noted : " We do live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already shown us the ugliest capacities of the human spirit . . These considerations suggest that the pseudo-conservative political style . is one of the long waves of contemporary American history and not a momentary mood .

##4020266 He was washing E 's body before calling the mortician when he had another thought : Where 's the fire . <p> The longer he thought , the more he saw that his chore was not readying her for burial , but finding how to keep her above ground . He had to be able to see her , that was not negotiable , and with all the to-ing and fro-ing of the hospice people in the last months , he 'd like very much to keep outsiders outside , where they belonged . What he needed was a comprehensive tutorial , a how-to . <p> He kissed her cool forehead , covered her with a sheet and left for the library . <p> The librarian at the reference desk directed him to Egypt , and there he spent the afternoon . <p> The basic principle was dryness . This was something he could wrap his mind around . A step-by-step thing to do . Problem . Solution . That 's what his life had been made of ; was what , besides her , he had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , checked on her . No change . Then he watched a show on autopsies he 'd TiVo 'd . The coroner said some bodies they dug up in crime investigations were " mummified . " The secret , as he 'd discovered at the library , was to keep her dry . <p> But what about what 's inside ? <p> He read deeper in the Egyptians . Deep for a layman , not to mention pretty grisly . A slit in the side , through which the organs are to be withdrawn . The problem of packing material absorbed the rest of the night and most of the next several days . <p> He was busy , occupied in reinventing the tools of the Egyptians , and then applying them to real flesh . Problems , solutions . He breathed shallowly as he worked , ignoring time . The blood let -- who would 've thought that she had so much left , after all that suffering . He did everything the Egyptians had done , except for the grey matter , which they 'd extracted through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point her whole body sighed . He took a break then . Important to keep the alternatives clear : burial or burning . That 's what they 'd do to her , what they could hardly wait to do . Put her where he could n't see her . <p> She 'd died at home . It 's how she wanted it . They never pretended she was n't dying . He 'd asked if she had any preference : burial or cremation . That 's how they were with each other . <p> " Oh for Pete 's sake , " she said . " Leave it at the curb . I 'm sick to death of it . " <p> Well I 'm not , honey , he 'd said . <p> But she just turned away . Very unsentimental , right to the end . <p> He returned to the hardware store . They did n't have the needles he needed , and referred him to a sewing store in the mall . <p> The stitching was slow going . On the left side , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so himself . He admired his handiwork until , struck by the resemblance to a Peeping Tom , he went in search of the right garment . <p> The pink thing was a favorite , but she looked ashen when he draped it across . He found a white negligee she used on trips . <p> What it is , he said , lifting her shoulders to slip the negligee down , is that we 're one person . Where you go , I go . <p> He paused to regard her on the guest bed . It could be any ordinary day . She could have said , " Just a little lie down and I 'll be right as rain . " She liked naps . <p> He studied her feet , decided to leave them bare . They looked like marble . The stiffening made her seem smaller . A small hard house of bone . She was in there , though . He could feel it . <p> He glanced at the window . Dark again . His brain felt burnt-out and he smelled of ozone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed . <p> Too lonesome in the queen-size , he dragged the comforter across the hall to lie down next to her , but her stillness kept him awake . She seemed to give off cool the way she used to give off heat . <p> He returned to their bed . It would be easier if he could see her . When he raised his head , all he saw was her feet . It was n't right , the guest bed . Not personal or special . <p> It came to him in the night , as his inventions usually did . The pool table . Elevate her . More like a proper . bier . They 'd gotten it when they were first flush . No sooner was it through the door than he 'd replaced the granite with a plastic he 'd read was better than stone , then re-laid the felt , just because he could . This makes it light enough to move . <p> But too bulky to move alone . Who would help and not ask questions ? <p> Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventions set him free . Clyde never asked questions . <p> Clyde and his wife bred cats . He 'd been to the house . Cats were everywhere like ants , and the smell made your eyes water . The oddest thing was Clyde 's wife looked just like one , with green eyes and a pink triangular nose . <p> Clyde immediately responded to his e-mail . He 'd just come home from Vegas and was sorry as hell to hear about his wife , though he knew she 'd been real sick . And sorry too that they 'd never got together as couples like they 'd meant to . <p> Clyde came over and studied the pool table . He ran his hand over the felt and said , " Pretty nice to live like King Tut . " This was so close to mummifying as to amaze his host , but then , everyone knew about King Tut . <p> Clyde lifted the table edge , gauging the heft . " Got to be one of yours . Light as a feather . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wish I could think of that stuff . Awkward size , though . Where to , boss ? " <p> He said there were two flights to hump it up . Clyde sighed , " Let 's do ' er . " <p> " Which way ? " he asked when they got upstairs . Only a flicker of curiosity in his eyes as they passed the closed guest door . <p> They set it next to the queen-size . " Now that 's what I call decadent , " Clyde said . " Pool table right next to the bed . " <p> But the table was wrong . The green felt top was like AstroTurf , too bright in the room , which she had done up in pastels . It would n't work with the way her skin was looking . He 'd think of something later . <p> He led Clyde downstairs and they had a beer and talked office politics . Clyde said he 'd keep in touch , and maybe they could shoot some pool or whatever . Watching the car pull away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage . He did n't envy Clyde , even if his wife was alive . <p> Next day he went to Bed , Bath and Beyond , and was waited on by a man with black splotches on his hands that could pass for decay . But this guy was young . Then he got it . An AIDS survivor . <p> The man said he was Ray . How could he help ? <p> Since Ray would know about suffering , not to mention death , he almost unloaded on the spot , and waited for it to pass , blinking at shelves of pillows that reached to the ceiling . <p> Then he told Ray he needed a spread , and read off the dimensions of the pool table . <p> Ray frowned . " I 'm trying to imagine what a bed that size looks like . " <p> I 'm an inventor , he explained , which satisfied Ray , who trotted all over and brought back a comforter . Floral . That 's how she 'd done the bedroom . Floral pastels . Silky to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could melt . <p> Ray was looking sideways at him . " Is it for yourself ? " <p> Well yes and no , he said , and squinted at Ray , taking his measure . <p> What would you say if I told you it 's for my dead wife ? That I 'm keeping her so I remember who she is , which is everything . You know , like a mummy . <p> " Well I 'd say , Bonne chance , " said Ray . <p> Well thank you , he said , and then put a hand over his eyes , which had welled from out of nowhere , a knot in his throat . <p> Aisle Three , a voice came over the loudspeaker . Then something garbled . The squeak of a cart going by . <p> Now he put his hand on his chest and moved it clockwise , which helped . Pulled out a handkerchief , blew his nose . Ray was standing with his head bowed . <p> Ray said , " I 'm just going to nip in back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse for wear . " He disappeared , returned . " You know what ? I have another idea . What about a featherbed ? " A featherbed ? <p> " Follow me . " <p> He followed Ray to another section where sound was suctioned off by yards of foam and feathers . Bedspreads hung from shelves . <p> Ray pointed to a bed . " Try her out . " <p> He sat on the bed . The give seemed infinite . <p> Ray frowned . " I hope you do n't think I 'm trying to run up the sale . But , it 's the ultimate kindness , do n't you think ? " <p> I 'll take a king , he said . <p> " Coming right up , " said Ray , and vanished again . <p> He perched on the display bed , and thought of the coffin racket . The funeral industry . Another clerk went by and smiled but he did n't smile back . He seldom did . His parents , who 'd been farmers , had n't either . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very helpful , he said to Ray . <p> " Give her my best , " said Ray . " And happy trails . " <p> With the featherbed beneath her she floated on a cloud . And the comforter was great . She looked like she was dreaming on a field of flowers . <p> He marked the two-week anniversary on the calendar . Halfway through the drying-out period recommended by the Egyptians and not a scent from her , not a whiff . Things were coming along nicely . <p> Then the worst happened . He forgot not to pick up after placing a pizza order , and there , on the other end of the line , was the whisky-voice of the sister , H , down in Palo Alto . <p> They were n't close , but H was older and took a supervisory interest . For instance , H believed that her baby sister , in her " heart of hearts , " had wanted kids . This was because H could n't seem to stop having them , until nature put a foot down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The last time he 'd talked to H was right after she 'd died , before he stopped answering the phone . She 'd asked if she could do anything , which others had also asked . Evidently there was something to be done , but nobody knew what that was . <p> Around this time , casseroles had begun appearing on the porch . Casserole was n't a real word , he 'd looked it up ; it was like naming pie after the pan you cooked it in . <p> So he 'd asked H what to do with all those casseroles . <p> " I 'm sure they mean well , " she 'd said . <p> Now she cut to the chase : " What 's going on up there ? Do n't you ever check your messages ? When 's the service ? Time is marching on , Arnold . " <p> He blinked at the ceiling , imagining E on her featherbed . I had her cremated , he said . <p> " What ? You what ? " <p> Cremated . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood relation ? Are you there ? " <p> Cremation was what she wanted , he said . <p> " I knew her before you were even in the picture , and she was terrified of fire . What have you done with my sister ? " <p> Her ashes are on the bookshelf in the den even as we speak . They were still warm when I picked them up from the funeral people . <p> " They were not , do n't say things like that . " <p> A silence . <p> " Are you there ? What about a service ? " <p> She did n't want one . <p> " That tears it . I 'm coming up there . I got an open ticket . " Her voice rumbled on , a locomotive headed down the track . <p> I 'm going away . To Hawaii . On the red-eye . <p> " Hawaii . Now I 've heard everything -- " <p> He held the phone away and thought of E upstairs again , looking peaceful , maybe even amused . <p> H was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute worst . a bookshelf , like a bowling trophy . " <p> Enough . He hung up . <p> Clyde e-mailed asking him bowling . He wondered if this was ESP or simple coincidence , and settled on the latter . Clyde and his wife had bowled forever . <p> Clyde 's wife was small and quiet , Clyde large and bombastic . <p> He enjoyed their banter . He enjoyed the smells of rubber and wood and sweat . He 'd somehow forgotten bowling . Movies , that 's another one . <p> Afterward , they went to a place with Naugahyde booths . Clyde ordered French dip and his wife a Caesar . Suddenly famished , he ordered both . They told him about cats . The shows , the illnesses , the kitty mills . <p> In the parking lot , Clyde said , " How you hanging ? " His wife said , " Yes , how are you doing ? Such a hard thing . " <p> He said he was keeping her and found that to be working . So he did n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wife said , " I think it 's the voice you forget . Faces you have pictures of . " <p> That 's a good point , he said . I 've got her on the answering machine . I 'm glad you mentioned it , because I forgot . <p> As soon as he got home , he played her voice on the machine . He 'd almost forgotten that she had such a sweet voice , with a little break in it that was all hers . There were also messages up the yin-yang . Later . For now , he fixed a bowl of Pecan Frenzy and listened again . <p> He fell asleep in the chair , and woke at daylight . The house was very still . He thought of her upstairs all alone , and went up . <p> He was n't sure what he 'd hoped the effect would be after a night apart , but she did n't look real anymore , and the whole scene struck him wrong . <p> He sat on the queen-size and thought of graves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photos of the person buried there . They 'd reminded him of stakes with pictures his mother had stuck in garden rows . <p> It was as if a veil had been placed over her face . She also seemed to be sinking .

##4020267 Roy had a job changing tires and pumping gas two days a week after school at the Flying Horse service station on the corner of Peterson and Western . This was during the winter when he was sixteen . The three other weekday afternoons , and also on Saturdays , he worked at the Red Hot Ranch , a hot dog and hamburger joint . Roy had taken the gas station job in addition to his long-standing employment at the Ranch because his mother had had her hours reduced as a receptionist at Winnemac Hospital . His sister had just begun grammar school and they needed the money . Roy knew that his mother was considering getting married again -- for what would be the fourth time -- as a way to support them , a move he wanted desperately to avert or , at the least , delay . None of his mother 's marriages had been successful , as even she would admit , other than two of them having produced Roy and his little sister . They were her treasures , she assured them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile . <p> Domingo and Damaso Parlanchn , two Puerto Rican brothers , owned the Flying Horse . They were good mechanics , originally from San Juan , who had worked for other people for fifteen years and saved their money so that they could buy their own station . They were short , chubby , good-humored men in their forties , constantly chattering to each other in rapid Spanish . The Parlanchn brothers paid Roy a dollar an hour and fifty cents for each tire he changed , half of what it cost the customer . Damaso could patch a flat faster than Roy could get it off the car and back on again , and do it without missing a beat in the running conversation with his brother . Domingo was the better mechanic of the two , the more analytically adept . Damaso was superior at handling the customers , able to convince them they needed an oil change or an upgrade of their tires . <p> It was no fun changing tires in January in Chicago . The temperature often fell well below zero degrees Fahrenheit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles and cut fingers . Prying loose frozen lug nuts was Roy 's greatest difficulty , until Domingo showed him how to use an acetylene torch to heat the bolts before attempting to turn them with a tire iron . " Cuidado con la lanzallamas , " Domingo told Roy . <p> One snowy afternoon about a quarter to four , just before dark , a black-and-white Buick Century ka-bumped into the station on its rims and stopped . All four tires were flat . Roy could see that they were studded with nails . Two burly men in dark blue overcoats and Homburg hats sat in the front seat . They did not get out , so Roy went over to the driver 's side window and nodded at him . The man rolled down the window . He was about forty-five years old , had a three-day beard and a four inch-long scar across the left side of his lips . The man in the passenger seat looked just like the driver , except for the scar . <p> " How fast fix ? " asked the driver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " said Roy . <p> " Not possible fix ? " <p> " I 'll ask my boss , but I doubt it . You 're riding on your rims . We 'll have to check if they 're bent . " <p> " Go ask boss . " <p> Roy trudged through the thick , wet snow to the garage , where Domingo and Damaso were working over a transmission on a 1956 Ford Apache pickup . <p> " There 's a guy here who needs four tires replaced . Looks like he drove over a bed of nails . " <p> " Tell him he can to leave it , " said Damaso . <p> " And coming back at Mete horas , " Domingo added . <p> The wind ripped into Roy 's face when he removed his muffler from around his mouth to convey this information to the driver of the Buick . Roy 's eyes stung ; they watered as he waited for the man to respond . <p> " Can not they fix now ? " <p> " No , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The driver spoke to his companion in a language Roy could not readily identify . The wind whined and shrieked , making it difficult for Roy to hear anything else . <p> " We wait , " the driver told him . " Can fix sooner . " <p> Roy shook his head . " Maybe you 'd better try another station . But you 'll damage your wheels . " <p> The man produced a fifty dollar bill and shoved it at Roy . He held it between two black leather-gloved fingers . " This extra . Okey dokey ? " he said . " You give boss . " <p> Roy accepted the bill , marched back to the garage and handed it to Domingo . <p> " The guy says this is on top of the cost of replacing the tires , if we can do it now . " <p> " Tell him drive in muy despacio , " said Domingo . <p> After the man had done this , following Damaso 's signals to pull up into the other bay and onto the lift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We stay in , " said the driver . <p> " No es posible raise car with you inside . Insurance no good if you fall . " <p> The driver held out another fifty . Damaso took it . He nodded to Domingo , who activated the lift . <p> " Lock doors ! " Damaso shouted up at the men . " And no move ! " <p> Roy pumped gas for several customers while the Parlanchn brothers worked on the Buick . The sky had gone dark and snow kept falling . Before the Buick pulled out of the station on four new Bridgestones , it stopped next to Roy . The driver rolled down his window . <p> " Yes , sir ? " said Roy . " Is everything okay ? " <p> " All okey dokey , " replied the driver . " You young boy , work hard bad weather . How much Spanish men pay you ? " <p> " Buck an hour and two bits a flat . " <p> " Slave wage , " said the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended toward Roy his black gloved left hand between two fingers of which protruded another fifty-dollar bill . Roy took the money and stuffed it into one of the snap pockets of his brown leather jacket . <p> " Thank you , " he said . " Where are you guys from ? " <p> " You know Iron Curtain ? " <p> " I 've heard of it . " <p> " We are from behind . " <p> After the Buick had gone , Roy went into the garage . <p> " Strange hombres , si ? " said Domingo . <p> " The driver gave me a tip , " Roy told him . " I do n't know why , though . " <p> " He give us a hundred extra , " said Damaso . <p> " The Buick had diplomatic license plates , " Roy said . " They 're Russians , I think . " <p> " Must be they are trying to be more friendly , " Domingo suggested , " since they been forced to take missiles out of Cuba . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had had a boyfriend from Havana , a conga drummer named Raul Repilado . She had met him in Coral Gables , Florida , when she and her third husband , Sid Wade , the father of Roy 's sister , were vacationing at the Biltmore . Raul Repilado 's band , the Orquesta Furioso , was appearing at the hotel . Raul had come to Chicago a couple of times to see Roy 's mother , the last time during the winter . Before leaving , the conguero declared that he would never come back to such a terribly cold place , even for a beautiful woman . Roy could n't wait to tell his mother that he 'd made an extra fifty bucks that day . <p> By Barry Gifford <p> 
##4020269 Section : Up Front ABSTINENCE-ONLY ABSURDITY GLOBAL SEX/PRESS FREEDOM/THE RISE OF UNCERTAINTY SEEN AND HEARD ALLIANCE OF CIVILIZATIONS REPORT CLASSIC HUMANIST <p> IN LATE OCTOBER 2006 New Jersey became the fourth state to reject federal funding for sex education programs . -hanks to Bush administration mandates , accepting the federal money would have required the state to abandon its existing comprehensive sex-ed curriculum , and instead rely exclusively on abstinence-only programs . But though New Jersey 's decision and similar ones by California , Connecticut , and Maine are encouraging , not every state has the luxury of turning down federal dollars . And that 's bad news for those concerned about reproductive health . <p> While the U.S. government will spend over $241 million in federal funding on abstinence-only programs in 2007 , there 's good reason to doubt the effectiveness of the Bush administration 's preferred approach . A recent General Accountability Office study concluded that abstinence-only programs suffer from a lack of oversight and found little evidence that they succeed at preventing teen pregnancy . Another study , released in 2004 by Rep. Henry Waxman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstinence-only curricula supported by the Department of Health &; Human Services ( HHS ) contained false , misleading , or distorted information about abortion , contraception , and gender roles , and routinely presented religious beliefs as scientific fact . The results of the Bush administration 's promotion of abstinence-only curricula speak for themselves : the nation 's teen birth rate , teen pregnancy rate , and abortion rate all remain the highest in the industrialized world . <p> A closer look at the abstinence-only programs that have received federal funding suggests further cause for concern . In 2004 the HHS Capital Compassion Fund announced over $58 million in grants to " grass-roots , faith-based " organizations , including groups like Catholic Charities of Kansas City and Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska . Among the many examples of abstinence-only programs being run with federal dollars by groups with explicitly religious missions is the Silver Ring Thing ( SRT ) . SRT -- which urges teens to pledge to refrain from sex until marriage and to make a public show of their commitment by wearing a symbolic silver ring -- is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , the John Guest Evangelistic Team , works , according to its website , " to communicate the message of Jesus Christ to the unchurched through creative , media-based and one-on-one evangelism . " <p> A review of other abstinence-only sex-ed programs only further reinforces the religious undertones being utilized in public schools . The Why kNOw ? program directly paraphrases 1 Corinthians 13:4 to describe the true meaning of love : " Real Love is patient ; is kind ; does not envy ; does not boast ; is not proud ; is not rude ; is not self-seeking ; is not easily angered ; keeps no record of wrongs ; does not delight in evil ; rejoices with the truth ; always protects ; always trusts ; always hopes ; always lasts ; and never fails . " Why kNOw ? also quotes the Song of Songs as a " historical book " and states that " though the origin of the name ' French Kissing ' is unknown , King Solomon should take credit for the act . " The curriculum also places heavy emphasis on studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students plan their own weddings , complete with details on which flowers they would use , who would be in their bridal party , and , of course , which ( heterosexual , virginal ) person they would wed . The program teaches youth that the traditional lifting of the veil shows that " the groom is the only man allowed to ' uncover ' the bride , " and demonstrates her respect for him by illustrating that she has n't " allowed any other man to lay claim to her . " <p> Promoting marriage and discouraging premarital sex through fear and false information remains a benchmark of abstinence-only sex education . The Heritage Keepers program repeatedly cites research suggesting that married people have better sex -- and many of these statistics are attributed to Glenn T. Stanton , director of global insight for cultural and family renewal and senior analyst of marriage and sexuality at Focus on the Family . <p> The WAIT ( Why Am I Tempted ? ) Training program also depends heavily on moralistic , pro-marriage information to promote abstinence . The WAIT curriculum includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , symbolizing a woman , on a man 's arm to show that after several " uses " ( sexual acts or partners ) the tape is less clean and perfect . Finally , the teacher is instructed to attach the tape to another male volunteer and ask , " If this process gets repeated too many times , do you think it will affect this person 's marriage ? " <p> Such games are n't unique . Why kNOw ? includes a game that compares a stuffed animal named " Speedy the Sperm , " which represents a sperm cell , and a penny , used to symbolize HIV . By this reasoning , students are meant to see that if a condom fails 14 percent of the time with something as big as Speedy , it clearly can not effectively prevent the spread of HIV -- which is a thousandth of the size . Despite repeated and conclusive evidence showing that condoms available in the United States do n't have holes ( if they do , the entire batch is discarded ) , and that the real reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why kNOw ? continues to teach youth that condoms are useless , apparently believing that this will discourage them from having sex . Predictably , research suggests that young people who believe condoms do n't work simply use protection less often -- they do n't engage in sex at a lesser rate . <p> Clearly , we do our young people a great disservice by continuing to use such misleading and dangerous curricula . The Bush administration 's reliance on abstinence-only sex ed confronts advocates of a more comprehensive ( and effective ) approach with a strategic challenge : How can we promote healthy sex education without being viewed as morally deficient ? Like it or not , many parents remain anxious that comprehensive sex ed takes what they view as one of their most sensitive parenting tasks out of their hands , and puts it into those of teachers and administrators whom they may not trust . Even the most widely effective and highly promoted comprehensive sex-ed programs , such as " Making Proud Choices " and " Draw the Line/Respect the Line , " still include decision-making skills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach their children themselves . Public health educators must find a way to maintain or at least respect parental control and personal choice while stressing the need to provide effective factual information to teens . <p> By Heidi Bruggink <p> <p> Heidi Bruggink holds a B.A. from Harvard University and is the legal coordinator for the Appignani Humanist Legal Center in Washington DC . <p> 
##4020270 THE UNITED NATION 'S HIGH-LEVEL Group for the Alliance of Civilizations recently issued its final report , which included ambitious and important recommendations to bridge the divide between Western nations and the Muslim world . The group 's twenty eminent members were brought together by Secretary General Kofi Annan and included the former president of Iran , Seyed Mohamed Khatami ; Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; and Andr ' Azoulay , advisor to King Mohammed VI of Morocco . <p> The recommendations of the High Level Group form a holistic approach to alleviating global inequalities and bridging the Western-Islamic rift . Recommendations include : education that expands a sense of a common humanity , media literacy skills , and empowering initiatives directed towards youth and other groups ; international exchanges with diverse participation ; measures that address the challenges of migration ; and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , " the urgency of which can hardly be overstated . " ( The report also notes that without a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , the horrible violence in Iraq , and intensifying violence in Afghanistan , efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only limited success . " ) <p> The Alliance report describes-highly progressive measures involving education and youth . In essence , the measures fully support the pursuit and understanding of one 's own religious , ethnic , and national identity , coupled with knowledge and respect for cultural diversity in the world . To achieve this balance , a range of initiatives and programs are suggested . For example , multipolar perspectives at universities and research centers are encouraged , including courses such as " world history " and " history of humanity " Also , just as the Millennium Development Goals call for , the report strongly recommends expanding access to education , particularly in developing countries and for girls who , more often than boys , are pulled out of school due to factors of poverty . <p> The Alliance group additionally suggests that service-learning programs should be connected whenever possible to degree and certificate programs . Pedagogically , we know that most of us learn by doing , and service learning allows people to thoughtfully address serious social challenges that afflict communities . Such programs have been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the communities that benefit . The experiences can be transformative for youth , giving them a better sense of what they wish to dedicate themselves to in the future and opening them up to the lives and trials of other people . For communities , service-learning programs are often the catalyst for positive and collaborative social action . <p> This leads to another important recommendation in the report , which is to involve our youth in decision-making processes in " community councils , youth organizations and governing bodies of civil society organizations and institutions " The report states that , " youth unemployment is two to three times greater than national unemployment levels worldwide . " The economic participation of youth involves teens beginning to work part-time and during summers to have the opportunity to develop practical skills that can enhance their futures . School-based career guidance and assistance to youth enterprises , for example , can help promote youth employment . Globally , the Middle East and North African region have the lowest rate of youth employment ( 40 percent versus 54 percent worldwide ) . There is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their communities so they can express their innovative and helpful ideas and develop the means to achieve them . In essence , young people need to feel a real stake in their communities so that they can be productive contributors and partners in the Alliance of Civilizations , and incorporating them in decision-making processes is necessary for this to be achieved . <p> I suggest that the participation of local communities , including youth , in the identification and management of development projects throughout the Muslim world , which is an approach consistent with the Millennium Development Goals and the recommendation of the Alliance , will significantly decrease the divide with the West . Participation in community development involves all members of villages , neighborhoods , and regions , who together define their priorities for projects ( in education , health , economic development , environment , and other areas ) and a plan of action to achieve them . <p> Participatory activities are often utilized to help local people analyze and discuss their social conditions from a range of perspectives as part of the decision-making process for projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of citizens working towards social change in their community engaged in a series of development planning activities that incorporated the use of visuals , charts , and mapping . They determined that a community center for their youth was the most important goal and are currently taking important steps toward its construction . In the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco , local communities most often rank potable water , irrigation , and projects for women and youth to be among the top development priorities . <p> Participation in community development responds directly to the " guiding principles " expressed in the Alliance report : " Poverty leads to despair , a sense of injustice , and alienation that , when combined with political grievances , can foster extremism . Eradication of poverty would diminish those factors linked to economic marginalization and alienation and must therefore be aggressively pursued . " Communities planning local development in a participatory way base projects on the self-described interests of the local people , which works against alienation . The fact that communities determine and have ownership of the projects provides the basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmental benefits in extremely diverse contexts . <p> The participatory approach likewise takes the form of democratic governance that the Alliance encourages : " To be successful , democratic systems must emerge organically from within each society 's culture , reflecting its shared values and adapted to the needs and interests of its citizens . This is only possible when people are free and feel in control of their destiny ? ' The participatory process is democracy that emerges from within because it grows from dialogue and interaction among local community members and is driven by their own needs and interests . <p> Participatory community development also relates to observations in the report of the impact of the international system on diverse nations and cultures , as well as internal factors in Muslim societies that inhibit development . Many feel , the report states , that the " international system offers greater conformity and homogenization of cultures , complete with the dislocation of families and communities brought about by urbanization , the negation or appropriation of traditional lifestyles , and environmental degradation . " We have learned from experiences around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uneven effects of globalization is diversification of production and income . Diversification requires new development projects and building decision-making skills of people and communities to better enable them to adapt to changing conditions . Participatory activities help people base their decisions on a range of perspectives and information , leading to development projects that are thoughtfully designed and expand the ways human needs are satisfied . <p> The Alliance report contends that , " all Muslim societies would benefit from increased dialogue and debate to identify those factors internal to their own societies which have inhibited their development and full integration into global political , economic , and intellectual communities , and to generate ideas on how to overcome these barriers . " Participatory development can help in this regard because as community members determine priority projects , they analyze social , economic , environmental , historical , technical , and institutional factors that affect their lives and prospective projects . Not only does this analysis and dialogue further public understanding of internal barriers , but is in itself an indigenous democratic reform process that helps to overcome those barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stresses civic and human rights education and a movement away from thinking in exclusive terms . Participation in community development advances this kind of education for diverse communities as they create and pursue a common agenda for social development and change . If facilitated throughout the Muslim world , its effect can be a true alliance of civilizations . Seen and Heard <p> " This book IS for corporate America . " -E.O .

##4021962 It is essential for graphic designers , especially high school technology education students , to understand why and how to effectively transform data into graphics to both engage the viewer and communicate information.Introduction Design is a hot area in communications technology , but can students effectively communicate the graphic design they create ? In particular , learning to communicate through graphic representations is essential for technology education students . Jacques Bertin ( 1983 ) argued the case that graphics , through scientific visualization and information design , can be a powerful communication tool . Graphic communication falls into its own area , separate from mathematics , musical , and verbal communications . Understanding the nature of graphic communication--a form of communication that is both atemporal and spatial--forms one of the key foundations for communicating scientific and technical information . It is essential for graphic designers , especially high school technology education students , to understand why and how to effectively transform data into graphics to both engage the viewer and communicate information . Communication technology is an important area in technology education when preparing students for twenty-first century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of communications means learners know how to create , print , and present graphics . A crucial part of this process is effectively encoding information in a graphic form . Understanding how cognitive and perceptual processes influence how we interpret graphics is a part of this literacy . Being aware of the cognitive principles underlying visual perception is beneficial to students when designing graphics ( Haber &; Wilkinson , 1982 ) . Visual perception has a close relation to human memory and establishment of association . The cognitive architectures and processes that determine levels of association of how information is managed by the brain are important . The mind is neither a camera nor a computer , and visual perceptual knowledge is a valuable source of information to strengthen design . One of the important findings from cognitive and perceptual research is how we process and understand color . Three color models are most commonly used in the production of graphics : red , green , blue ( RGB ) ; cyan , magenta , yellow , and black ( CMYK ) ; and hue , saturation , and value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color model that comes closest to mimicking how humans perceive color . A ninth grade student comparing HSV to the other color systems is likely to say it 's easier to know what the end result of a color change will be when using this model . The VisTE project at North Carolina State University ( Clark &; Wiebe , 2005 ; Wiebe , et al. , 2006 , 2007 ) has focused on creating units for middle and high school students that use graphics to communicate concepts in math , science , and technology . This project used Standards for Technological Literacy ( STL ) ( ITEA , 2000/2002/2007 ) as a guide to develop activities that helped students learn how to effectively communicate with graphics . A number of the VisTE activities focus on understanding how to effectively use color models like hue , saturation , and value ( HSV ) . Comparing properties of color through various color models and how graphic communication problems can be solved through color helps teach students to look beneath the surface of a graphic and strengthen their skills in communications . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Standard 10 . Students will develop an understanding of the role of troubleshooting , research and development , invention and innovation , and experimentation in problem solving . -- Standard 17 . Students will develop an understanding of and be able to select and use information and communication technologies . That is , students will engage their knowledge of the cognitive and perceptual properties of color and the technology used to produce color graphics to problem-solve ways of communicating information graphically . The following example project extends these principles and looks at how color knowledge can be developed in the communications technology classroom.Project Overview A student once commented upon completion of a project that what was seen on the screen was not what he saw on the printed page : " Everything changed . " What happened ? Students often discuss how the colors on the screen are not always what appear on paper . What does this mean ? Are n't the colors on the screen the same as the colors from the printer ? What would cause a difference ? Color is a very important part of design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class is essential to communicate true images and products . Color is a powerful element that " can draw attention and produce a strong emotional and psychological impact , " ( Prust , 1999 ) . In this activity , students are going to learn how to generate a consistent image throughout the production process . Assessing the image from the monitor to the printer is key to learning how to effectively communicate the intended message . To accomplish this task , establishing a basic understanding of calibrating color through visual perception is needed . Part of this process is understanding " the difference between various color systems . " As Armstrong ( 2004 ) states , " Monitors , scanners , digital cameras , etc. deal in visible light , " RGB ( red , green , and blue ) , and should not to be confused with the standard primary colors : red , yellow , and blue . RGB color is called additive because it is created by adding varying intensities of red , green , and blue light to black ( on a computer screen this equals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary from 255 ( full intensity ) to 0 . If each color channel has 256 variations of red , green , and blue , then over 16 million different colors are possible from these combinations . This range of possible colors comes close to describing all possible visible light colors . In fact , most RGB color-generating technologies ( e.g. , computer monitors ) can only display a subset of these colors , called a color gamut . Printing , on the other hand , deals in light reflected off of or through inks , which creates a narrower color gamut . CMYK colors are secondary , opposite colors of RGB . Cyan absorbs red light , magenta absorbs green light , yellow absorbs blue light , and black ( K ) controls the overall level of light absorption . The degree of absorption varies on the amount of CMYK colors that are visible . CMYK is known as subtractive because the colors displayed are the result of subtracting varying amounts of red , green , and blue light . The range for RGB is a bit different than CMYK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible light color gamut . In addition , the conversion from RGB color to CMYK color and vice versa is not exact . This is because neither color system is based directly on how humans perceive color . This information brings about the question , " How does one get the version of the image from the monitor and the one from the printer to match ? " The answer is plain and simple : iterative adjustment . Within the realm of colors is another system of color commonly seen in a graphics software color picker ( method for choosing image color using a tool that looks like an eye dropper ) : HSV . HSV ( hue , saturation , and value ) is the system that comes closest to how we " see " and compare colors . One freshman student alluded in a class conversation that it is an easier model to understand because one can compare and relate to it ; the colors are true to how he sees them . Hue is the rainbow aspect of color , explaining where a specific color lies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle where the starting and ending color is red . Red is at 0 degrees , yellow is at 60 degrees clockwise with green , cyan , blue , magenta , and red again . Saturation describes how pure a color is . If a color seems to have no gray in it , then it is said to be highly saturated . The more gray present in a color , the less saturated it is . The value goes from 0 , neutral , straight gray color , to 100 , strong , pure color . Value is brightness , lightness , or intensity--in other words , how much light is coming from the color.Description of Lesson At our high school , students learn about visual perception and the changes between RGB , CMYK , and HSV color systems through a series of lessons leading up to a cumulative project . Students use the lessons to gain an understanding of color calibration ( refining colors to be true between monitor and printer ) and visual perception and to apply these lessons to a final project . Students are first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at monitor and printer images . Students discuss the meaning of HSV and use it to describe the differences between colors on screen versus the printed versions . For the final project , students begin by scanning a headshot photograph . Once the image is scanned , students place the image into an illustration program and begin working . Using various tools in the program , students create a two-dimensional , vector-based image similar to the underlying photograph . Rather than having a bitmap image where every pixel is a different color , the vector-based illustration program creates regions of solid color . This process is often called posterization and requires students to visually interpret the color they are seeing in a region in the photograph and pick a single color that represents the collective perception of this region of pixels . Posterization is , in a way , a scaffolding technique that limits the number of colors and regions in the graphic that the student needs to analyze . Therefore , the student is able to focus on both the essential characteristics of a single color , comparisons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective impact of all of the colors in the image or region . When done , students print a first draft of their re-creation of the photo . The next step is to adjust colors with the HSV color model . Using the HSV scale to adjust color is an efficient way of managing colors for the projects in this class . The colors used in HSV can be clearly defined by human perception , which is not always the case with RGB or CMYK . Matching and sharing colors can easily be done in most medium to high-end graphics software packages . When working with the illustration software , the knowledge of color calibration is invaluable . The instructor needs to show students how to use bars of color , known as test strips , in the margins when experimenting with colors . These test strips represent systematic shifts in hue , saturation , value , or a combination of these scales . They provide benchmarks against which students can adjust their colors . A test strip allows the user to more easily see variations in hue , saturation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of colors quickly ( like a paint swatch or package of crayons ) without needing to continually print to achieve the perfect color . Test strips leverage perceptual and cognitive limitations of human vision by presenting groups of color simultaneously in the field of view . In this way one does n't have to hold a color in memory and compare it to a different color at some later point in time . It also does n't require an individual to mentally transform a color from a numeric value in a color model specification dialogue box into a visual image of the color . By systematically making single adjustments , like hue only , students can focus on the perceptual impact of small shifts in color and understand the differential effects of shifting each of the three different qualities of color : hue , saturation , and value . By and large , this process is the most direct way for students to be able to effectively communicate using the language of color.Assessment Assessments are done informally and formally throughout the entire lesson . Informal assessment through observation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material . Peer , self , and teacher observations are used in the lesson . Peer evaluation is done almost daily through casual conversation and questioning . Students are to casually ask each other questions , such as how to use a tool or opinions on the look of an object . Teacher observations are also used to evaluate student progression . Walking around the room and being easily accessible creates a comfortable learning environment . Deadlines are another informal type of assessment as students are asked to print what is currently on the screen . Deadlines allow student designers and instructors to see the status of a project . Formal assessments are more detailed and typically involve a grade . For this lesson , printing the portrait project created in the illustration software generates an artifact for formal assessment .

Students build upon their cumulative knowledge and previous experience to develop their ability to describe , interpret , evaluate , respond , and produce . Learning the HSV color system along with the use of color strips is an effective and informative problem-solving method to make iterative adjustments to color when working on graphic communication projects . By the end of this lesson , students are expected to understand the relationship between the three components of the HSV color model in order to accurately calibrate color , produce test strips , and create a final product .

##4022051 Dropsy is an old word for an older problem . Afflicted , you begin to swell--first your ankles , then your legs . Walking gets difficult , even sitting becomes painful . Then the swelling gets so bad your skin splits open . The commonest cause is heart failure . Think of the revolving door of an office building . As the door gets older it turns more slowly . Eventually people have to queue , spilling out onto the street . As your heart gets feebler , your blood queues up in the same way . Under that pressure , your veins leak fluid , which builds up between cells , pooling wherever gravity directs . Because we have a double circulation system , there 's a double problem . Unable to get into a weakly pumping right ventricle , ready to go to the lungs , deoxygenated blood backs up in your extremities , and fluid collects in your tissues . You swell from the feet upwards . And instead of being pumped out to the body from your left ventricle , oxygenated blood backs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spaces where air should be . You get breathless . Doctors used to try to relieve dropsy , which today we call edema , by making holes in people 's bloated legs to let the fluid out . That could help , a little . Anything that reduced the amount of fluid in your body , even leeches and bloodletting , could make you feel better . Welcome to the world of medicine that Dr. William Withering knew in the late eighteenth century , a scintillatingly brilliant time that crackled with new discoveries , political revolutions , and the excitement generated by the birth of the Enlightenment . Yet Withering lacked the charisma of his era . He was raised in a medical family in Shropshire , England , in 1741 , and after four years ' apprenticeship to a local physician , he went to Edinburgh to get his degree . There were the typical diversions : he golfed , published bad poetry , and learned to play the bagpipes . He loathed , in particular , the botany he was forced to study . Nevertheless , he completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hospitals around Europe . Unfortunately , Withering 's trip ended early . His traveling companion , a healthy young man of his own age , developed a skin infection in Paris . " An abscess grew upon his shoulder , a fever came on , the wound gangren 'd and yesterday he died , " wrote Withering , who lived in a time when death came suddenly and doctors were impotent . IN 1767 WITHERING began to practice . One of his first patients was seventeen-year-old Helena Cooke . She liked drawing flowers . While she lay sick in bed , Withering scoured the countryside to find her fresh subjects , apparently moved by her charms to overcome his antipathy toward botany . It turned out to be the start of two lifelong relationships : Withering married his patient and acquired a lasting fondness for plants . In 1775 worldly opportunity called on the young couple , arriving in the overwhelming shape of Erasmus Darwin , pockmarked , rotten-toothed , and enormous . He had as great an appetite for food and free love as for science and verse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poetry about the sex lives of plants , he is best known these days for his grandson Charles . ) Darwin recognized the young Withering 's intellect and helped him secure the position of town physician for Birmingham . Combined with Darwin 's friendship , the post brought membership in a remarkable club : the Lunar Society , named for its habit of meeting at full moons to make traveling home safer . The Lunaticks , as they called themselves , men like Matthew Boulton , Joseph Priestley , and Josiah Wedgwood , were the leading British scientists and entrepreneurs of the day . While his friends manufactured Britain 's industrial revolution , Withering lived conservatively . His son described him as methodical , known more for " steady sense and correct judgement than for the flights of fancy or the eccentricities of genius . " His letters are fabulously dreary . But for all his lack of glitter , Withering was sharply observant . When his opportunity for major discovery came , he jumped : Engraving of Dr. William Withering made in 1801 , two years after his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning a family receipt for the cure of the dropsy . I was told that it had long been kept a secret by an old woman in Shropshire , who had sometimes made cures after the more regular practitioners had failed . This medicine was composed of twenty or more different herbs ; but it was not very difficult for one conversant in these subjects to perceive that the active herb could be no other than the Foxglove . ANY OF SOME TWENTY PLANTS in the genus Digitalis , foxglove had been used as a medicine by hosts of people , from ancient Greeks to medieval Welsh . During the Middle Ages in Western Europe , it was believed to cure a whole range of diseases for which it is actually useless . In the mid-1600s , for example , the herbalist Nicholas Culpeper recommended foxglove for treating epilepsy . It does n't . Foxglove . also had obvious problems . In the sixteenth century , a botanically misguided Dutch chef fed his guests a foxglove omelette . Their consequent diarrhea and vomiting were a good demonstration of the plant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you die . In the seventeenth century , forty years before Withering , a Frenchman investigated foxglove 's effects on a turkey . " He did not attempt to perch , " ran his poignant report on the poultry , " he uttered plaintive cries . " The bird stumbled drunkenly for a few days , refused to eat , and died . At medical school I was taught the blunt truth that only inactive drugs are without side effects . Taking a pill is like thumping the side of a misbehaving television : you might bang the right piece into place , but you might make things worse . Withering knew this ( minus the television analogy ) , worrying that " the lives of men " could be " hazarded " by his new drug . His understanding of medical science evoked the modernity of the Lunar Society . It was not enough , he realized , to compile only encouraging stories . It would have been an easy task to have given select cases , whose successful treatment would have spoken strongly in favour of the medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth and Science would condemn the procedure . I have therefore mentioned every case in which I have prescribed the Foxglove , proper or improper , successful or otherwise . Altogether Withering wrote up 163 cases of dropsy in which he used the plant , and the majority of those patients ( no doubt the ones whose dropsy was caused by heart failure ) got better . Swollen legs reduced in size , breathing was eased . Noting that patients produced copious amounts of urine as they began to improve , Withering suspected that digitalis extract worked as a diuretic , causing excess fluid to be lost as urine and so reducing the amount of work the heart needed to do . " It charms the shape less monster into man , " Erasmus Darwin wrote in his poem about it . Praise even came from the other side of the world : a physician from New Hampshire wrote congratulating Withering and asking for help in seeding the flower in America . In 1790 , with the Revolution raging in France , Withering diagnosed himself with tuberculosis . Over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend was struck by how weak he became : " The flower of English physicians is indeed withering . " ( Medicine has progressed over the centuries , but puns are as bad as ever . ) In October 1799 he died . His memorial tablet was carved with a plant of the genus Witheringia on one side and , separated by a terrifically bad poem , a foxglove on the other . Hand-colored illustration of a foxglove species , Digitalis purpurea , drawn by James Sowerby . It appeared in the six-volume collection Flora Londinensis , published in the/ate eighteenth century--around the time of Withering 's experiments with foxglove as a human drug . HEARTS ARE WELL EVOLVED , but not miraculous . That means compromise and ultimate failure . Let 's say that you hope to manufacture something with a lifetime guarantee , a watch , for example ; you would engineer it to last a hundred-odd years , not a thousand . Evolution is equally careful about not wasting resources . Therefore no body part outlasts the rest , or not by much . Even our solid skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine follows a similar aim , hoping to keep any organ from failing too far ahead of the rest , thus extending our healthy lives and compressing our decay into the fewest possible days . The heart , however , often proves difficult to save , as muscle cells do n't divide--at least , not abundantly enough to regenerate healthy tissue . If you exercise them , heart muscle cells might get bigger , but few or no new ones will be made . So as you age , they can die off gradually--particularly under the stress of high blood pressure , diabetes , or coronary artery disease--or , in the case of a heart attack , die off suddenly and potentially catastrophically . Either way , the heart never grows back . Foxglove--or digitalis , as the pharmaceutical compounds derived from it are commonly called--works not by directly causing increased urination , as Withering thought , but by making the heart beat more strongly and efficiently . The trouble is , drugs that increase the strength of the heart 's beats do n't make it grow new muscle ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any coach will tell you that if you push any athlete too far , you risk collapse . When an aging heart fails and begins to pump less blood , our bodies make a mistake . They notice the reduced flow , but presume we 're bleeding or dehydrated . Evolutionarily , surviving blood loss and dehydration is more critical than extending old age . So , when the body detects a lack of blood flow , it assumes that a lack of blood is to blame . In response we get thirsty and our kidneys reduce urine output . By drinking more and peeing less , our bodies compensate for a loss of fluid that has not occurred--as a result , we end up with too much . Having to pump more fluid is exactly what a failing heart needs least . Withering correctly observed that digitalis made people feel better , yet could it have been killing them just the same ? Neither Withering nor anyone long after him took a systematic look . In 1997 , nearly two centuries after Withering 's death , a medical trial came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated to digitalis or a placebo for more than three years . The results : for every thirty-nine people taking digitalis for a year , one avoided a hospital admission . The effect on mortality ? Zero . Digitalis is neither the lifesaver people had imagined nor the killer some suspected . IT HAS TAKEN TWO CENTURIES TO go from hailing digitalis as a miracle cure to wondering if using it makes any sense at all . Some doctors feel that the harms are hardly worth the benefits . Others continue to prescribe it liberally , as though it really is a lifesaver . Yet for certain patients , digitalis remains modestly effective , making them feel and function better than any razzle-dazzle new synthetic drug . And that , even if they do n't live longer , is no small thing . Dropsy Courting Consumption is the title that artist Thomas Rowlandson gave to this illustration , published in 1810 .

##4022179 The downfall of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago gave mammals an incredible opening , and they ran for it , rapidly becoming the dominant land vertebrates . Among those to emerge were the earliest carnivorans ( members of the order Carnivora ) , whose living representatives include the cats and closely allied families , such as hyenas and mongooses , as well as dogs and closely allied families , such as bears , weasels , and seals . As their name implies , most carnivorans eat meat , and even those that are n't carnivorous--such as the giant panda--can be recognized by the last upper premolar and first lower molar on each side of the mouth . Those teeth are specially adapted for shearing , and are known as carnassials . Only in some species , such as seals and sea lions , have the carnassials evolved into simpler forms . Back when mammals got their big break--during the Paleocene epoch , which lasted ten million years--conditions around the globe were warm and humid . And the epoch that followed , the Eocene , was marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite hospitable to life . Surging into prominence , flowering plants diversified and created lush forests all over the Earth . In North America , where tree canopies sheltered a growing number of primates and other forest-dwelling mammals , the earliest carnivorans arose . From there they spread to Eurasia , over land bridges that then existed to Europe or near the present-day Bering Strait . Mostly the size of small foxes , or smaller , the carnivorans were adapted to life in and around trees , probably preying on invertebrates and small vertebrates . They lived in the shadow of the generally much larger hyaenodonts , a group of mammalian predators that had come on the scene earlier but which later became extinct . When did the carnivorans split into their catlike and doglike divisions ? No one knows exactly ; it may have been 50 million years ago or even earlier . By 40 million years ago , however , the first clearly identifiable member of the dog family itself , the Canidae , had arisen in what is now southwestern Texas . Named Prohesperocyon wilsoni , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a canid . Fittingly enough , these include features of the teeth--including the loss of the upper third molars , part of a general trend toward a more shearing bite--along with a characteristically enlarged bony bulla , the rounded covering over the middle ear . Based on what we know about its descendants , Prohesperocyon likely had slightly more elongated limbs than its predecessors , along with toes that were parallel and closely touching , rather than splayed , as in bears . In an artist 's reconstruction of a savanna in western North America about 15 million years ago , a pack of Aelurodon ferox ( in the canid subfamily Borophaginae ) pursues a three-toed horse of the genus Neohipparion . In such an open landscape , both predator and prey were driven to evolve stamina and speed . The dog family thrived on such limb adaptations , which helped support a cursorial , or running , lifestyle in response to a changing environment . And none too soon , for the subsequent epoch , the Oligocene , between 34 million and 23 million years ago , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Antarctic continent for the first time , while in mid-latitude North America , conditions became progressively dryer and seasonal variations more pronounced . The lush , moist forests of the late Eocene gave way to dry woodlands and then to wooded grasslands , with large areas of open grassland developing by 30 million years ago . Mammalian herbivores began to evolve teeth adapted to eating grass ( so-called high-crowned teeth , which continue to erupt as the chewing surfaces are worn down ) . For both predators and prey , the ability to run and survive in an open , exposed landscape became crucial . To a large extent , the history of the dog family is a story of how a group of cursorial predators evolved , through speed and intelligence , to catch changing prey in a changing landscape . The canids are one of three modern families of carnivorans notable for including top predators , species capable of hunting down prey several times their own size . The other two are the cat family ( the felids ) and the hyena family ( the hyaenids ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a body-size threshold of around forty-five pounds beyond which a mammalian predator must begin to tackle larger prey in order to get enough energy . Chris Carbone , a senior research fellow in biodiversity and macroecology , and colleagues at the Institute of Zoology , the research division of the Zoological Society of London , have suggested that small predators can sustain themselves on invertebrates and small vertebrates because of their low absolute energy requirements . Soon after its beginnings 40 million years ago , the dog family ( Canidae ) diverged into three main subfamilies , each of which dominated in turn . The figure illustrates major branching points , with the width of each lineage representing its species diversity through time . All three subfamilies coexisted for a long time . Two ( the Hesperocyoninae and the Borophaginae ) became extinct in turn , but the Caninae , with thirty-six species , is going strong . ( Portraits of the selected species shown above are not drawn to the same scale . ) In 1871 , pioneer vertebrate paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope formulated the principle that in animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes . With the help of our colleagues Blaire Van Valkenburgh , a functional morphologist at the University of California at Los Angeles , and John Damuth , a biostatistician at the University of California , Santa Barbara , we have examined the canid fossil record with that idea in mind . We have concluded that , indeed , larger and larger species have repeatedly evolved in many lineages . Consequently , many species have independently passed the threshold where they needed to take down large prey . Features of their jaws and teeth show that the larger canid species have also tended to become hypercarnivorous , that is , more purely meat-eating . The cat family and the hyena family similarly evolved hypercarnivorous top predators . ( One might think the bear family , the ursids , should be added to this list , but only the polar bear is hypercarnivorous , and it is a rather atypical member of the family . Most bears are omnivores . ) It 's only a slight oversimplification to say that felids almost invariably approach their prey in stealth and try to pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , have a decidedly different tactic , one suited to their ancestors ' lifestyle on the open plains . In that setting , surprise attack is seldom achieved ; it is less important to subdue the prey in the shortest possible time than to outrun and exhaust the quarry . Lacking retractable claws , a powerful weapon for most felids , canids rely more on social hunting when sheer numbers and coordinated hunting strategies rather than sophisticated weaponry to overwhelm them . Hyaenids are more closely related to cats , yet they more strongly resemble canids , both behaviorally and anatomically . They kill their prey by consuming them alive , rather than by delivering a killing bite on the neck as felids do . They too are persistent pursuers rather than stalkers that ambush prey , and they tend to be highly social hunters . The similarities are a good example of convergent evolution , an understandable outcome when one realizes that for much of their evolutionary history , the two groups were not direct competitors but were facing similarly open environments . Canids were at first confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did canids become so diverse ? From Hesperocyon , a descendant of Prohesperocyon , the family experienced its initial radiation in tile early Oligocene , about 34 million years ago , splitting into three major subfamilies : the Hesperocyoninae and the Borophaginae ( both extinct lineages known only from fossils ) , and the Caninae , whose descendants survive today . But it is at first only among the hesperocyonines that we see some really dominant dogs , capable of hunting prey larger than themselves . They were the size of small wolves and equipped with teeth specialized for ripping into raw meat , comparable to those of modern African hunting dogs . The early borophagines , on the other hand , were all smaller and tended toward less predatory lifestyles . And biding its time was the Caninae subfamily , comprising only a few inconspicuous species ( we 'll avoid calling them " canines , " a term that is usually used in a narrower sense ) . A young adult Eucyon davisi , about the size of a living coyote , approaches one of its parents in a submissive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subfamily Caninae may have arisen when such youngsters remained in their parents ' territory and helped raise pups . The genus Eucyon lived in North America from about 9 million to 5 million years ago . Altogether , by about 30 million to 28 million years ago , twenty-five species of canids roamed western North America , a peak of diversity within a continent unequaled before or since by any single family of carnivoran . The dog family was making its mark . Meanwhile , the hyaenodonts and other archaic predators had begun to decline , and they were eventually overtaken by the successful carnivorans . North American herbivores , the potential prey for canids , steadily diversified during the first half of the following epoch , the Miocene , which lasted from 23 million to 5 million years ago . That was thanks not only to evolution but also to immigration of Eurasian native species via land bridges . The herbivores reached an all-time peak of diversity around 15 million years ago , and perhaps not coincidentally , canids experienced a second peak of diversity ( some twenty species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borophagines were the ones to flourish . The hesperocyonines were on the verge of extinction , while the Caninae continued to keep a low profile . Among the factors driving canid evolution was the increasing speed of the grazing herbivores , which in turn was a response to being preyed upon in open habitats . The well-known illustration of this process is how members of the horse family essentially came to run on the tips of their toes , evolving longer toe bones and eventually losing their lateral digits . Even though canids were getting faster , they also had to adjust to competition from new carnivoran immigrants , including members of the cat family ; false saber-tooth cats ( which were catlike but not true felids ) ; large mustelids ; and giant bear dogs ( family Amphicyonidae ) . Bone-cracking became a specialty of the new borophagine species that arose at the time , suggesting that they regularly scavenged carcasses--a kind of resource that is easier to locate in a more open environment . The ability to consume bones may have arisen as a byproduct of group feeding among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much food as quickly as possible , ate bone ( or swallowed meat plus bones indiscriminately ) . The Caninae lineage , present from the early Oligocene , finally made its big move during the late Miocene , as the open grasslands continued to expand . One distinctive feature of the subfamily , which had slender , elongated limbs , is that the front and hind big toes became progressively smaller , and ceased to be functional . This cursorial feature , not found in the other two canid subfamilies , became an advantage when the landscape opened up . By the late Miocene , early precursors of the modern " true " foxes ( tribe Vulpini ) had emerged , as well as a genus , Eucyon , that was ancestral to the tribe Canini . The latter group comprises the " canines " in the narrow sense of the term , and includes dogs , wolves , coyotes , jackals , certain foxes , and other species . An adult Hesperocyon gregarious , a canid species that could have been ancestral to all three major canid subfamilies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scene is set in western North America between 40 million and 34 million years ago , when early canids , like most other members of the order Carnivora , were still evolving in a forested environment . A key development in Caninae history was the spread of the subfamily out of North America , beginning about 7 million years ago , when some groups crossed the Bering land bridge into Asia . With the exception of a single species in the middle Miocene of China , hesperocyonines never escaped the dog family cradle , nor did any borophagines . Records of the Caninae appeared in Europe first , and almost immediately thereafter in Asia and Africa . The first member of the genus Canis--to which the gray wolf , coyotes , jackals , and the domesticated dog belong--loped onto the scene about 6 million years ago . During the subsequent epoch , the Pliocene ( 5.3 million to 1.8 million years ago ) , a further opportunity opened up for the Caninae . About 3 million years ago , the Panamanian Isthmus formed , linking North and South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native predators , and the Caninae were part of that success story , radiating explosively out of a few lineages in Central America and southern North America . Members of the subfamily constitute the largest group of carnivoran predators in South America today . Indeed , with eleven species , South America is home to almost one-third of the entire canid diversity on the planet . Just as the intercontinental flux led to a new peak of diversity among the canids--one that continues through the Pleistocene epoch and down to the present time--so , too , did it influence the array of prey . Ancestral horse species , which had lost their two outer digits but retained three , were eclipsed in North America by single-digit horses . By Pliocene to early Pleistocene times , the modem horse genus , Equus , had spread to Eurasia and South America , along with members of the camel family ( mostly llamas and their extinct relatives ) , which , like canids , had been confined to North America during much of their existence . While the Caninae subfamily thrived , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone-cracking dogs , which became extinct by the end of the Pliocene . The third canid expansion brought dogs into contact with hyaenids , which , with one brief exception during the Pliocene , had never expanded into North America . By the Pliocene , however , the competitive landscape had changed significantly for both families , and their members were n't fighting for the same fare . The foxes and jackal-like dogs that arrived in the Old World were much smaller than most hyaenids , which by now were all large , bone-cracking animals . A solitary Borophagus diversidens defends its prey from a pack of Canis lepophagus , Such a confrontation , whose outcome could go either way , may have been common a few million years ago . A bone-crushing species , B. diversidens was the last of the borophagines , whereas the would-be robbers were members of the ascendant genus Canis , whose living examples are the coyote , gray wolf ( including the domestic dog ) red wolf , Ethiopian wolf , black-backed jackal , golden jackal , and side-striped jackal . If we look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ursids , mustelids , and others--we see that each has a balanced spectrum of small and large species , but not the hyaenids . Apart from the aardwolf , which is a highly specialized termite-eater , there are only three living species of hyenas , all large carnivores . In the major carnivoran families , if the large-size species become extinct in the future , smaller forms could evolve to replace them . But if the large hyenas one day become extinct , their great evolutionary lineage will end . Climate change kicked into high gear during the Pleistocene epoch , whose alternating cold , dry ice ages and warm , humid intervals was a tumultuous time for all animal and plant evolution . Many mammal species on the northern continents ( North America and Eurasia ) , particularly herbivores , attained giant sizes as an adaptation to extreme cold . Large body size helped not only to conserve heat , but also to store more fat to cope with winter weather . Woolly mammoths , giant deer , and woolly rhinos roamed Eurasia , and the woolly mammoth , mastodon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire wolf reigned supreme in North America . Most such megafauna became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene , about 10,000 years ago . But the gray wolf , Canis lupus , is one of the few exceptions , and remains one of the most successful large canids in the world . From about the beginning of the Pleistocene the genus Canis has had a continuous presence in Eurasia , along with various species of fox and raccoon dog . Gray wolves are present beginning about 1 million years ago . Early humans--Homo erectus , H. neanderthalensis , and H. sapiens--must have competed with some larger species of canids , because they shared a broadly similar hunting ( and scavenging ) lifestyle . By the end of the Pleistocene , the inevitable close encounters between modern humans and wolves--in the Middle East or Europe , or possibly China--resulted in the first domestication of a canid . If one counts the domestic dog as a highly specialized adaptation for cohabiting with humans , then canids have achieved ultimate success in occupying nearly every corner of the world--in all sizes , shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) calls for its pack as a herd of mammoths ambles past .

##4022275 Fin-de-sicle Vienna may have flowered and faded more than a century ago , but the era remains a ubiquitous presence in the city today . Even if you do not visit the Belvedere Palace to see Gustav Klimt 's The Kiss , simulacrums of that embrace will accost you from posters , notebook covers , and caf menus . Emerge from the subway , and in all likelihood the sign announcing your stop will be the handiwork of fin-de-sicle architect Otto Wagner . The Caf Landtmann menu will not just let you know the price of a black coffee , but also inform you that Sigmund Freud was once a regular patron . Karl Kraus , Austria 's H. L. Mencken during the early 1900s , declared that the streets of Vienna are " paved with culture . " His aphorism holds true today--and the culture is tattooed with the words and images Kraus dissected a century ago . The fin-de-sicle fixation is , to be sure , played up for tourists . But it is not just for foreign consumption . The Viennese apex of modernized thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted through World War I , is enshrined in the national consciousness . Gustav Mahler may have had a stormy tenure as the general director and conductor of Vienna 's Imperial Opera ( he was forced out in 1907 after a decade ) , but last summer the Wiener Staatsoper schedule was a virtual homage to the composer . The Museum Quarter , which holds the majority of the city 's Egon Schiele expressionist paintings , is a meeting point for the city 's hipsters ; during the warm months you can spot kids on skateboards beneath banners of the Viennese artist 's portraits . Tourists may dominate the weekend crowd in the Belvedere Palace galleries , but Vienna 's dozens of museums would n't stay afloat if locals did n't religiously attend special exhibits and revisit the collections . The fact that the Viennese--indeed , Austrian--identity is so interwoven with the fin-de-sicle epoch has more than aesthetic implications . When culture is largely defined as the appreciation of a body of art , literature , and music that flourished decades ago , the national patrimony becomes something not just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like a living museum rather than a modern metropolis . And while some residents lament the relentless looking backward , many of Austria 's policies seem bent on maintaining a version of the country that does n't look so different from its glory days . The desire to freeze a society in time , rather than to allow it to change and innovate , has helped cultivate a xenophobic streak in the central European state . At least , it seemed that way to me last spring when I was living in the city , researching immigration practices . Austria makes it very difficult for a foreigner to settle within its borders ; its legal restrictions are some of the toughest in Europe . In conversations with the Viennese , I was struck by how often even young people defended this draconian approach . Aside from concerns about immigrants taking advantage of the country 's generous welfare benefits , the rationale for the keep-them-out policy centers around Austria 's small population ( just a little over eight million ) and the fragile national culture . " If we let people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one historical researcher said to me . " We would be overrun . " Austria is hardly the only country loath to accept foreigners . It is perplexing , however , that a country so enamored of its permissive fin de-sicle incarnation would cling to such an exclusionary view . Sipping coffee at Freud 's old haunt and admiring Klimt 's gold-flecked paintings , the Viennese may preserve a surface that looks a lot like the turn-of-the-century city . But the modern Viennese do not embrace the values that made the creative outpouring possible . The artistic pioneers of the late 1800s were n't hidebound by tradition ; instead , they were committed to embracing risk . And the city that created groundbreaking art , literature , and music was not homogeneous . Quite the opposite : it was a mix of outsiders--Jews , Czechs , and Hungarians--who created and financed advances in an extraordinary culture . " Diversity and immigration made that age possible , " Bernhard Perchinig , an analyst at the Institute for European Integration Research , told me . Glance over some of the names of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory holds up . The revolutionary thinkers Sigmund Freud and Ludwig Wittgenstein were both Jews , as were the writers Stefan Zweig and Arthur Schnitzler . Mahler was a Bohemian Jew . The expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka was Czech on his father 's side . And while the era 's two superstar painters--Klimt and Schiele--were Austrian-born and not Jewish , Vienna 's Jewish bourgeoisie underwrote their work . It is not an accident that Klimt 's most famous portraits were of Jewish women . His paintings often hung in the parlors of Jewish homes , at least until the onset of World War II . Why Austrians misconstrue the origin of their fin-de-sicle culture is murky , but the country 's role during World War II is certainly part of the explanation . Austria had a long history of anti-Semitism even before the Anschluss , the 1938 annexation by Nazi Germany . ( An Austrian by birth , Hider , for example , admired Viennese Mayor Karl Lueger 's verbal fusillades against Jewish residents when the future fhrer lived in Vienna in the early 1900s . ) It 's therefore not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial purity and nationalism . After Austria joined the Third Reich , a number of Hitler 's countrymen vigorously participated in the Holocaust . High-ranking Nazis like Adolf Eichmann grew up in Austria ; under his supervision 170,000 Austrian Jews were stripped of their jobs and fleeced of their possessions . Before the outbreak of the war , some 65,000 Jews were able to flee ( after giving up almost everything they owned ) . For the most part , those who remained were slaughtered in concentration camps . Today , only an estimated 7,400 Jews reside in the country . Austrians never had to deliver a comprehensive public accounting and repentance for this stained past . For Cold War geopolitical purposes , the Allies pronounced the country " Nazism 's first victim " after the war . The former members of the Third Reich seized on that appellation with gusto , drawing grumbles from some of Nazism 's true victims . " The Austrians are brilliant people , " Jewish Viennese migr and Hollywood director Billy Wilder is often quoted as saying . " They 've made the world believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilder did n't have to stop there . While Freud and Kokoschka are now among the innovators claimed as cultural royalty , they were forced to flee to England to save their lives on the eve of World War II . ( Kokoschka was deemed " degenerate . " ) The composer Arnold Schnberg decamped to Los Angeles , and **30;148;TOOLONG Stefan Zweig had already escaped from Austria to Great Britain . Jews , who had paid for and patronized so much of the city 's innovative art , were essentially expunged from Austrian soil . Given that so many of Vienna 's impressive creative citizens and their benefactors were ruthlessly persecuted , some historians have questioned whether modern-day Austria can legitimately claim Vienna 's fin-de-sicle movement as its own . The city 's fin-de-sicle strutting does have a shameless streak . But to be fair , Vienna 's institutions and ethos did play a role in nurturing one of the most extraordinary creative moments in modern history . Then , as today , appreciation for the arts was at the core of the city 's identity . Viennese coffeehouses did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intermingle and stay culturally attuned . Perhaps more important , most of these men stood apart from Viennese society but were nonetheless eager to gain recognition , and that made for a potent alchemy . Alienation is often a spur to creative expression . When these artists found existing norms of painting , literature , and social thought too confining , they pushed the boundaries . Today , the Viennese continue to patronize the coffeehouses and avidly peruse the newspapers ' swollen arts sections . Many of the Austrians I met during my three-and-a-half-month stay in the city made a point of alerting me to a lecture on Freudian psychology or sharing their opinions about the current hot-ticket theater production . There 's no question that Vienna is still steeped in the arts . But so often participation in the prevailing cultural life entails revisiting some aspect of the Golden Age . Martin Prinzhorn , a professor at the University of Austria and an independent art critic , says that looking back has been a part of the country 's makeup since the end of the First World War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has produced interesting work , particularly in the last decade , " he explains . " But nostalgia can suck the air out of Vienna 's artistic space . The newer artists are oftentimes overshadowed by what was produced in the past . " Fin-de-sicle Vienna was infatuated with contemporary artists , not former generations of creative pioneers . In his memoir , The World of Yesterday , Stefan Zweig remembered how in pre-World War I Vienna esteem for artistic movers and shakers cut across social classes . The day the city 's most prominent theater actress died , even the Zweigs ' cook dissolved into tears . " This old , semi-illiterate cook had never once been to the fashionable Burgtheater , " Zweig recounted , " but a great national actress was the collective property of the entire city of Vienna , and even an outsider could feel that her death was a catastrophe . " When artists are treated as demigods , it is understandable that ambitious young men ache to join their ranks . Given that foreigners and Jews were never completely integrated into high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters were particularly eager to establish a toehold in creative realms . For one thing , some of the more formal career paths were essentially off-limits . Freud once aspired to a military career but opted against it partly because Jews could not serve as officers in the Austro-Hungarian Empire . There were few formal barriers to becoming a novelist or artist , Achieving prominence in these spheres , moreover , offered entry to a ratified world . The World of Yesterday describes how every young writer dreamed of having a play produced in one of Vienna 's prestigious theaters because it guaranteed a " sort of lifelong nobility .. One virtually became a guest in the Imperial household . " In the Vienna of a hundred years ago , passersby did n't comment on spotting a minister-president , but the sight of an actor or opera director on the Ringstrasse would set people buzzing . Aside from providing an environment that exalted artistic accomplishment , Viennese institutions supplied creative young people with unusual opportunities to prepare for and hone their crafts . The city 's gymnasiums ( elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curricula produced graduates well versed in Western history , philosophy , and literature . Notably , Jews constituted a disproportionate portion of these schools ' enrollments . According to the historian Steven Beller , Jews accounted for 10 percent of Vienna 's population , but they made up about one-third of the gymnasiums ' student bodies . More important than the formal education system was Vienna 's informal university : the coffeehouse . As American cultural historian Carl Schorske describes in Fin-de-Sicle Vienna : Politics and Culture , the intelligentsia in Paris , London , and Berlin did n't mingle much . Vienna 's coffeehouse culture , in contrast , nurtured a cohesive creative class . Zweig recalled the long hours he spent in wood-paneled cafs as integral to his development as a writer . The witty aperu was highly prized in these settings ; relaxed chats , or even deep personal conversations , were not the purpose of these social circles . But if the occasional barb made the gatherings uncomfortable , it also prodded these men ( they were , almost without exception , men ) to become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in coffeehouses that these innovators crossed paths . Dip into the history of the era , and you may be convinced you 're reading about an extended , dysfunctional family . Consider this particular series of associations : Gustav Mahler and his wife , Alma , saw Freud for marriage counseling . After Gustav 's death , Alma became Kokoschka 's lover . The so-called wild painter of the fin de sicle was a protg of the architect Adolf Loos , who helped secure commissions for Kokoschka early in the painter 's career . The two men socialized with Arnold Schnberg , who had a separate , painful connection to another prominent Viennese painter : Schnberg 's wife , Mathilde , left him for the artist Richard Gerstl ( who committed suicide in 1908 after Mathilde returned to Arnold ) . These interactions and bed hoppings may seem trivial , but they left a mark on Vienna 's cultural patrimony . Schnberg 's compositions , for example , changed significantly during his personal crisis , which marked the period when he established himself as an atonal pioneer . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved formative . Schnberg regarded Karl Kraus as an inspiration--Kraus who , from the pages of his newspaper Die Fackel ( The Torch ) , launched a four-decade campaign against everything he considered hypocritical and artificial in Austrian society : " I have learned more from you , perhaps , than a man should learn , if he wants to remain independent , " the composer confided to his literary counterpart . Loos encouraged Kokoschka 's experimentation in a more concrete way : when sitters refused to buy the painter 's portraits , the architect purchased them . Unsurprisingly , Freud forged the broadest influence . His theories on the subconscious are , for example , glaringly present in Zweig 's novella Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman , which details an elderly woman 's unsettling encounter with a younger man . Freud himself discerned a kindred sensibility in Arthur Schnitzler , whose plays about bleak sexual exploitation and personal trauma convulsed Viennese society . " I have gained the impression , " Freud wrote his fellow doctor-turned-writer , " that you have learned through intuition . everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . " By the time Hitler marched into Vienna in 1938 , Freud had become an international celebrity . In his 80s and suffering from cancer of the jaw , he did not heed early warnings to leave the city , confident that his advanced age and prominence would protect him . After the Gestapo arrested and interrogated his daughter Anna , however , the Freuds fled to London , vowing never to return to Austria or to Germany . " Like you , I have an indomitable affection for Vienna and Austria , " the doctor wrote to a friend . " But unlike you , I know her abyss . " It was at the Caf Landtmann that I read about Our Vienna , an expos two Austrian journalists had published on looted Jewish property . Even the brief summary of the book made for intriguing reading . The synopsis detailed how many of the cultural landmarks I 'd admired for weeks--like the Prater Ferris wheel , which is showcased in the 1949 film The Third Man--had been expropriated from Jewish families . Intrigued , my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy in an English-language bookstore . While I knew the route , we made our way fitfully , because men in 18th-century dress interrupted us every few feet , flogging tickets to a classical music concert . They were n't the only relic of an earlier age patrolling the streets . Horse-drawn carriages , or fiacres , clopped by , carrying photo-snapping tourists . When loudspeakers beg-an blasting Mozart 's Don Giovanni , it felt like we had entered a " kitsch time machine . " Vienna : City of the Past " even had a soundtrack . The costumes , music halls , and carefully marketed museums all help to cultivate a thriving tourist industry . But as nay husband and I made our way to a less-trafficked part of the city , it occurred to me that the preserved-in-amber ethos came with a price tag . I had sampled many of Vienna 's creative offerings during my stay , visiting museums and the opera and attending the occasional lecture . But aside from a small gallery show featuring the work of sculptor Franz West , everything I had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , and sometimes the distant past . The publicly applauded version of the city 's history is , of course , airbrushed . When I asked for a copy of Our Vienna at the bookshop , I glimpsed the antagonism a more honest appraisal can engender . The bookseller , who had just been friendly to patrons seeking the latest Lonely Planet guide to Vienna , met nay request with an icy stare . " We do not have that book , " she replied . " Could you order it ? " my husband pressed , with a smile . She shook her head : " Not possible . " I never did track down a copy . The book I ended up re-reading compulsively was Zweig 's remembrance of the city of his youth . In The World of Yesterday he morosely speculated on what the future held for Vienna : " Only the coming decades will show the crime that Hider perpetrated against Vienna when he sought to nationalize and provincialize this city . " Zweig never saw the postwar version of the metropolis ; he committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before . But if he had lived to see present-day Vienna , he may have been puzzled as well as disillusioned . Trappings of the culture Zweig was so immersed in are still present . The " spiritual supernationality " that he prized , however , is no longer in evidence . It could be that the city 's turn-of-the-century artistic productivity was the equivalent of a cultural comet : It is extraordinary for a movement like that to emerge once , and no one should expect a repeat appearance . Still , the Austrian preoccupation with its prior incarnation and fear of a more diverse society has lessened the odds of another cultural apocalypse . Vienna is still saturated in the arts , but the country 's most fearless , productive , and creative years almost certainly lie decades in the past .

##4022362 Sabah , the second largest state in Malaysia , is located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo and borders the larger state of Sarawak to the southwest . The western part of Sabah is generally mountainous and contains the three highest peaks in Malaysia . The jungles of Sab'ah are classified as rainforests , with a tropical climate that provides a vast array of animal and plant species : an environment that seems ideal for creating biodiversity , which in turn provides exotic photographic opportunities . Four separate trips were taken to Sabah , encompassing a total of six weeks . The first trip was based in Kota Kinabalu , and allowed the exploration of the foothills of Kinabalu National Park and Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary . The second trip was in the company of professional wildlife photographers and visited Sepilok , the Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary at Labuk Bay and Turtle Island , which are essentially tourist destinations . There are two ecosystems of Sabah that were explored : the heart of the tropical rainforest , exemplified by Danum Valley and the riverine system offered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse species , and promise of unique images in a tropical rainforest , one has to get " down and dirty " or certainly hot and sticky . In May 2006 , several photographic colleagues from Singapore stayed at a guesthouse near Sukau on the Kinabatangan River . Twice daily , early morning and late afternoon , the group settled down in motorized boats with tripods set up and big lenses ready for the riverbank action . The participants glided up tributaries and into ox-bow lakes in search of that definitive shot . Bearded pigs swam across the river in front of the boat , river otters peered curiously from the mangrove mud , and colorful kingfishers plunged into the river ahead in a blur of iridescent blue and orange . Sharmas , babblers and pittas called from the forest floor while monkeys crashed noisily through the bush overhead One of the major targets in the late afternoon shoot was the Proboscis Monkeys Nasalis larvatus . Though easily seen during the day filling their potbellies with vegetation , these largish monkeys were skittish and moved away from the lenses . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle during the day and emerge along the riverbank around half an hour before sunset . The monkeys seem to transit from tree to tree with a careful assessment of distance , and then risk a reckless leap into space hoping that there was foliage to grasp at the end of the void . Mother monkeys held closed-eyed youngsters close to chest , while making tree-to-tree leaps . The onset of the evening seemed to act like a multi-targeted tranquilizer , as the hyperactive troupe would slow down and select a perch where they could spend the night in the cooler conditions above the river . The Proboscis Monkey is an endangered reddish-brown Old World monkey that is only found in Borneo . There is much debate as to the function of the large protruding nose of the males . It appears to have a role in sexual selection , as females prefer big-nosed males . The proboscis monkey is endemic to coastal mangrove , swamps and riverine areas . It lives in small groups of 10 to 32 animals and is both a proficient climber and swimmer . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these can be seen along the Kinabatangan River . Early morning or just before dusk is a good time to see the birds and get those typical flap-flap-glide flight shots as they cross the river in search of a fruiting tree or a roosting place . Fruiting trees on the rivers edge also attract wild orangutans . The first visit to the Kinabatangan River produced six sightings of solitary orangutans . What a buzz it was to see these great apes in the wild . The orangutans are two species of great apes known for intelligence , long arms , and reddish-brown hair . Native to Indonesia and Malaysia , the orangutans are currently found only in rainforests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra , though fossils have been found in Java . Vietnam and China . The name derives from the Malay and Indonesian phrase orang hutan , meaning " person of the forest . " Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes , spending nearly all of the time in trees , and at night , fashion nests from branches and foliage on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females generally come together only to mate , Mothers stay with the babies until the offspring reach an age of six or seven years . What is so emotional about seeing orangutans living free is that they appear to be on the brink of extinction . Sabah , once home to some of the world 's most biodiverse forests , was largely logged out during the 1980 's and 1990 's , but some parts of the state still support wild populations of endangered orangutans . World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) estimates that there are some 30,000 to 40,000 orangutans left in the wild threatened by habitat loss , poached for bush-meat and the illegal wildlife trade . Presently Borneo 's remaining forests are giving way to oil palm plantations . Oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis ) is a financially attractive plantation crop because it is the least expensive vegetable oil and produces more oil per hectare than any other oilseed . In the current environment of high-energy prices , palm oil is seen as a good way to meet increasing demand for biofuel as an alternative energy source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green rash . On the second visit to the Kinabatangan River the Borneo Pygmy Elephants ( Elaphus maximus horneensis ) were spied . The Pygmy is a sub-specie of the Asian elephant found only in north Borneo ( east Sabah and extreme north Kalimantan ) . The Borneo elephant became isolated from other populations of Asian elephants 18,000 years ago when land bridges disappeared . Compared with other Asian elephants it is smaller , with larger ears , a longer tail and comparatively straighter tusks . It is relatively tame and passive . The group succeeded in mooring the boat in the midst of one small herd that was bathing and cavorting on the rivers edge . Sadly the Borneo elephant is also on the critically endangered list , suffering from habitat loss , disrupted migration routes and depleted food sources . Amongst the colorful birds encountered along the river 's edge were two species of Broadbill : the Black and Red Broadbill and Black and Yellow Broadbill . The former species build their pendulous nests overhanging the water and during the nesting season a number of these can be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellow Broadbills are more secretive in locating nests but have a very distinctive call reminiscent of an electric generator starting up . A fruiting tree can be a magnet for many different species of bird as well as several mammals . In the quest for food scraps , bearded pigs have become adapted to human proximity . When the electricity generator is switched off late at night Sambar deer move under the cover of darkness onto the grassy areas to graze . Malay civets , clouded leopards , slow loris and the unique flying lemur may be seen in the beam of a spotlight at night . During the day a juvenile male orangutan moved noisily through trees quite close to the complex dining room . Long-tailed and Pigtailed macaques could also be seen foraging on the ground and clambering through the trees . Further down the road the tall roadside grasses had been flattened by a herd of Bornean elephants . There are a number of jungle tracks that require tougher trekking but provide visual rewards for the species that can be encountered : bearing in mind that leeches lurk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The male Great Argus pheasant described eloquently in the diary of Charles Darwin cavorts and calls for female attention in selected display grounds cleared on the jungle floor . The male bird has a call like an emergency siren and will cunningly usurp the trekking track , converting it into a bachelor 's pad . While observing the Great Argus another pheasant , the colorful Crested Fireback pheasant , made a brief appearance . Various members of the colorful pitta family can also be encountered on the more remote jungle tracks while small Barking Deer graze on the jungle floor or in small clearings . Consider Sabah for a photographic destination . Transport is reasonable and day-today living is relatively cheap . A good local guide with knowledge of what photographers require is recommended and be prepared to spend a suitable amount of time in an area to get good shots . Borneo , in spite of its problems , is unique in terms of flora and fauna . It is to be hoped that there will be a more judicious stewardship of the forest in future years to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLACK &; WHITE ) : Rehabilitated orangutan PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Crimson Sunbird ( male ) PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Blue-throated Bee-eater PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Long-tailed Macque feeding PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Orangutan mother and baby PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Lesser Green Leaf bird ( male ) PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Black and Red Broadbill pair PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Asian Darter PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Monitor lizard ( juvenile ) PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Bornean Pygmy elephant PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Red-eyed Bulbul By Graeme R.

##4070650 Ten years ago , I wrote a book that argued for a new vision of Southwestern prehistory : Chaco Meridian : Centers of Political Power in the Ancient Southwest . I still believe its premise--that something I call the Chaco Meridian played an essential role in the life of the ancient Puebloan people--but it 's due for an update , even if many of my colleagues still are n't completely convinced of the idea . <p> The Chaco Meridian is a north-south line at approximately 108 degrees longitude . Beyond the fact that all longitudes converge at the North Pole , there 's nothing inherently important about 108 degrees . In the American Southwest , however , the line runs through or very near several extremely important sites : Chaco Canyon , Aztec Ruins ( both in New Mexico ) , and Paquim ( just across the border in the Mexican state of Chihuahua ) . Each of these sites , in its time , was by far the biggest and almost certainly most important regional center in the Southwest . The population of each was probably between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large for the Southwest . And they followed one another as major centers in a tight sequence : Chaco from A.D. 850 to 1125 , Aztec from 1110 to 1275 , and Paquim from 1250 to 1450 . <p> It occurred to me that the bim-bam-boom sequence of Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim may have had something to do with history . That is , the lockstep series of rises and falls was probably not a matter of chance . Perhaps the collapse of one city somehow set off the rise of the next , with ruling elites moving from the old capital to the new . <p> We already had a pretty good idea that Chaco and Aztec were historically related . Lewis Henry Morgan , the " father of American anthropology , " figured that out in 1878 . The tree-ring dating was precise--Aztec immediately followed Chaco . Both had " Great Houses , " massive , geometrically exact , multistory buildings that transformed conventional Pueblo architecture into monumental edifices . The ancient Pueblo people left us another compelling clue : the " Great North Road , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north from Chaco Canyon to Aztec Ruins , just a hair east of 108 degrees longitude . My friend and colleague John Stein , of the Navajo Nation Chaco Protection Sites Program , established that many of the linear Chacoan features we called " roads " were , in fact , monuments--history written on the land--linking later Great Houses back to earlier ones . Stein called these " roads through time . " The Great North Road was a sacred pathway that connected 11th-century Chaco Canyon to 12th-century Aztec Ruins . <p> Back in the mid-1990s , several of my colleagues and I thought that Chaco was the capital of the 11th-century Pueblo world , and that in the 12th century Chaco 's rulers moved due north and rebuilt their city at Aztec . That sort of thing is not unknown in human history . Early Chinese capitals shifted following the principles of feng shui , the practice of aligning structures to ensure a harmonious flow of energy . <p> But ours was a minority view . Terms like " capital " and " city " and the idea of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not welcome in Southwestern archaeology . Most of us working then were trained to study the Pueblo past not as history , per se , but as a series of human adaptations to the sometimes difficult , often changing Southwestern environment . We were trained to treat ancient Pueblo societies like cultures in laboratory petri dishes : sprinkle the right amount of rainfall on the proper soil and up popped pueblos . That approach made a certain amount of sense , of course , because the Southwest is indeed a desert . <p> This emphasis on adaptation and environment led archaeologists to think locally : almost every cultural development was a local adaptation to the immediate environment . In retrospect , I think we overemphasized the desert and undervalued the history--the political decisions made by rulers ( and , perhaps , challenged by commoners ) that may or may not have made adaptive " sense . " <p> There was far more to the ancient Southwest than a grim struggle for food . Life at Chaco , for example , was not a precarious , hand-to-mouth existence . The Chacoans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( many from distant lands ) and important people ( perhaps a few from distant lands ) . Scarlet macaws from the Maya jungles and copper artifacts from western Mexico shared pride of place with elaborate seashell jewelry and eye-popping quantities of turquoise from faraway mines . You ca n't do that sort of stuff if you 're wondering where your next meal is coming from . And the city lasted two centuries as the economic , political , and ritual hub of a region the size of Ireland--definitely bigger than a petri dish . <p> In 1995 , I sat down to write an article , or maybe a book , arguing that our separate petri dishes actually existed in one large terrarium , a single ecosystem in which history--human political decisions--was more important than adaptation to the environment . The terrarium was really big : North America . And there was plenty of history south of the border , with Mesoamerican kings and wars and rises and falls . For some : reason , we seldom thought about those kinds of historical events in New Mexico . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Road as an illustration of large-scale history in the ancient Southwest , so I set out a big map of the region and dotted in a few key sites . I knew Paquim would come up ( one old theory held that Chaco was actually a colony of Paquim ) , but it was off my map . The latitude and longitude put it--whoops ! --due south of Chaco and Aztec . Hmm . The more I thought about it , the more I thought it might be possible the sites were connected . The old theory that linked Chaco and Paquim was based on good data but bad dating . With new dating , it became clear that Paquim came long after Chaco ( so Chaco could n't have been a Paquim colony ) , but immediately after Aztec . If they could move Chaco to Aztec , why could n't they move Aztec to Paquim ? <p> Well , it is a long , long way . The paltry 50 miles between Chaco and Aztec scared most Southwestern archaeologists--it was way bigger than our standard petri dish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that far ! To me , that was part of its appeal . The whacking great distance from Aztec to Paquim reduced Chaco-to-Aztec to a chip shot . The idea was too good to pass up , so I wrote a book , Chaco Meridian , in which I argued that ruling elites from Chaco Canyon first moved north to Aztec Ruins and a century later south to Paquim , reestablishing their capital along 108 degrees longitude , a north-south line that linked the old with the new . <p> The press liked Chaco Meridian because it was novel , it was news . Many of my archaeologist colleagues , however , resented it because the press liked it . But when the academic reviews appeared , they were surprisingly good . I expected my argument to be shredded , but of the dozen reviews I 've seen in journals , from American Anthropologist to Journal of Field Archaeology , only one was negative and it was very polite . ( I told the reviewer--an old mentor--that his review was " firm but fair . " ) <p> Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected to Chaco Meridian 's argument ( fair enough ) . My Paquim proposition in particular was roundly rejected by archaeologists working in Chihuahua , who had no use for Chaco elites . But even more archaeologists objected to the book 's breezy tone--much like this article . Not fair , but okay : I was n't writing for them , anyway ; I was writing to subvert their students , tomorrow 's professors . <p> In fact , the move from Chaco to Aztec has come to be accepted by most , but not all , archaeologists . So half of the original argument apparently convinced my colleagues . Far fewer bought my idea that the Chacoan elites eventually moved to Paquim . And there the matter seemed to rest . <p> BUT IN 2004 , a site far to the north , well beyond the points on the old Chaco Meridian , got me hopping-up-and-down excited again . I was driving to the Pecos Conference , a yearly gathering of Southwestern archaeologists , and had time to stop by the Animas-La Plata Project ( ALP ) . Just south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ahead of the construction of a dam and reservoir . Jim Potter , the project director for the cultural resources firm SWCA , Inc. , showed me around . I was immensely impressed by the size and complexity of the pit-house sites , which dated to the eighth century A.D. There was nothing in the ALP area immediately before the eighth century , and nothing after . It was a big--but short-lived--bang . <p> From the east end of the ALP area to the west end , a distance of some eight miles , there were more eighth-century sites than in any other area in the northern Southwest . It was a continuous blur of houses and villages : not of urban density , but taken together a very large , impressive settlement . In the middle of it all stood Sacred Ridge ( an old local name for the site ) . ALP excavators found things on Sacred Ridge that no one had ever seen at eighth-century sites , such as the 10-foot-wide base of a two-story tower . Nobody built towers in the eighth century ! The ALP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , and at its core stood phenomenal architecture . <p> I walked through the ALP sites and wondered where we were exactly . A glance at a map showed the area was due north of Chaco Canyon , due north of Aztec Ruins , and due north of Paquim . Well , not precisely due north--Sacred Ridge is actually a few miles east of Pueblo Bonito , Chaco 's biggest great house . ( As I argue in Chaco Meridian , we should n't expect modern precision from people doing naked-eye engineering with a string and a pole . ) I 'm pretty sure Potter and his colleagues were aware of that fact and , understandably , they do n't want to go there , given Chaco Meridian 's somewhat controversial reputation . But I do . <p> The ALP sites jogged my memory of another , even earlier big site , back at Chaco Canyon . The " Chaco " of Chaco Meridian was the grouping of stone-masonry Great Houses of the 11th and early 12th centuries , like Pueblo Bonito . But there had been strange doings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixth and early seventh centuries , Shabik'eschee Village and another unnamed pit-house site ( known as 29 SJ 423 ) flourished in the canyon . These sites were not visually spectacular ( scores of shallow depressions , each representing an ancient pit house ) , but they were big , indeed the biggest pit-house sites of their times in the Pueblo region . Each had more than 80 houses , and each had a Great Kiva , an underground ceremonial chamber that was a rarity in the sixth century . The next largest sites of that period had about 20 pit houses ( and those are hailed as prodigies ) , and 99 percent of the sites of Shabik'eschee 's time were made up of only one or two houses . <p> Shabik'eschee had been excavated and published in the 1920s . It was a famous anomaly , not a secret or a surprise ( like ALP ) . But between Shabik'eschee 's end in the seventh century and the late-ninth-century beginning of the Great Houses , Chaco Canyon was abandoned . This had always been an obstacle to linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly excavated ALP sites filled that gap . In Chaco Meridian , I wrote that the center shifted , first north and then south . A picture was emerging in which that north-south movement reached even farther back in time . Each Pueblo era , from A.D. 500 to 1275 , had a single , central , large , complicated site , and each was on or very near the Meridian : Shabik'eschee/423 in the sixth and seventh centuries ; Sacred Ridge and the ALP complex in the eighth century , followed by the succession of Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim . All these sites were located from 107 degrees 50 feet longitude to 108 degrees--an east-west wobble of only a few miles on a line of 475 miles , from Sacred Ridge on the north to Paquim on the south . <p> Shabik'eschee , Sacred Ridge , Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim--five unique points in a line , each the biggest and most important site of its respective era . The chances of that happening by accident are miniscule .

##4070652 IT 'S EASY TO THINK that the $13.2 billion-a-year spent in the United States on cosmetic enhancement amounts to an abnormal obsession with beauty . Noses are modified and breasts are reshaped to correct perceived flaws , but most procedures are aimed at making us look younger . Liposuction and tummy tucks remove the fat that accumulates with age and childbirth ; face-lifts and poisonous Botox injections paralyze and stretch wrinkled skin smooth . What a person hopes to see in the mirror reflects what his or her society values most , in our case , youth . <p> The ancient Maya also went to extreme lengths to transform their bodies . They invested vast amounts of wealth--and endured unspeakable pain--to make themselves beautiful . Through their artwork and the study of their physical remains we can begin to understand what motivated their search for physical perfection . What did ancient Maya men and women hope to see when they looked in their pyrite mirrors ? <p> Perhaps the men wanted to look like K'inich Janaab ' Pakal ( Pakal the Great ) , who ruled the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 612 until his death in 683 . Few ancient Maya remains have been as thoroughly studied as Pakal 's . His tomb within Palenque 's Temple of the Inscriptions provides a clear view of the standard of beauty to which ancient Maya men aspired . A stucco head wedged under his sarcophagus and a mosaic jade mask on his face convey idealized notions of his appearance . But what did he look like in real life ? <p> From my first visit to Palenque in 1975 , and throughout my nearly 30-year career as a Mesoamerican art historian , I 've been asking questions about this man who made Palenque a force to be reckoned with and then built his own great funerary pyramid , a ruler whose descendants worshiped him as a deity . <p> Pakal 's bones and teeth were recently restudied by Vera Tiesler and Andrea Cucina of the Autonomous University of Yucatan , and they can now tell us more about his physical appearance . First , Pakal was taller than most ancient Maya men , standing just over five feet four inches . And unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease or malnutrition . Pakal received the typical cranial modification for someone born into an elite family . Shortly after birth , while his skull was still soft and growing , his mother applied a binding device to his forehead so that his cranium grew into a long , tapered form , smartly indented above the brow line . <p> As a king , Pakal was expected to personify several important deities . In stone carvings , his clothing and adornments reflect associations with the gods of rain and lightning , but his body was shaped to resemble the Sun and Maize gods . Pakal 's mother may have hung a bead between his eyes when he was a baby so that he would become permanently cross-eyed , a trait associated with the Sun God . <p> The Maya believed that because they had to squint to look at the sun , the Sun God also squinted back at them . Crossed eyes would have given Pakal the appearance of squinting . Also like the Sun God , he had filed teeth in the shape of the letter " T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of his face . At the time of his death , Pakal had lost two molars and periodontal disease may have given him some pain , but the 24 teeth in his mouth had not a single cavity . <p> The earliest image of Pakal , a profile carving on an oval tablet found in his royal palace , emphasizes his flattened forehead . His simply rendered body reveals a slim physique . Pakal also had luxuriant hair , which he wore in thick , layered tresses trimmed to blunt ends in the front and tied in the back . His hair flopped forward like corn silk surrounded by leaves at the top of a healthy maize plant . Because each kernel on a cob requires a strand of silk to be pollinated , abundant corn silk pointed to a healthy cob of maize--and Pakal 's hair indicated his maize-like perfection . <p> Images of him suggest he wore a nosepiece to extend the long , tapering line of his nose into his forehead . How the nosepiece was worn is not known , but it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated captives depict them with prominent foreheads and round or snub noses , while the victorious lords are shown with the bridge of their noses meeting their foreheads in an unbroken line that sometimes extended all the way to their hair . <p> ACCORDING TO THE POPOL Vuh , the creation story of the K'iche Maya , creator gods formed human beings out of masa , the same maize dough the Maya still use to make tortillas and tamales . The typical maize plant yields one healthy ear ; others ripen only as nubbins or succumb to the maize fungus , Ustilago maydis . Like the plant , the Maize God surrounded himself with dwarves and hunchbacks , symbolizing imperfect ears of maize--embodiments of the ugly and deformed . Maya rulers also associated with dwarves and hunchbacks . <p> The Maize God lived for only a single season--growing and ripening , then harvested and planted once again as a tiny kernel in an eternal cycle of death and rebirth . Although Pakal surely grew wrinkled in old age , depictions of him and most Maya elites always retain a youthful appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is shown with his hair styled like the Maize God and a burning torch protruding from his forehead like K'awiil , a lightning deity worshiped by Palenque 's royalty . Once they laid the dead king within the sarcophagus , his attendants placed a mask bearing the Maize God 's features made of small jade tesserae , like individual maize kernels , onto his face , giving him the appearance of eternal youth even in death . In this sense he was planted like a maize kernel at the base of the Temple of Inscriptions . Pakal both lived and died as the Maize God . <p> MAYA STANDARDS OF BEAUTY based on the Maize God applied to women as well as men . Pakal , for example , is shown on the lid of his sarcophagus wearing the Maize God 's jade skirt . It is the same skirt his mother is shown wearing on an oval tablet from the royal palace at Palenque . Women 's skulls were also bound into elongated shapes , and they filed their teeth or drilled holes in them to hold inlays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another fashion that men and women shared was painting their bodies with abstract designs . <p> In one of the extraordinary murals at Bonampak in southeastern Chiapas , a servant daubs paint on a royal dancer . Males glisten with red from the neck down , while women have red paint only on their faces . The complementary patterns appear to be one of many localized fashions in body painting that extended across the Maya world and that involved a variety of colors and designs . When Pakal 's body was prepared in an elaborate embalming process , his skin was treated with alternating layers of red and black pigments , most of which were concentrated on his trunk . As Tiesler and Cucina have determined , the red paint consisted largely of the toxic mineral cinnabar , or vermilion , with a little hematite and iron ore in the mix . <p> Blue-green was considered the most beautiful pigment , perhaps because it was associated with jade , the most valuable material of ancient Mesoamerica . Blue shades ( see " Sacred Maya Blue " ) were associated with sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only as the source of sustenance but also as the sacred material from which humans were formed . Unlike almost all else in the tropical rain forest , jade was permanent and thus made the ideal funerary offering . It evoked the Maize God , permanence , and the essence of beauty . Reduced even to a single bead , jade could germinate and yield the tender maize once again , the Maya believed . <p> BEAUTY WAS ENHANCED BY piling On elaborate jade jewelry or by wearing fashionable clothing . Paintings at both Bonampak and Calakmul , along with sculptures at Yaxchiln and Piedras Negras in southern Mexico , confirm women 's interest in fashion . Those of high status wore gauzy cotton dresses over contrasting underskirts , brocaded dresses cinched at the waist , and patterned shifts and blouses draped over wrapped skirts . By about A.D. 700 , women gained political and economic power , and this may have been reflected in their clothing . Two of the most prominent ancient Maya women , the queen of Yaxchiln , Lady Xook , and the queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns in their clothing . The stone carvings commissioned by Lady Xook for her building on the site 's main plaza show her wearing three different outfits in a conspicuous display of her taste in fashion . Beaded dots of face paint or scarification are similar to other artistic representations that symbolize elegant speech or song . <p> Both queens were somewhat hefty , a testament to their wealth and status . Most elites ate a refined diet , as their teeth reveal , including cacao , or kakaw , as the Maya called it . Cacao beans served as ancient Mesoamerica 's standard means of exchange . Eating chocolate was like eating money itself . Chocolate was one of the rare Maya foods rich in fat , so fat signaled wealth and power , if not beauty itself . <p> IMAGES OF BEAUTY also provided moral lessons for the Maya . Stylized funerary figurines from the island of Jaina , off the Yucatan Peninsula , show two typical examples of female beauty . One , probably a young Moon Goddess , emphasizes a voluptuous , youthful figure/often bare-breasted . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue pigment . Her hair is parted and twisted into a headdress of cotton cords , indicating her role as a patron of weaving ; her face is highlighted with pigment or tattooing , usually in a dotted pattern near the mouth . <p> Young and beautiful , the Moon Goddess frequently accepts the embrace of a companion . In some cases it is an anthropomorphic rabbit who was thought to live in the moon , but often the companion is a creator god depicted as an old man , whose collapsed toothless face is , like hunchbacks and dwarves , the antithesis of beauty . In some figurines he is seen lifting her skirt or touching her breast . Here the Maya artist seems to draw attention to the woman 's wayward behavior , perhaps as a moral commentary . <p> The second type of female figurine is more enigmatic . She wears a draped blouse over a wrapped skirt , and in many cases a heavy necklace that required a counterweight down her back . The front of her face is framed by sharply trimmed bangs . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a bead , hanging over her bangs . Her face is sometimes marked with prominent striations representing scars or tattoos extending from her lip line almost to her ears . She works at her loom , prepares food , or sits modestly with hands on the knees of her crossed legs . She is a paragon of industry and probably virtue , since she is never seen cavorting with old gods or the odd mammal . <p> BEAUTY WAS A WAY to display social , if not moral , value among the ancient Maya . The wealth they invested and pain they endured to create bodies that reflected their social beliefs make our modern-day obsession with beauty seem less excessive . Like us , the Maya indulged in self-deception about appearance , preferring to let artistic depictions conform to their ideals rather than reality . Although hearty and robust for an old man of 80 , Pakal 's depiction never aged ; he remained a youthful Maize God , just on the cusp of maturity . The Maya saw what the Maya wanted to see when they looked into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few daubs of red paint , and the youthful vigor of agricultural fertility . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An ancient Maya ruler checks his reflection in a pyrite mirror while an attendant applies red paint to his backside .

##4070653 THE NORTH SEA deserves its tempestuous reputation . It pounds England 's eastern coast , reshaping and sometimes taking large bites from it . The medieval town of Dunwich ( DUN-itch ) thrived on that coast from the 11th to the 14th century . Built on fishing , shipbuilding , trade , and religious patronage , its economy was one of the largest in the land . Over the centuries , the sea ate away at the town , reducing it to its present state , a seaside village of fewer than 200 . Despite legends of a sunken city , the prevailing wisdom has been that the sea ground almost all of medieval Dunwich to sediment , and buried it or carried it away . Some divers have long suspected otherwise , as they occasionally encountered tantalizing clues such as stone blocks , but it was not until 2008 that there was proof , courtesy of multibeam and side-scanning sonar , that Dunwichs major buildings--churches , chapels , and monasteries--lay ruined but still in place below the whitecaps . However , because of the North Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another planet . <p> Dunwich was probably the site of a Roman fort and Saxon settlement before it became a major port city . The Domesday Book , a great survey of English wealth in 1086 , listed it as one of the 10 largest towns in England , with three churches and yearly royal taxes of 68,000 herring . It was the seat of the first bishop of East Anglia , and at its height had 20 religious buildings , including homes for the Knights Templar and the monastic orders of the Blackfriars and Greyfriars--all in a square-mile town with a population between 3,000 and 5,000 . <p> But according to David Sear , a geomorphologist at the University of Southampton , " it was a bit of a duff place to build on , really . " The harbor area was often inundated , and the rest of the town was perched on a crumbly cliff 20 to 30 feet above a narrow beach . As early as 1086 , major losses of land had been documented . A cooling of the climate in the 13th century brought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A storm in 1287 claimed a quarter of the city , including three churches ; another in 1328 took hundreds of houses . " The problem with Dunwich is amplified because it started off so big , " says Sear . " It sort of grew too large in the wrong place . " Storms also blocked Dunwichs port , despite the citizenry 's best efforts to keep it clear , crippling its economy . The erosion claimed both land and population ; churches abandoned for lack of parishioners eventually dropped off the cliff . The last fragment of the town 's medieval prosperity , All Saints Church , toppled between 1904 and 1919 , and even today bones from its churchyard cemetery tumble out of the cliff face . " It is a haunting place , and on a winter 's day , one could say , a bit sinister , " says Stuart Bacon , an amateur archaeologist and expert on the area . " It is also a very romantic place with the sun shining and the city under the sea . " <p> Bacon learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . " The North Sea is very hostile in all senses , he says . You can almost feel the hostility when you 're out there . " Sediment in the water means there is not enough visibility to read a watch or air gauge , but Bacon persisted and soon found the well-documented remains of All Saints , a tight scatter of large stone blocks a few dozen yards from the beach . He devised techniques to help him dive blind , feeling around with gloveless hands and a metal rod , determining what kind of stone he found by sound and vibration . But navigating and relocating sites were constant problems . " You 've got to imagine a site potentially occupying a square mile , into which you drop down and sort of fumble around in the dark until you 've found something , " says Sear . " And what 's amazing is that Bacon did actually find stuff . " <p> One day in 1973 , Bacon had a yard or two of visibility , the best he has ever encountered . He swam out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard to get a sense of the extent of them , but he believed they came from St. Peter 's , which fell from the cliff around 1680 . He found the site again several times over the years , encountered more stone , and retrieved artifacts , including a quarter-ton chunk of a tomb lid , now in the small Dunwich Museum . " All the time I was being told there was nothing there and I was proving the opposite , " he says . But there was no way to establish how much of a structure or the town itself survived , or relocate sites reliably . <p> SEAR IS NEITHER AN ARCHAEOLOGIST nor a diver . Rather , as a geomorphologist , he studies how sediments move in riverbeds or along the coast . " It 's one of those rare occasions where one 's passion and one 's research interests intersect , " he says . His fascination with Dunwich began when he was a child of five and his family vacationed there every summer . At low tide , he clambered on some exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local legends , like the old smuggler 's tale that on stormy nights , the peals of Dunwich 's church bells can still be heard . <p> The assumption that the town 's ruins were gone , except for the more recently lost All Saints , was still common , despite Bacons finds . " That 's not an unreasonable assumption if you do n't know anything about sediment dynamics , " Sear says . The ruins of Dunwich , he thought , should still be roughly where they fell from the cliff because there was not enough wave or tidal energy to move massive pieces of stone and mortar . <p> In 2006 , Sear approached Bacon with the idea of cutting through the dark world with multibeam and side-scanning sonar , acoustic technologies that can provide high-resolution depth readings and some indication of the hardness of the seabed . Sear had the GeoData Institute at Southampton superimpose and stretch historic maps of Dunwich over images of the modern coastline to determine targets . He then contracted EMU Ocean Surveys to spend two days in May 2008 mapping the entirety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like mowing your lawn , " he says . <p> The first-ever 3-D map of the seabed off Dunwich showed that two-thirds of the medieval site is covered by thick sandbanks . Fortunately , a natural tidal channel cuts through the site , scouring out a sort of valley on the seabed . In this area , Sear identified a number of promising sites where hard material stood a yard or so above the soft sand . Religious buildings would have been among the only in town built with stone--a relatively rare commodity in that part of England--while the rest were made from timber . Two of the sites lined up with churches on Sear 's maps : St. Peter 's and St. Nicholas 's , which went over around 1480 . Most important , the survey provided GPS data , so the sites Bacon once stumbled across could be mapped and relocated . " The question was , could you make the reports of ruins into something coherent ? " says Edward Martin of the Suffolk Archaeology Service , which was not directly involved in the research . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey . " <p> Working by feel , divers reported wall-like surfaces , flat stone , and beveled edges , and brought back samples with what appears to be mortar on them . Confident he has found the churches , Sear now has proof that such stone structures can remain in place and more or less together on active coastlines , and established a working method for places with miserable diving conditions . <p> THE OLDEST ACCURATE MAP of Dunwich dates to 1589 , and shows the location of St. Peter 's . However , by then several religious buildings and perhaps half the town were already gone . We know there were quite a lot of churches , but we do n't know the full extent of the town , " says Martin . " There 's about half of it missing and we know nothing about how it was formed , its arrangement . " <p> Sear is most interested in this period , the remains of which probably lie under the offshore sandbar , around 380 yards from the beach . Specifically , he wants to map the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main church ( St. John 's , lost around 1540 ) , and harbor area . <p> To do this , he needs funds to test sub-bottom profiling equipment , which passes a sonic signal through soft material like sand to reflect off underlying stone . In addition , to examine St. Peter 's and St. Nicholas 's in more detail , Sear wants to use higher-resolution multibeam sonar and a Didson sonar device , a diver-held or submarine-mounted short-range sonar that can provide detailed images even in zero visibility , like night-vision goggles for a dark underworld . There could be anything down there--from artifacts to carved surfaces--and this technology is how they will find it . Designed for examining naval mines and ship hulls , the Didson system has yet to see wide use on archaeological sites , according to the manufacturers , but the eerie , high-resolution images it can provide suggest it soon will . <p> Peter Murphy of English Heritage , which provided some of the funding for Sear 's research , says that little work has been done on such fully submerged sites in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise awareness of how coasts change over time . In that sense , the exploration of medieval Dunwich is perhaps a glimpse of the future of coastal archaeology , as ancient sites and even modern structures are increasingly subject to rising sea levels , increased storm frequency and intensity , and greater erosion . Techniques for getting a look at these zero-visibility sites--from metal bars to high-resolution handheld sonar--might become indispensable tools . What we lose in legends of sunken cities might come back as clear knowledge of the past . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Coastline <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Multibeam sonar shows clumps of hard material standing above the soft , sandy floor of a tidal channel .

##4070654 WHATEVER 19TH-CENTURY RAILCAR MAGNATE George Pullman took with him to the grave is likely to remain a mystery . Fearful that Labor-movement extremists would desecrate his corpse , Pullman left instructions that his lead-lined casket be covered in tar paper and asphalt , and laid in a massive vault of concrete reinforced with steel rails in Chicago 's Graceland Cemetery . Over this tomb stands a towering Corinthian column with the name " Pullman " carved in its base . Fortunately , the historical record beneath the other monument bearing his name , the town of Pullman , is far more accessible . In what is today Chicago 's far South Side , archaeologists are unearthing the remnants of a model community . Built to be " beautiful and harmonious , " it was intended to be a place where , in the words of its founder/strikes and other troubles that periodically convulse the world of labor would not need to be feared . " <p> " This site affords opportunities to study the daily life of workers as well as class distinctions in this richly textured 19th-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor and chair of DePaul University 's anthropology department . It is also important to the present-day residents of Pullman , many of whom are intimately acquainted with the town 's history and worked to save the neighborhood from demolition in the 1960s . " It provides a chance to examine a rare instance of a working-class community of today rising up to save itself from the wrecking ball , " she says . <p> Pullman was designed with 900 " worker cottages " made of solid brick , more than 95 percent of which are still occupied today . In the center of town was a grand complex of commercial and industrial buildings , anchored by a corporate administration building topped with an iconic wood-framed clock tower . The town was also artfully laced with parks and gardens . <p> The London Times was not alone in hailing Pullman as " the most perfect town in the world , " at least until a nationwide economic depression compelled the town 's founder to lay off one-third of his workforce and slash the wages of the remainder by an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , not to mention food and other necessities , workers walked off the job in the summer of 1894 . Their appeal to the fledgling American Railway Union , led by Eugene V. Debs , resulted in the union calling on its members to stop handling any trains that included Pullman cars . As Pullman all but monopolized passenger railcar operations , train traffic virtually came to a halt across the country . <p> Refusing to negotiate any kind of settlement , Pullman won the battle but lost the war . The strike petered out after a few months , due in no small part to aggressive intervention by the federal government . Public opinion , however , had turned against Pullman for his hard-line stance on his workers . A federal strike commission likewise laid much of the blame at Pullman 's doorstep , and the Illinois Supreme Court ordered him to sell off the residential sections of his town , his self-proclaimed " greatest work . " George Pullman died of a heart attack on October 19 , 1897 . His factory continued producing railroad cars until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial interests . <p> IN 1998 , a few years before DePaul launched an anthropology program with an emphasis on historical archaeology in Chicago , a homeless man had heeded the voices in his head that told him to set fire to the Pullman administration building . Although the clock tower was destroyed in the ensuing blaze , many of the original administration building 's 125-year-old masonry walls survived . Before reconstruction of the building began , site superintendent Mike Wagenbach wanted to make sure the effort would not destroy the sites subsurface historical record . In 2004 , DePaul visiting professor Bill Middleton took 16 students to Pullman to conduct targeted excavations at what is now the Pullman State Historic Site . <p> Middleton and his students found very little in the areas that would be impacted by the reconstruction , which allowed the work to proceed . The following summer , Baxter began working at the site . Laboring in the shadow of the recovering administration building , her 22 students spent five weeks learning to survey , map , excavate , record , process , and document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground tunnel through which power from an immense Corliss steam engine--the most powerful in the world at the time--was distributed to the manufacturing buildings and steam heat was channeled to public buildings and select residences . <p> Pullman has proved to be a gold mine for industrial archaeology . The one-of-a-kind Corliss , standing 40 feet tall and weighing 700 tons , was a big hit at Philadelphia 's 1876 Centennial Exhibition , for which it was initially constructed . Housed in a glass-fronted building in Pullman , it was just as big an attraction there until it was cut up for scrap when the company was electrified in 1910 , about the same time it made the transition from manufacturing wooden railcars to those made of steel . <p> Baxter is equally interested in the sociology of the workplace . " It seems obvious , but it 's often overlooked in industrial archaeology . People actually worked in factories , " she says . In 1892 , Pullman employed more than 6,000 workers ; about one-quarter were American born , and the rest came from nearly 30 different countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her students to consider . <p> On this front , too , Pullman does not disappoint . Outside two of the remaining factory door openings of the administration buildings north assembly shop wing , which survived the fire , the DePaul students found food refuse and fragments of ceramic cups and plates . Baxter surmises that lunch breaks were informal affairs , much as workers today might step outside for a smoke . Even more telling are the differences between two separate break areas . In one , unmarked 19th-century whiteware and cuts of meat ( evidenced by the animal bones ) are of a distinctly cheaper quality than that found in the other , suggesting that workers may have socialized according to class . <p> Even within a town that claimed to promote Utopian ideals , there were significant distinctions among Pullman workers . Beyond ethnic and religious differences , highly skilled craftsmen , including woodcarvers , cabinetmakers , blacksmiths , brass finishers , millwrights , and patternmakers , earned top dollar while unskilled laborers earned , in many instances , less than half that . And where an employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could afford to pay in rent . High-wage earners tended to live in the largest , fanciest , and most expensive residences clustered around the town center . Low-wage earners lived in houses and multifamily dwellings , which , moving away from the town center block by block , grew steadily smaller , more plain , and less expensive to rent . The overall effect was a hierarchy of housing that roughly paralleled worker wages . <p> REGARDLESS OF THEIR PLACE in the town 's pecking order , workers would have passed by the largest and most ornate home in Pullman every day . Occupied by company manager H. H. Sessions , it was directly across the street from the main factory gate . According to an 1886 map , it was the only residence with a carriage house . A 1909 fire insurance map refers to the detached structure as a garage . Aside from one exceptionally poor-quality photograph , no other documentary evidence or living-memory exists of the two-story garage , though the house still stands . <p> Excavating the site--for many years an informal parking area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to as the Sessions House--students discovered the previously undocumented limestone foundation of the carriage house . Measuring about 30 feet long by 20 feet wide , it bore a cutout large enough to receive power and steam from the Corliss engine , indicating that the building was heated . Befitting the buildings function , students found numerous **26;1408;TOOLONG artifacts , such as bits of horse tack and related finery . They also unearthed household items and remains of plumbing , suggesting a caretaker was in residence . <p> The most intriguing discovery , however , came before the students even started digging . Atop the site were heaps of displaced soil , which Baxter learned had come from the home of Kris Thomsen , two doors away . Like many Pullmanites , Thomsen can recite the history of his house chapter and verse , from the impeccably restored gem that it is today , to its central role as a speakeasy during Prohibition , to its original function as the home and office of John McClean , the company physician . In preparation to install footings for a new back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomsen 's contractors excavated several buckets of soil and got rid of them where they thought no one would notice . <p> Fortunately , Baxter noticed and had her students sift through the dirt . In addition to an intact glass medicine vial , they found a cornucopia of personal items , including thimbles , glass marbles , hairpins , dish fragments , and even a small-caliber bullet casing . Most curious of all was what Baxter described as a disproportionately high concentration of buttons ; primarily shell buttons common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . <p> Company records reveal that McClean treated 4,155 injured factory workers over a 10-year period beginning in 1884--an average of more than one a day . The majority of injuries were serious enough to result in the loss of at least two days of work . " In your typical 19th-century industrial accident , " Baxter points out , " your arm or hand is caught up in a belt or some piece of heavy machinery and it 's not pretty . " McClean , a former Civil War battlefield surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have had to cut the clothing off the injured limb . The cloth , disposed of with other household trash in the large backyard , would have rotted away over time , but the buttons remained as reminders of the danger inherent even in so advanced a manufacturing setting as Pullman . <p> ON A BRIGHT , UNSEASONABLY MILD SUNDAY in late July , Baxter scheduled a public archaeology day as part of the 2008 field school . The event was particularly meaningful to the present-day residents of Pullman , including those who rose up in the 1960s when a local chamber of commerce recommended demolishing the entire 19th-century town for real-estate development . " That really got everyone in an uproar , " remembers George Ryan , who has lived in Pullman every one of his 88 years . " We had this big rally , people were standing up , yelling . We loved our community . For us , there was no better place to go . " Pullman was and is still a largely working-class community , but over the years residents have obtained city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve several key public buildings . <p> Twenty-five people showed up for the public archaeology day to carry on the legacy of community activism . Each volunteer was assigned to one of several student-led teams excavating the foundations of walls of the well-documented Arcade Building , one of the nation 's first indoor malls . In its heyday , the three-story structure housed dozens of shops , along with a post office , the Pullman Bank , a 1,000-seat theater , and an 8,000-volume library . <p> Among the amateur archaeologists was Andy Bullen , who lives in one of Pullman 's original " executive " houses with his wife , Linda . He developed and maintains the Pullman Virtual Museum ( www.pullman-museum.org ) , an online digital catalogue of images from several of the region 's archives . " To see the size of the foundation stones gives you this gut sense of the scale and mass of the building that you ca n't really get from pictures , " he says . " To stand on the sidewalk where the federal soldiers stood before the strike of 1894--personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the great chain of continuity . " <p> As part of the 2008 field school , Baxter also had her students excavate a couple of present-day backyards , finding the remains of a previously undocumented root cellar and a smattering of personal items , including doll parts and china sherds that hint at the lives of 19th-century Pullman workers and their families . <p> -But after two seasons , Baxter feels she 's just scratched the surface . " The story of Pullman is not a simple one . It 's not just the autocratic patriarch versus his unhappy workers . It 's much more complex than that , much more subtle . But I need to investigate more . " <p> Pullman residents ca n't wait for her return . " With more archaeology , more study and information , " says Arlene Echols , who loved every minute the students spent excavating the backyard of her worker 's cottage , " we 'll all be better stewards of our historic homes , better stewards of our present community .

##4070655 A SURPRISE DISCOVERY on the outskirts of Rome . Five containers hold unidentified bodies . Four of them are children . A woman 's body is missing . The police are called in to investigate . Who are these people ? What is their relationship to one another ? How did they die ? But this is not a modern crime scene , it 's a remarkable archaeological discovery--five ancient Roman marble sarcophagi that escaped looters for more than 1,800 years with their lead seals intact . Archaeologists are working with scientists from the police Crime Scene Investigation unit to tell the personal story of a wealthy suburban family , and a broader one about the ancient Roman countryside . <p> During renewal projects aimed at transforming an area of the town of Tor Cervara into a shopping destination , a bulldozer uncovered the tops of two underground tombs . Construction work stopped immediately and Stefano Musco from the Archaeological Superintendency of Rome was called to investigate . Inside the first , rectangular tomb , he found the cover and part of the base of a badly broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nine-foot-wide circular tomb , he saw niches holding five sarcophagi dating to the third century A.D. " To discover unviolated sarcophagi is particularly rare and very fortuitous for an archaeologist , " says Musco . Since the early 1990s , when several unopened second-century A.D. sarcophagi were discovered at Vallerano , south of Rome , none have been found in the countryside around the city . And according to Musco , very few examples have been found anywhere in Italy , the best known being the Tomb of the Athlete in Taranto ( " Tomb of the Unknown Jock , " ARCHAEOLOGY , September/October 2008 ) , and some from the late Etruscan period ( second century B.C. ) at locations such as Perugia and Cortona in central Italy . <p> Musco and his team cleaned and conserved the sarcophagi before taking them in specially constructed wooden crates to the National Museum of Rome to be studied . The five sarcophagi included a larger one for a mother and father and smaller ones for children . The largest held the remains of a 25- to 30-year-old man . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine years old . The wife 's body was missing and Musco thinks the broken sarcophagus in the other tomb may have held her remains , suggesting she died after her husband and children . Musco admits that when he first opened the parents ' sarcophagus , he was a bit disappointed , imagining that there would be grave goods inside . " I hoped that the man would have a ring on his finger that would attest to his high rank in society , " he says . Such a ring would normally be found on the finger of a noble , senator , or high-ranking official . " But since it was absent , " Musco adds , " I do not think this was a noble family ; he was not a consul or a magistrate . This family was tied to commercial production--they were rich enough to have a good burial , but not well off enough to include a lot of items in their sarcophagi . " <p> Musco 's team kept looking . In the sarcophagus of one of the children , probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parts of a second doll , and a pair of child 's gold earrings . Fewer than 10 ivory dolls have been found in Italy from the entire Roman imperial period , and according to Maria Rosaria Barbera of the Archaeological Superintendency of Rome , this doll is particularly refined because it would have had movable limbs . It is also the latest Roman doll of such quality ever found . Ancient Roman dolls , like modern Barbie dolls , represent adult females , with hairstyles that imitate those of the imperial family , allowing Barbera to date the doll to the Severan age ( A.D. 193-235 ) . Because of high infant mortality rates in antiquity and a generally less sentimental view toward children than we have today , burials with valuable artifacts from a child 's life are extremely rare . Often items made from precious materials such as ivory would usually be passed on rather than buried with a deceased child . The other children 's sarcophagi were empty but for their bones . According to ancient-toy expert Emilia Talamo , the presence of the ivory dolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who was buried in the sarcophagi ? About a quarter-mile from the tombs are the remains of an ancient villa rustica , including walls that date the villa to the first century B.C. , wells , and irrigation channels . There were two types of villas in the Roman countryside--residential villas , where aristocrats spent time away from the city , and villae rusticae , working farms that produced fresh goods for the city . The extensive water supply makes it clear that the one at Tor Cervara was not a leisure property . " The people buried in the sarcophagi could have been the family connected to the villa . Perhaps they were the last members of a line who had lived in this area for a long time , at least from the first century B.C. to the third century A.D. , " says Musco . <p> The remains are currently being studied in both a laboratory belonging to the scientific investigative unit of the Carabinieri ( military police ) and another one supervised by David Caramelli of the University of Florence , an expert in ancient DNA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of preservation--like the sarcophagi , they were damaged by high acid levels in the ground . Giampietro Lago , the director of the investigative unit 's biology section , adds that there is a large risk of exchanging modern DNA from people handling the bones before they came to the lab . But Musco and Caramelli hope that with both teams working on the DNA , and with the police 's experience with complex crime scenes , they will eventually be able to identify the gender of the children , the family relationships between the deceased , and the causes of death . <p> Meanwhile , the sarcophagi are on display in the National Museum of Rome , which Musco visits from time to time . " I never forget that I have a mystery to solve about the identity of these people , " he says . " Sometimes I really think of them as my family . My dream would be to at least give them a name .

##4080550 Kai Bird 's formative years in the Middle East were not exactly the stuff of Leave It to Beaver : he learned to check his shoes every morning for scorpions ; had to negotiate Jordanian , UN , and Israeli checkpoints on his way to school ; went to sleep on occasion to the rat-a-tat-tat of machine guns ; was evacuated from East Jerusalem to Beirut during the 1956 Suez War , and again from Cairo to Greece in the 1967 war ; and had a girlfriend whose jetliner was hijacked and blown up by Palestinian terrorists in 1970 . Oh , and his mother used to play Joan Baez and Bob Dylan songs on the guitar in her Riyadh home with Salem bin Laden , Osama 's older brother . That 's fodder enough for an engrossing memoir . But Bird has loftier goals . A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has made a career of going mano a mano with the dead white males of the eastern Establishment , he wrote this book " in large part to understand why the Middle East of my childhood seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossing Mandelbaum Gate is a gesture of atonement for a stone left unturned : for much of his career , Bird pointedly avoided grappling with the region . The book also encompasses Bird 's attempt to confront larger questions of identity , whether those embedded in the cultural miscegenations of the modern Middle East or those embedded in the jumbled allegiances of a boy plucked out of Oregon to tag along in the baggage train of Pax Americana . I can understand the inclination to avoid reckoning with the Middle East . Even as a Foreign Service Officer , and later as the executive editor of Foreign Policy magazine , I thought of the strife between Israel and its neighbors as a second-tier incubus that sapped the energy and attention of American policymakers and an intractable , insiders-only dispute that defied rational discussion . Bird 's book has n't entirely cured me of that view . But with its engaging and insightful reminiscences of growing up in Jerusalem , Dhahran , and Cairo , its sharp portraits of half-forgotten figures like Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett ( whose diplomatic efforts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bird 's own quest to make peace with his past , Crossing Mandelbaum Gate is a compelling corrective that can force even reluctant readers to look at the Middle East anew . One of the book 's more powerful aspects is its evocation of the Nakba , or " catastrophe , " the term that Palestinians use to describe their uprooting with the foundation of Israel . Bird 's family moved in 1956 to East Jerusalem , then under Jordanian control , where his father , Eugene , was an American vice consul . While his parents had friends and acquaintances on both sides of the line dividing Jerusalem -- the book 's title comes from the single open crossing -- they felt keenly the plight of the Palestinians , many of whom had been ousted from their homes in 1948 . As Bird 's mother wrote in 1957 , " I feel no sympathy for Zionism whatsoever and none for the Israeli society . " For Bird , the losers of Israeli independence were not faceless refugees , but people like his family doctor , a Christian , Arabic-speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken over by Israelis . In one of the book 's more poignant moments , Bird recounts the story the doctor tells when , a half-century later , he returns as an American citizen with his daughters to visit his old house . An Israeli woman living there , knowing the neighborhood story of how the doctor had planted an apricot seed as a young child , hands him a fruit from that tree . Bird also usefully highlights the tangled and in many ways toxic history of relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia . When his family moved to Dhahran in 1962 , they joined 2,500 Americans ( almost all of them members of the Arabian American Oil Company , or ARAMCO ) , who represented the largest single community of Americans overseas , complete with bowling alleys , swimming pools , Girl Scout troops , Little League teams , and hootch stills in every pantry . As one longtime resident observed , " Dhahran was a utopia . " But the presence of so many cloistered Americans , who generally were more of the ugly than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that was long before Osama bin Laden began inveighing against the kingdom 's decision to welcome tens of thousands of American troops in the run-up to the Gulf War . ) Moreover , as Bird makes clear , the U.S. tendency in its relationship with Saudi Arabia to put oil before democracy , and to side with royalists over reformers , " would lead to many unsavory consequences for ... both the Americans and the Saudis . " In May 2007 , Bird visited his old compound in Dhahran . The four-foot rock wall that once surrounded it had grown to 15 feet . Gurkhas patrolled the perimeter , protected by machine guns and security gates : " My childhood home -- where I had once freely wandered in and out , completely unsupervised , a child unfettered -- was now an armed fortress under siege . " As Bird sees it , the failure to support reform in Saudi Arabia is one of many U.S. missteps in the region . Others include the U.S. reneging on its promise to help fund Egypt 's Aswan Dam and , more damningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preemptive strike on Egypt in 1967 , which Bird labels a " calamity " for the United States . The war not only led to the expulsion of 24,000 American expatriates across the Middle East and massive anti-American demonstrations , but also weakened secular leaders like Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and paved the way for the ascendancy of political Islam . But many of the " what-might-have-beens " that Bird singles out rightly involve regional protagonists -- everyone from Nasser to lesser-known figures like Abdullah Tariki , the progressive Saudi petroleum minister who helped create OPEC but was forced into exile when he accused Crown Prince Faisal of corruption , or like Hillel Kook , the iconoclastic ex-Irgun member who fought in his later years to turn Israel into a secular Hebrew Republic . Some of Bird 's historical narrative may at times feel potted , but his explorations of such characters illuminate the complexity of circumstances on the ground .. In one of the last segments of the book , Bird provides a convincing rejoinder to those who may feel that his pro-Palestinian sympathies blind him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Jewish wife 's parents , who both barely escaped the Holocaust in Austria and Italy ; is as gripping as it is moving . As Bird later points out , it is the inability of both Israelis and Palestinians to overcome their competing sense of historical victimhood that ultimately sustains the current impasse . But Bird stretches poetic license past the plausible when he calls the Nakba and the Shoah " the bookends of my life . " ( A la Tonto , a Palestinian and a Jew might say , " What do you mean ' your life , ' white man ? " ) And he gets a bit carried away with the powers of insight supposedly Conferred on him as an expatriate . ( " It is given to him to see both sides , " he intones of himself as a child -- a sentiment that I never attained or aspired to in more than a decade living overseas , including a chunk of my childhood in Japan . ) Still , give him credit for having written a powerful and unflinching book . Crossing Mandelbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's most troubled neighborhoods , but it at least brings understanding a little closer .

##4080552 I am standing in a room containing enlarged photographic portraits of about a dozen children , each labeled by name plus other identifying details obviously provided by relatives . One label tells about Francine , age 12 . Favorite sport : swimming ; favorite food : eggs and chips ; best friend , her elder sister Claudette ; cause of death : hacked by machete . Several displays describe the final moments of siblings . Killed by a " grenade thrown in their shower " where they were hiding , reads one label . A woman sobs in the next room ; there , spotlights direct the eye to display cases containing skulls in rows and leg bones in piles . Over the sound system , a woman murmurs something mournful over and over in Kinyarwanda , the language of Rwanda . I step out into the sunshine . Today is my second full day in Rwanda , and I am visiting the Kigali Genocide Memorial on a hill overlooking Rwanda 's capital city of Kigali . I have come here as part of a research project on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oslo , Norway . During my stay , I will interview representatives of local nongovernmental organizations , international development agencies , human-rights groups , reconciliation specialists , and private citizens . The Kigali memorial features a garden where a flame burns to commemorate the 100 days in 1994 when Hutu killers murdered 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hum . I had expected something dramatic at the mass graves of the murdered Tutsi . Instead , the graves are unremarkable large slabs of concrete bordered by lush garden plantings of roses , hibiscus , and birds of paradise . Perhaps 60 Rwandans , all dressed formally , pass by . Some carry small bouquets of roses , some wear purple ribbons on their chests -- the official color for genocide commemoration . Most of the women wear elaborate ankle-length , traditional dresses and head wrappings made from colorful geometric-patterned fabric . I erroneously assume they are part of a tour group . Down a walkway I catch sight of a young man carrying a cross and behind him six other men carrying a coffin draped in a purple cloth . About 25 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps toward a wide dirt field : a mass grave . While a new American embassy was under construction in Kigali -- it opened in February 2008 -- workers discovered the remains of a dozen or so genocide victims on the site . Those remains , like others still being found in the city and nearby a decade and a half after the mass killings , are brought here for burial . More than 250,000 people are interred at this , the main national memorial . As you would expect , the memorial landscape is somber , and visitors speak in hushed , respectful tones . Still , I can only manage to view the memorial with a certain feeling of remove . Despite more than 10 years of research into the politics of the genocide , I find it almost impossible to conceive of the horrors of the killings and the hatred that propelled them . Intolerance and hostility in Rwanda date at least from 1918 , when Belgium colonialists arrived and accorded the Tutsi favored status , deeming them to be racially superior to the Hutu . Three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutsi king . Once in power , the oppressive Hutu government engaged in periodic killing campaigns against the Tutsi minority , causing hundreds of thousands to flee the country . In 1990 , an army of Tutsi exiles invaded from Uganda and nearly toppled the government . Both parties reluctantly signed a United Nations-brokered peace deal in 1993 . During the lull in fighting , Hutu leaders meticulously planned the genocide , launching their mass killing program in April 1994 . Today , the Hutu make up 85 percent of the population ; the Tutsi just 14 percent . With the exception of genocide survivors , who were all Tutsi , the people I encountered were reticent to identify themselves as Hutu or Tutsi , probably because of laws restricting discussion of ethnicity . My driver , Mr. Jean , a middle-aged man with an honest face and a strong inclination toward gospel music , asks if I saw the entire memorial . " Yes , " I answer , " and it made me very sad . " " Now you have seen our big mistake , our big mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this , and I ca n't ask for clarification became I speak little French . We speed along dusty streets thronged with people who are shopping , visiting friends , waiting for a minibus . Mr. Jean delivers me to my hotel in time for dinner . Alone , I am absorbed in Dostoyevsky . I wonder if the great Russian could have imagined someone reading The Brothers Karamazov in such a place . In his story , the young aspiring monk , Alyosha , fervently claims , " There 's a great deal of love in mankind , an almost Christ-like love . I know that myself , Ivan . " The embittered older brother responds , " Well , I know nothing of it so far , and ca n't understand it , and the mass of mankind are with me there . The question is , whether this lack of ability to love is due to men 's bad qualities or whether it 's inherent in their nature . " Later in Ivan 's story , the Grand Inquisitor accuses Christ : " But Thou didst think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , though rebellious by nature . Look round and judge ; fifteen centuries have passed , look upon them . ... I swear , man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou has believed him ! " ( The Anglican Archbishop of Rwanda , Emmanuel Kolini , later echoes the Grand Inquisitor when he tells me that the genocide highlighted the " weakness of mankind . " He laments that during the buildup to the killing , people were " walking away slowly from God . " ) The day after I visit the memorial , I meet with a UN worker and describe what I had witnessed . She says the government strongly encourages families to disinter their loved ones and reinter them in the mass graves , even if the family members would prefer not to . The government also recently adopted the terminology the genocide of the Tutsi rather than Rwandan genocide . What does this say to the families of the politically moderate Hutu who perished ? Subsequently , a pastor tells me that the phrase is accurate : The Hutu victims were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutsi , not because of their Hutu identity . Still , I wonder . During the genocide , an army of Tutsi exiles swept in from neighboring Uganda , defeated the killers , and took over the government . In the ensuing 15 years , the minority Tutsi government , called the Rwandan Patriotic Front and led by President Paul Kagame , has made strides in improving infrastructure , health , and the economy . Every Rwandan I meet shows great pride in the country -- both its natural beauty and its remarkable recovery . Recovery has come at a cost , however . The Kagame regime has extended its control to every aspect of the country . To discuss ethnicity or to question the official interpretation of the genocide is to risk a prison sentence if the government labels such speech as divisionist . Press freedom barely exists . Many insist that such strict measures are necessary to prevent future atrocities ; how can you have a one-person , one-vote democracy when the majority tried to eliminate the minority and nearly succeeded ? Others whisper that the country is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . The ostentatious wealth of a tiny minority of government officials and business people makes an ugly , perhaps dangerous , contrast to the poverty of most Rwandans , including Tutsi survivors of the genocide . " No one knows what will happen if Kagame takes his foot off the brake , " a U.S. government official admits to me . I am sitting on my hotel balcony on Sunday morning three days after my arrival . From a Catholic church somewhere beyond the garden comes the sound of robust , a cappella , harmonic singing . Set to words in Kinyarwanda , the singing has been going on , almost uninterrupted , for four hours , and I wonder what prompts such religious fervor and what it signifies . Is it a cathartic experience ? How has it changed since the genocide ? Officially , Rwanda is said to be 56 percent Roman Catholic , 26 percent Protestant , 11 percent Adventist , and 5 percent Muslim , but some Protestants insist that Catholics really represent no more than 40 percent . I ride by the church of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that many people perished there . The priest colluded with the killers , Anatole says , and then escaped and is now living in France . I know that Catholics are generally viewed by government partisans as complicit in the genocide . Despite the political indelicacy , I ask those I meet how someone could hack a neighbor to death with a machete . Everyone at first expresses moral incomprehension . Many Protestants elaborate with references to the devil , or the spirit of evil , as a motivation for the genocide . They cope with the horror by isolating the evil spirit from the perpetrator . Archbishop Kolini , with whom I spoke in his office at the Anglican cathedral in Kigali , said that before and during the genocide , " the church opened the door to the devil . " But , he adds , people have a choice about saying no to the spirit of evil ; Satan is not an excuse . Here again , Dostoyevsky has something to contribute . In the novel , Ivan converses with the devil , who has taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In explaining the problem of evil , the devil dryly observes that " Nothing human is beyond the possibility of Satan . " As a follow-up to my machete question , I ask Rwandans " Who is human ? " Some of the answers trouble me . Archbishop Kolini interprets Saint Paul to claim that one must have love to be human and that , through repentance and reconciliation , perpetrators can " become human . " But that implies that there is a category of people who are not human . I receive a more universalist answer from Pastor Antoine , an Anglican priest who survived the genocide . We sit in a churchyard , where he is participating in a reconciliation training session for clergy , and he explains that all people on the planet are fully human and must recognize the humanity in each other , even though it might be more psychologically palatable to describe , for instance , a sadistic rape and murder as inhuman , animalistic , or monstrous . Reconciliation . I repeatedly encounter the word in Rwanda . Researchers write about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is reconciliation and how do we know it when we see it ? The term is overused . From nonprofit organizations and church groups , I hear heartwarming and astonishing stories about mothers of murdered children forgiving the killers , rape victims absolving their attackers , genocide survivors marrying perpetrators . I suspect that these remarkable reconciliations represent a very small proportion of the traumatized population . Widespread reconciliation is not imminent . Yet my cynicism dissipates when I meet Christians who devote their lives to increasing that minuscule number of healed and reconciled people . Josephine , a gentle , soft-spoken woman who founded an organization that trains church members in trauma healing , is one of them . She tells me she lost many loved ones in the genocide and yet refuses to pass judgment on perpetrators or to build a hierarchy of suffering . In contrast , other Rwandans make disturbing comparisons such as She was raped and her child was killed , whereas this one was only raped . Even if Josephine represents a minority of one , her compassion offers a precious example to Rwandans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jean and I make an excursion to another genocide memorial . This one is a Catholic church in the small town of Ntarama , about 20 miles outside Kigali . Along the road , women carry on their backs sleepy babies , snugly wrapped in bright-patterned cotton . Men , women , and children tote bundles of bananas , large sacks of grain , loads of firewood on their heads . Children in blue school uniforms run and play close -- very close -- to the road . Arriving at Ntarama , we read a sign explaining that 5,000 Tutsi perished in the small church and surrounding territory where they had flocked for sanctuary . Inside , daylight filters dimly through small , high windows . As my eyes adjust to the light , I can make out wooden benches , about eight inches off the ground , that had served as pews . Hanging from the walls and rafters are the tattered , bloodstained clothes of the victims ; their bones are arranged on shelves . Rows and rows of skulls predominate . Some of the skulls are tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite wall are the possessions the victims had brought with them to their refuge , including mattresses , cooking pots , utensils . Above the bones , a sign in Kinyarwanda reads , " If you knew me , and you knew yourself , you would not kill me . " I methodically take photos from several angles , sign the guest book , make a donation , and wonder at my own lack of emotion . After about 30 minutes , we leave . The shock wears off the next day , a Sunday . Again on my balcony , I hear the voices from the neighboring church . The music grows more ardent : drums beat , congregants clap rhythmically , women launch into an African-style descant . I shut my eyes and again see the rows of skulls and the pitiful collection of cooking pots , shoes , and blankets piled in the corner . The fervent churchgoers , both Tutsi and Hutu , have lived through the genocide experience , I realize . Every day , they live with their own particular memories of the horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the director of a Christian reconciliation organization , tells me about still another genocide memorial , at the town of Murambi , a couple of hours south of Kigali . He and all his family lived there in 1994 . As the genocide began , the government requested villagers from nearby to come for protection to the Murambi school . Leaders claimed that they could n't protect the Tutsi from the killers if they were scattered in the countryside , so people came voluntarily , trusting the government . Michel 's entire family was there . During the night of April 21 , the military , supported by Hum locals , attacked the school with guns and grenades . All who tried to escape were hacked to death . According to the Rwandan government , 27,000 Tutsi were murdered . The following day , the government brought in bulldozers to pile up the bodies and bury them , a clean-up operation that created a mountain of corpses , most of which were left basically intact . You could still identify individuals . The 800 bodies at the Murambi genocide memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lime , so that the victims stayed in the exact position in which they died -- for example , warding off a blow . Michel must have been elsewhere at the time or he would have been killed . I do n't ask . I will be driving near Murambi , but I wo n't visit . Each genocide memorial seems to outdo the other in horror , and I am feeling creepy about the possibility of becoming a genocide tourist . Some human rights groups object to gruesome displays like Murambi , saying they stir up hate toward Hutu residents . Indeed , Hutus , notably children left homeless because their parents are imprisoned , receive no sympathy or assistance . Their shame and poverty is met with indifference . And there are hundreds of thousands of Hutu who experienced the hell of the refugee camps in Zaire and are treated with suspicion .

##4080558 Here are three essays dealing with computers . I intend that to sound sort of like " here are three essays dealing with ritual " or " here are three essays dealing with kinship " -- to sound as if it were entirely unsurprising to open up a copy of Anthropological Quarterly and see three essays about computers , alongside three on social organization , religion , or pragmatics and ideology . It should be entirely unremarkable by now that computers are involved in the social and cultural life of the people and processes anthropologists study , everywhere in the world ( digital divides notwithstanding ) . It should be clear by now that the interactions and uses by which people make meaning , act , or build societies is as inextricably linked to software , networks , computers , devices , and infrastructures as we insist it is to kinship or social organization . In all honesty , we should be well past the time when we need labels such as " digital life " or " the anthropology of the virtual " or " online sociality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , it will not do to simply suggest that computers make no difference to the social and cultural lives of humans , and that we ought to go on as if information and communication technologies are simply a diacritical mark on otherwise fundamental features of human life . On the other hand , it can not change everything . The requirement to say what difference computers make to things like sociality , knowledge , language , or human life in general is not met by appending the word " digital " to whatever noun or verb commands more immediate attention ; but nor can the difference be approached as if it were one problem among many , parceled out after the fashion of area studies , or divvied up as if it were one qualifying field exam alongside others ( which we nonetheless know to be a frequent occurrence ) . Often such a problem can only be addressed by demonstration , and this is what makes the three essays gathered here so valuable . Each of them is , in its own subtle way , struggling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards anthropology , yet bring it to bear on a problem whose significance is widely felt , over-analyzed , and poorly understood . The essays collected here do not seek to forge a new subfield , or to simply apply anthropological concepts to new objects like Facebook friends or cell-phone users ; they do not seek to radically reinvent the methods , fieldsites , or topics of anthropology ; and despite being written by people immersed in the technical details of software and networks , they are not any more inter- or trans-disciplinary than many other anthropological studies underway today . Instead , what they do is something that should be familiar to any anthropologist : they form concepts out of rich empirical fieldwork and try to rectify them against those realities . They criticize approaches to problems and concepts forged in other places and in other times ; and in doing so they leave open the possibility for future criticism that might take account of the changing technical conditions of our world ( Strathern 2006 ) . Each delivers good ethnographic value , explicating and orienting readers to very specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case what difference the difference engine makes . This is not special or new in any threatening sense ; rather it is simply what anthropology looks like today . These three essays each take on one of the peculiar burdens of anthropology : the ongoing remediation of the concept of culture . Culture , as a concept and as a feature of anthropological thought is both broken and yet impossible to leave behind . Within the discipline , it has been through so many changes , so much re-use and modification , and so much critique , that it seems impossible to see in it the distinctive form it might once have had ; and yet , there are no other serious nominees for the position it holds . Even more burdensome is the fact that all around anthropology , other disciplines wield this concept ( and the associated claim to investigate it via ethnography ) with abandon . Much of this work is conducted without much awareness of its peculiar failings , difficulties , and critiques . In information studies , in management , in consumer research , in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salience and a power it seemingly no longer possesses for scholars trained in the heart of anthropology . But even more troubling , very little of this work shows a grasp of the particular strengths of the concept either . Analyses of the " culture " of computing or the internet , to say nothing of its appearance in every microlocation from corporations and gymnasiums to gorilla troupes and hair salons , seem empty of theoretical force , barely distinguishable from norms and customs in some 19th century sense ; such analyses certainly almost never attain the heights of systematicity or recursivity we associate with the exemplary works of the discipline . The burden these essays bear is therefore a double one : first , to show that the objects of study chosen are adequate to some concept of culture , and second , to transform that concept in ways that will ( one hopes ) influence and remediate the ways neighboring disciplines employ and rely on this complicated notion . These articles all try to preserve the cultural at the expense of cultures -- by finding diverse ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as a constitutive dimension of human life , as one of the planes -- an open plane , to be sure -- of which it is always composed " ( Rabinow et al . 2008:106 ) . But they also raise the stakes for this concept by struggling with the question of how to work over the manifest importance of software , networks , and computers without going too far . There is obviously no shortage of work on this topic : the range of disciplines and methods brought to bear on the topics of information technology , computers , software , and networks is disturbingly large . One should ask : why is there so much written on this topic ? Then one should ask : why is so little of it any good ? In part , the answer is that , for some reason -- call it a cultural reason -- we are driven to see computerization and its incumbent technologies and social formations as so profoundly cutting-edge , so new , so revolutionary , that we lose sight of what might really be new about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing new about them but scale and speed -- is just as much a part of this cultural reason . Both the Californian enthusiasm of the technophile and the Edwardian reserve of the technophobe seem to signal the disappearance of any sufficiently rigorous concept of culture -- even as the repetition of the term and the proliferation of its sites seem to go on unhindered . Or to put it differently : why are both computers and cultures everywhere today ? In anthropology , studies of online interaction , virtual worlds , and computer-mediated communication have , over the years , made various moves towards thinking through the concept of culture , but not much theoretical work has emerged . There are the widely read reviews by Escobar et al . ( 1994 ) and by Wilson and Peterson ( 2002 ) , and seminal works by Miller and Slater ( 2000 ) and Hine ( 2000 ) ; and there is an increasingly large set of works in media anthropology that focus on the use of discussion , online interaction , and communication as part of larger issues like diaspora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Axel 2004 ; Barker 2008 ; Bernal 2005 ; Larkin 2008 ; Lysloff 2003 ; Ginsburg , Abu-Lughod , and Larkin 2002 ) . Of the theoretical works in anthropology that provide a basis for rethinking the concept of culture , Michael M.J. Fischer 's article " Worlding Cyberspace , " more than any other , attempted to move the discussion towards worlding as a way to distinguish it from bounded space and placebased versions of culture ( Fischer 1999 ) . The essays here continue what Fischer initiated , especially Golub 's contribution , which very clearly positions its approach as a general attempt to understand how worlds of any kind form , in order to gain purchase on the question of what difference the computer makes to this process . Beyond this limited list there are plenty of contributions to the " ethnography of online communities " -- but few I would suggest that push forward the theoretical and conceptual challenges of understanding both the proliferation of studies of computing , and their inability to account for this proliferation culturally . The three essays collected here should therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of them emerge from the heart of anthropology ( all graduates of the University of Chicago no less ) , and all of them are erudite , widely read scholars with extensive fieldwork experience in more than one area . That they have turned their attention to the issues explored here is no doubt connected to the general cultural desire to understand the meaning of computers , but it also emerges from a deep engagement with some of the central strengths and weaknesses of the anthropological analysis of culture . It is worth trying to bring these out a bit more sharply here . There are a series of moves towards specifying the role of the cultural addressed in these essays . There is a first move involved in trying to achieve purchase on these new phenomena , and that is to literally make up a new culture . This is something to which Golub objects in studies of the " virtual worlds " where the success of past anthropology is used to legitimate the treatment of virtual worlds as bounded wholes -- places with local everyday life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not there . Such a move is not wrong methodologically -- however , it creates an expectation , or hypothesis , that these worlds are both separate from and similar to the realclothes worlds we have always studied . This move generally excuses researchers from having to look closely at the distributed inhabitants in their real-clothes bodies ( which is admittedly time-consuming and painstaking work that does not feel very new ) and also from the necessity of engaging with the technical and economic conditions of possibility for these worlds ( which it must also be admitted , can take some of the fun , though not the interest , out of researching them ) . Rather than seeing virtual worlds and online environments as built on top of or extruded from existing worlds , organized in particular ways , much of the work in online ethnography both inside and outside of anthropology prefers to make up a culture instead , often implicitly , without giving it much thought . Only Tom Boellstorff 's recent book makes an explicit experiment of this move , reflecting on the implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Boellstorff 2008 ) . And it is in making an experiment of it that it is possible to attempt to hold apart the methodological decision from the epistemological ( or ontological ) claims that might be made about these worlds . A great deal of non-ethnographic work , for instance , relies on just this kind of confusion in order to treat online worlds and games as " laboratories of human behavior " ( e.g. the work of Edward Castronova ) . However , as Golub points out here , virtual worlds are built out of existing ones , and the previously existing actual worlds are necessary but not sufficient grounds for the emergence of the new " virtual " worlds -- which is to say , they are not a simple mirror or iteration of general human culture . And despite the manifest excitement with which scholars have approached these cases as novel and interesting , few seem to have actually taken on the task of characterizing this novelty -- this supplementary or extra " worlding " that takes place -- and instead have treated it as a variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There is a second move in the analysis of online , networked cultural life , which is to return to behaviors and practices as themselves constitutive of a fieldsite . Here , it is not the boundedness of space or place that gives meaning to everyday life , but the nature of mediated interaction itself . In part , this is what Coleman attempts to capture through the analysis of hacker sociality . This move happens in opposition to the first one , invoking the necessity of looking at the dual sociality created by mediated communication -- both online and in person -- as that which makes it distinctive . In this respect , the camps and conferences that are a frequent feature of hacker 's lives ( and which are spreading to other domains as well ) are an effect of this dual sociality and not a face-to-face practice that precedes it . The " cultural " plane of hacking therefore is not place/spacebased but a zone of pragmatic stability that emerges out of multiple modes of interaction . These stabilities of practice are sustained and repeated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple modalities of communication and collaboration involved in creating software and networks . Hence , the object of " hacker sociality " comes to look similar in form to objects like rituals , carnivals , or feasts ( and thus the turn to theorists like Turner and Bakhtin as resources for understanding them ) . The question remains , however , what difference does online software-mediated interaction make to this formation of pragmatic stabilities ? Coleman answers that it is the very details of technical practice -- hacking , coding , designing , tinkering , writing licenses -- which provides the content of these ritual-like pragmatic stabilities , and hence remediates the cultural as something endemic to ( and located only in the practices of ) this community of individuals . Finally there is a third and lateral move , which is away from culture and towards " social imaginaries . " A focus on social imaginaries ( especially those such as the public sphere and the economy ) at first rejects the " cultural " as a meaningful word , but without sacrificing the complex combination of ideal and material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many cultures ( each distinct ) , social imaginaries come in only a handful of historically ramified forms tethered to global secular modernity of the last 400 years or so ( Taylor 2004 , Kelty 2008 ) . A focus on " social imaginaries " as a replacement for culture can then be employed to analyze public spheres , democratic deliberation , and diasporic identities , both in person and via new media technologies . Such a move can push analysis so far beyond the question of information technology that it disappears or ends up making little or no difference to the case under consideration . Frequently this leads people to ask , for instance , whether the Internet is a public sphere ( usually in the sense given by Habermas ) or whether new forms of political speech ( blogging , chat , IM , Twitter ) change the dynamics of mass media politics , frame issues in new ways , and include , or exclude , people in new ways . Such questions are obviously productive , but they ignore the specificity -- the cultural specificity -- of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominic Boyer 's piece demonstrates , the analysis of social imaginaries really only gets interesting when some version of the cultural is retained . Understanding the production and movement of social imaginaries itself requires a cultural analysis of the people , practices , places , and techniques that make them go . Practices of journalistic knowledge-making are a crucial component of the formation of imaginaries and are themselves under assault from the very proliferation of information technologies , software , and networks . It is the cultural features of journalism that structure the way an imaginary of the public sphere takes shape -- not just the content that circulates , as we say , " in the public sphere . " New technological possibilities , disastrous financial arrangements , and new forms of writing , blogging , tweeting , and chatting are all transforming the organizations , the life-worlds , and the practices of the people who make journalistic knowledge and make it circulate . It is therefore incumbent on us ( anthropologists , as well as the journalists in Boyer 's account ) to ask how this reformed consciousness determines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words that circulate , or by the ( recursive ) technological layers that give it form , but also by the self-understanding of the actors who occupy it . What at first might seem a contradiction -- that social imaginaries replace the concept of culture , yet analyses of social imaginaries are only interesting when they retain a cultural analysis -- is in my understanding a response to the other two moves : making up worlds and treating embodied techniques and practices as the site of culture . For a cultural analysis to work , there must be more at stake in understanding the role of networked information technologies than simply treating them as one more kind of place where human behavior occurs , or as one more form of life among many . Rather , the technical and epistemic practices of well-chosen groups of people -- journalists in Boyer 's case -- must be explored if one wants to understand the difference that new technologies make to human behavior . Indeed , it is Boyer who comes closest to embarking on a cultural understanding of the ubiquity of attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cybernetic-informatic consciousness " that he uses to link journalists and anthropologists together opens a door to understanding why computers and cultures are equally everywhere today -- and maybe for some surprising reasons that have a lot to do with the mid-century successes of both cybernetics and anthropology . Cybernetics ' fortunes look a lot like culture 's -- overused , diffuse , heavily critiqued , yet nonetheless compelling in their most rigorous forms . Cybernetics ' dissemination looks a lot like culture 's -- taken up across nearly every discipline , attenuated by circulation , unpoliced by classic disciplinary modes of ownership and exclusion . One might re-think , therefore , the critiques of ethnographic authority in the 1980s through this lens . They can be read not as critiques of the culture concept , or of the pretensions to scientificity ( they certainly were in some quarters ) , but as critiques of the authority of the concept of culture ( or of science more generally ) . What these critiques proposed was the impossibility of authoritative knowledge about the social world ; what they brought about was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point real , authority of the concept of culture . It is for this reason that these essays should be seen as part of a project of reconstruction -- not only of the concept of culture , but of culture and computers together . If some analysis of the cultural is still central here -- both to anthropology and to a rich understanding of the transformation of the world by information technology -- then it might just be that these essays are at the cutting edge , not for their focus on technology , but for their stubborn insistence on saving and refining the concept of the cultural itself . What is also clear , however , is that such a task is intimately tied to the practice of anthropological fieldwork and that each of these papers in different ways seeks to demonstrate the difficult work that is necessary for the concept of culture to be of any use at all . There is , for instance , a difference between really studying the lifeworld of hackers , as they live and breath , and simply treating them as cloistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , which is nonetheless both very interesting and not easy to elicit ) . There is a difference between playing an online game once or twice and writing an essay about that experience , and spending two years creating two level 80 healers , raiding on weekends , and developing strong emotional bonds with a collection of other game-players in order to understand the nature of action and worlding . There is a difference between reading a bit of Habermas and loudly proclaiming the epochal changes wrought on our public sphere by the decline of newspapers and actually talking to journalists about their practices . Golub 's contribution , for instance , does not shy away from the details of World of Warcraft , the way many articles by lawyers do ( just to pick on those who can take it ) . Legal analysis of these games eschews detailed description , either because it seems way too geeky to do so , or more likely because it is seen as irrelevant to the argument being made ( which in many circles of legal studies today is a deliberately thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Golub must demonstrate the details of this lifeworld in order to make his case that players in WoW deliberately break down and limit the sensory aspects of the game in order to achieve other goals . What he demonstrates thereby is not the sensory realism of these games , but their social realism -- the ways in which the game facilitates , and perhaps transforms , affectively intense social bonds . Coleman 's contribution does something similar , by showing in detail the nature of hacker embodiment and sociality across both the lived experience of the conference or hacker camp and the everyday interaction online . This analysis of conferences as an innovation of virtuality , not something that precedes them , has general applicability . It has long been true of scientific and scholarly fields ( Diana Crane 's famous " invisible colleges " and the essential role of the scientific congress and yearly conferences ) , but is now also true of many other fields , from security guards to struggling musicians , where people develop social bonds according to professional and work affinities , not geographical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congresses , and festivals to enhance their careers and make new relationships , to experience fun and exhaustion , and to enhance storytelling and history-making . It will be only a matter of time before Facebook conferences emerge in the same fashion -- not as a re-connection of old friends , but as a new form of cultural life . Do we still need a " digital " anthropology to understand such a transformation ? Yes and no . In the end , it may be that ( as Boyer suggests ) anthropologists have been thinking through these issues along -- at least since Gregory and Mary were invited to the Macy conferences , if not beginning with Boas . Computer programmers are fond of the saying : " Garbage in , Garbage out . " It 's a way of saying that no matter how carefully or precisely one focuses on the computer itself , if one puts bad data in , one will get bad data out . The same might be true of anthropology . If the problem of culture and the cultural remains anthropology 's most lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culture in , Culture out " should be our mantra and our warning .

##4080566 ON FIRST IMPRESSION , the temple-fortress complex of Chankillo seems like the result of bad ideas and an extreme surplus of free time . From the outside it appears to be defending nothing more important than a sandy hillside where northern Peru 's Atacama Desert meets the Andes . The Casma River runs down the valley floor three-quarters of a mile away , giving life to a vein of green vegetation in the unrelenting beige of the desert . More than 2,000 years ago , the people living nearby left their villages to build three concentric walls totaling more than a mile in length , some of them 30 feet high and more than 20 feet thick , around a stone temple devoted to the sun . Any modern general would have been severely disappointed in Chankillo 's fortifications . The difficulties of defending the place seem so great that some archaeologists have questioned whether it was a fortress at all . The first problem is that despite being on a hill , Chankillo does not command the high ground . The hilltop is northwest of the fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sling stones onto defenders manning the fortress 's outer walls with little fear of counterattack . Second , the fort has no source of water or place to store food during a siege . As if that is n't enough , the outer wall has five gates to defend , and the second and third walls each have four gates . Rather than putting these entrances in places where the terrain is steep or difficult to cross , they are located where it is easiest to walk or run up the hillside . The temple at Chankillo was built sometime between 400 and 200 B.C. , around the same time a religion that seemed to unify the region was starting to decline . The Chavn cult was first identified at the ancient city of Chavn de Huntar 75 miles east . The cult may have provided a politically stabilizing influence throughout much of northern Peru . As the religion lost its influence , however , localized groups began developing independent religions and probably political systems as well . " The collapse of Chavn ... may have been followed by increased conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontificia Universidad Catlica del Peru . " Combat and weaponry were known before , but only at this time does conflict rise to the scale of true warfare . " It was the beginning of the end of a time period Andean archaeologists call the Early Horizon . Very little is known about the people who built Chankillo . Not much archaeology has taken place outside the fortress , and the villages where the builders lived have not yet been discovered . But like many people from across northern Peru at this time , they began to feel threatened by neighboring groups and built hill forts . Those forts , however , are often located in places that would not have protected their crops or homes . Chankillo and other Early Horizon fortresses are raising questions about the use of violence in ancient Andean societies . GHEZZI LEADS ME TO a gate in the complex 's outer wall . Even as the wind scours me with grains of sand and the sun threatens to peel the ears off my head , I can at least be glad that I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 100 pounds , as people did thousands of times to build the fortress walls . Ghezzi has been excavating Chankillo since 2001 and through his investigation he has developed some surprising insights into how these buildings were used . " I think you have to turn around and think of the gates as defense mechanisms and not weaknesses , " says Ghezzi . " The gates contain an element of surprise . " He leads me through one of them . It is basically a narrow tunnel in the 20-foot-thick wall . As we exit the gate , we are confronted by another wall and a choice of turning left or right into a narrow passage where defenders could hurl stones or spears onto us from parapets above . Anyone making it out of the corridor would end up in a no man 's land between the first and second walls with no options but retreating or running along the wall to attack the next gate . Ghezzi believes that Chankillo was a temple first and a fortress second . The location of the gates would have allowed easy access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations so that the complex could be defended by a relatively small number of warriors . A small number of clay figurines discovered at the site gives Ghezzi a clear picture of the equipment that the warriors at Chankillo used . The figurines are about six inches tall and wear crescent-shaped ornaments in their noses . Their necks and shoulders are covered with striped cloth . The way the figurines are decorated makes it easy to imagine that pageantry was an important aspect of battles fought here . Andean warriors protected themselves with quilted tunics and rectangular shields , and armed themselves with spears and spear-throwers , slings , and maces with stone heads . " The technology of warfare developed quickly , much like in the rest of the world , but then remained stable for a very , very long period , " says Ghezzi . Andean cultures never invented the techniques necessary to make iron and bronze , which probably limited the development of new and deadlier weapons . " The weaponry that an Inca warrior carried is very similar in general terms to that of a Moche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lack of a water source at the site might also be an important indicator of the way wars were fought in this region . " You are going to have to store a lot of water out there if you are going to garrison Chankillo , " says John Topic , an expert on Andean warfare at Trent University in Ontario , Canada . " Maybe you do n't garrison these things and when you want a battle you arrange it . " Ghezzi agrees that the strategies and tactics of warfare at Chankillo and other fortresses dating to the same time period were probably influenced by the religion and cosmology of these ancient civilizations . Conquest probably meant something entirely different to the rulers of Chankillo than it does to people today . " It does n't seem as though the control of territory is the actual purpose , " says Ghezzi . " The focus seems to be on controlling the main symbols of society as they are expressed through ceremonial architecture . " The purpose of the fighting at Chankillo may have been to capture and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in the Casma Valley . " In much later periods in the Andes , the control of populations was far more important than the control of any other resource , " says Ghezzi . " It 's an economy that has no money ; therefore , access to labor is the most important thing . " Being able to control holy places and the gods who occupied them provided rulers with the means to control people and their labor because they could intercede with gods to ensure better harvests and more wealth for the community . According to Ghezzi , warfare between two groups was seen not as a battle between men , but a struggle between gods . " The battle is a representation of who has a stronger god , and the one who has the stronger god then has the right to dominate the losing society , " says Ghezzi . Ritual warfare was common among the Inca , according to historic accounts , and ritual combat called tinku battles still take place in certain parts of the Andes . Tinku battles are fought between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same or related communities . " If you win , your group is better , " says Topic . " If you win consistently , people will find ways to change their allegiance from one side to another . " The architecture at Chankillo may indicate that the community that used the fort separated itself into moieties . " At Chankillo , inside those walls there are two separate towers that are side by side but are separate from each other . " In the past , people were killed during tinku battles and their deaths were believed to serve an important purpose . " The universe consists of multiple levels , and energy flows from one level to another and it 's that flow of energy that keeps the world functioning . That flux of energy requires death , " says Topic . The Quechua word " tinku " refers to the meeting of two complementary halves to create a larger whole . It can refer to the confluence of two rivers , the pairing of a man and woman , or , in this case , the joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors in battle are engaged in an almost sexual act where the product is death , in much the same way that a man and a woman have sex to produce a new life . " People are participating in warfare , in part , to reproduce the world , " says Topic . The practice of ritual warfare such as tinku battles has probably changed over the past 2,400 years , but Ghezzi believes that it provides a good general framework for the methods and motivations of warfare at Chankillo . " Perhaps it was n't necessary to have a confrontation of two armies , " says Ghezzi . " Perhaps it was a confrontation of relatively small groups for the possession of these religious centers or even the religious artifacts contained in them , and if that is captured then the defeat is conceded and the victorious party gains access to labor , probably some kind of taxation , women , or the right to control this or that resource .... You go to the head and then you control the rest of society . " If the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than another , sneak attacks and siege warfare might have been counterproductive . How does one god defeat another if only one side shows up to the fight ? Staged battles may have been necessary to gain a legitimate right to rule over a group of people , and that was probably the most important thing for societies where vast amounts of labor were necessary for creating food and wealth . According to Ghezzi , " the territory without the population is worthless . " WE MAKE OUR WAY across the rubble-filled spaces between the walls , moving through two more gates on our way to the buildings at the heart of the temple-fortress to see what made Chankillo a place worth defending . The remains of two round buildings , which Ghezzi has not yet excavated , occupy the hilltop . South of them lies a 21,500-square-foot pile of rubble that was probably the spiritual center of an entire culture . The bases of massive stone pillars still rise out of the pile , so Ghezzi named the building the Temple of the Pillars . Far below us , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise with 13 rectangular towers on top of it looking like a row of teeth badly in need of braces . The remains of square buildings lie to the east and west of the ridge . Ghezzi interprets the buildings as observatories with the towers on the ridge serving as an artificial horizon . The line of the towers curves in a way that makes only 12 of them visible from the eastern observatory . Ghezzi has determined that standing in the observatory and marking the place where the setting sun crosses the line of towers would allow priests to divide the year into 12 months lasting 28 days , which would correspond with the time between full moons . To make this calendar of lunar months correspond with the solar year , a 13th month needs to be added every fourth year . To do that , the astronomer priests at Chankillo would move to the western observatory where all 13 towers are visible and mark the passing days by watching the rising sun cross the line of towers . Ghezzi points out a small notch in the temple wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notch aligns with the towers and the observatories . On the summer solstice the sun would set behind the temple , aligning with the notch in the wall and the gap between the 12th and 13th towers , indicating the date had a special significance for the people of Chankillo . This astronomical alignment may have been what made the temple 's location so important . The ability to control the calendar -- in effect , controlling time -- could have provided a source of power for whoever ruled Chankillo . Unlike the round buildings , the temple floor is covered by an evenly spread layer of stones from the collapsed walls and fallen pillars . The footing is treacherous enough that we walk along the remains of the temple walls . When the walls of Chankillo were finally breached the attackers took special care to destroy the temple thoroughly . " Destroying a ceremonial site may have been a way of destroying the legitimacy of a group , " says Elizabeth Arkush , an Andean warfare expert at the University of Virginia . The conquest of the temple not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed an entire faith . " Very often when you captured a deity or a sacred place you waited a while and you saw what happened .

##4080568 The full moon casts a warm glow across the dirt plaza of Ranchos de Taos and the adobe walls of the church of Saint Francis of Assisi , made famous by the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe . Inside the parish hall , archaeologist Sunday Eiselt of Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) faces a small crowd . She 's a little nervous . Eiselt is about to ask the residents of this conservative Hispanic community near Taos , New Mexico , for permission to dig up their backyards and the floors of their centuries-old homes . Today , the area is known as a ski town and a magnet for both the super-rich and hippie artists , but the community was founded in the 17th century , and is one of the oldest in the country . " We 're not here to dig and leave " Eiselt says once the audience is settled . " We want you to tell us where to look and what to look for . " She emphasizes that the Taos Collaborative Archaeology Project can only move forward with the community 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project is part of a broad-based effort to investigate the history of Taos ( see " Whiskey Rebellion " page 42 ) . Locals begin to ask questions about the excavations and eventually offer suggestions on where to look . Father Francis Malley , the parish priest , promises to announce the project in next week 's mass and put it in the church bulletin . Everyone is enthusiastic , which probably has something to do with the project 's surprising goal : instead of ancient ceramics or prehistoric fire pits , Eiselt and her SMU students are looking for toys . Some of the discoveries they 've already made cover a folding table in the back of the room : jacks and marbles , a doll 's head , part of a tiny teacup , a gray Lego plank . Residents gather around when the meeting is over and point out items they recognize . One woman identifies a scrap of gauzy fabric as a doll 's veil . " We did n't have dolls until the 1960s , " she says . " We used homemade toys before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lives have changed in the past 150 years , the project is revealing an often overlooked aspect of society and showing that " Barbie dolls and bubble gum wrappers can be part of archaeology , too , " says Eiselt . She is interested in how the introduction of American consumer culture and a changing educational system affected the lives of Hispanic children in the area , where Catholic and Presbyterian parochial schools existed alongside American public schools/The introduction of American wage labor economies in the early 20th century brought many economic benefits , but at a cost , " she says . It also changed the way children were raised , and this should show up in children 's material culture over time . A purely historical approach to this change is n't enough , Eiselt says . " Archival documents pertaining to children are selective , " and written by adults with their own biases toward children , especially their own . Archaeology contributes a different perspective by looking at the objects children actually interacted with , as well as direct evidence of their activities . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " active cultural agents who can have major influences on society . " THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF CHILDHOOD is a very new field , " says Jane Eva Baxter of DePaul University 's Department of Anthropology , one of the few experts on the subject . In the past , archaeologists have seen children as passive recipients of culture , and assumed they were either invisible in the archaeological record or a source of randomizing " noise " that distorts adult patterns ( an idea with which many parents would agree ) . But concentrating on children " forces us to question our own assumptions about the past in ways that adult archaeology does n't , " says Baxter . Rethinking assumptions about who contributes to a culture is a positive shift , she adds , considering that people under the age of 15 , one common definition of childhood , make up about a third of most cultural groups . Previous archaeological investigations into childhood have involved reexamining sites excavated for other purposes . Baxter herself has examined toys , clothing , and other related items excavated from 19th-century American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada , and a plantation in Jefferson Parish , Louisiana , among others . She wrote the first archaeological dissertation focused on children . Her work shows that children 's behaviors leave identifiable patterns in the archaeological record through the distribution of child-specific artifacts . For example , the grouping of toys at some sites showed that kids had specific places to play , some where adults could watch them and others out of sight . Boys ' and girls ' toys were more segregated in urban environments , suggesting children played separately , while the toys were more mixed in rural settings . Baxter says Eiselt 's project may be the first excavation to focus explicitly on childhood . " One way society creates value is through kids , how they 're treated and raised , " Eiselt says . " They can tell us things we ca n't get otherwise . " Children 's tendency to accept new technologies and push the bounds of tradition more readily than adults is n't just a modern phenomenon . Archaeologists are just starting to recognize that children are a source of innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect how we understand technological and social change over time . This is especially useful in understanding the culture of northern New Mexico , where Native American , Hispanic , and Anglo populations have mixed and clashed for centuries , and where many children are the product of the blended society that results . Eiselt 's project encompasses Ranchos de Taos and three other tiny communities , mainly Hispanic , that surround Saint Francis . She first came to the Taos area to study the relations between Native Americans and Hispanics , but when her initial test pits resulted in a surprising number of toys , she decided to change her focus . Excavations are now geared toward investigating the two cornerstones of childhood : school and play . IN 2008 AND 2009 , students excavated at two houses . One , on the Ranchos de Taos plaza , belongs to Guadalupe Tafoya , executive director of the Questa Chamber of Commerce . The other , in the nearby community of Talpa , is owned by her brother , Felipe . By Guadalupe Tafoya 's estimate , her family has lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tree-ring dates from her home 's ceiling beams go back to 1827 . The houses packed-earth floors yielded hundreds of childhood artifacts dating at least to the 19th century , including miniature versions of stone tools used to grind wheat or corn . A handmade clay horse still bears the mark of a tiny fingernail , and may even be prehistoric , but most of the items date to the 20th century , from Depression-era train wheels to an eye from a stuffed animal and a doll-sized set of binoculars . Fragments of crayons , chalk , and pencil lead suggest art and education became part of play at home . Child-care relics include diaper pins , a strainer spoon , and a small bottle that once held Skuft Shine for Children 's Shoes . Tafoya endorses the project wholeheartedly , even if it means large holes in her living room floor for weeks at a time . " I think it 's very important , " she says . " Children are not recognized for their contributions to society . But you learn about a society or culture through children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kids . " In excavation units outside Tafoya 's home , students found plastic coins , a bicycle pedal , and a cowboy pendant , probably from a necklace . They also excavated about 20 community dump sites scattered around the study area . A metal toy gun , pieces of a plastic rocking horse , and a red Power Rangers figure show how toys have evolved through the 20th century . " In many cases , we can date them to specific years based on the manufacturing dates provided by the toy companies , " Eiselt says . It 's already clear that kids in Taos had more toys in the modern era , starting in the 1950s . Children in the 19th century had few toys , almost all homemade , or they went without . In the mid-20th century , manufactured toys and other children 's goods flooded Taos , in large part through the secular education system . Many Anglo schoolteachers were from outside the community . " They brought new songs and games and toys to occupy children during recess , " says Eiselt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was instituted , the children played with clay , corn husks , and flowers . Communal toys and games such as jacks and marbles were gradually replaced by toys allowing more solo play , such as with dolls and Legos . This may reflect a larger shift in the economy of the area , in which children moved from being members of a rural workforce to more educated , individualized , and indulged roles within the family , with more leisure time . The 1950s were a period of great change in this isolated community . In the midst of a postwar boom , the economy was shifting from rural agriculture to wage labor . Both the availability of affordable plastic toys and the arrival of department stores to replace mail-order catalogs and locally run stores affected children directly . " Basically , I think we 're documenting what happens when ' modernity ' hits a village and starts affecting how children are raised , " Eiselt says . To deduce the cultural effects , she says , it 's essential to consider the cultural models children 's items embody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a message . Look at Barbie -- she 's not just a doll . She 's an icon of feminine beauty , which acknowledges a narrow range of feminine ideals . " With a little sleuthing , one student traced a truck wheel to a company whose motto was " Structo Toys Make Men Out of Boys . " One of the greatest effects of modern changes at Ranchos de Taos was the homogenization of the educational system . Although parents welcomed the arrival of Anglo schools , they also fought -- unsuccessfully , it turned out -- for control of what and how their children were taught . Eiselt hopes that excavations at the Saint Francis of Assisi Catholic parish school , which closed in 2006 , will clarify her hypothesis that the institutionalization of education began a process that parents today would recognize : the gradual convergence of education and entertainment , the start of the era of " edutainment . " If she and her team find a number of toys at the school they might be able to track an increasing link between education and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study is looking less and less valid , Eiselt says . " Our work will show that it is complex but not impossible to study children , and that new perspectives on cultural contact and change are possible through the study of children 's lives . " Kids ' play is n't pointless and random , she says . It 's an opportunity to act out adult roles , and it can shape attitudes that are carried into adulthood . By looking at childhood directly , archaeologists hope to complement historical accounts and create a richer picture of a crucial but overlooked segment of society . " Children do n't write their own memoirs , " Eiselt says . " We think they have something to say . " She is already amazed at how the community has embraced the project . " Anything relating to childhood has some sort of magical , instant appeal . Everyone relates to it . Everyone was a child once .

##4088950 Culture &; Civilization </p> pre-formatted table ONCE philosophers , theologians , and poets asked the question : What is man ? These days , cognitive scientists have taken over the job . Want to know what makes humans unique -- why we create music , worship God , fall in love , provide for our children , feel despair ? Ask the brain scientist . Earlier modern revolutions in human understanding made their leaders and explicators world famous , even to those who had no idea what those leaders and explicators were talking about -- think of Freud or Einstein . That kind of fame has not yet come to the captains of the cognitive revolution , as cognoscenti sometimes refer to the transformation in scientific thinking about the human mind . The wider public , the same sort of people who once tossed about the terms " Oedipus complex " and " theory of relativity " after reading about them in Time , is largely unaware of the cognitive revolution . </p> The field is often said to have originated in the 1950s , when the linguist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules giving us the ability to generate infinite numbers of phrases and sentences . But it took decades of methodological and technological advances -- the MRI machine , which gives scientists the power to watch the brain in action , came into wide use only in the 1990s-for the field to gain a real cultural presence . Public ignorance of the brain theorists in their midst can also be chalked up to the fact that cognitive science is not a single , unified discipline . It encompasses ethology , evolutionary psychology , computer science , neuroscience , behavioral economics , anthropology , and even chemistry . </p> And finally , not many people who understand the amygdala and hypothalamus also write about them in ways the public can understand , much less enjoy . Most of what we hear on the subject veers between impenetrable academic papers and gee-whiz , **33;33197;TOOLONG enthusiasm . ( As I write , the American Museum of Natural History in New York is advertising an exhibit called " Brain : The Inside Story . " " Play Computer Brain Games ! ... Walk Through a Giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Oliver Sacks , Malcolm Gladwell , and Jonah Lehrer ( the author of Proust Was a Neuroscientist ) -- who have written gracefully and knowledgeably about cognitive science . But their work hardly adds up to a cohesive picture of the field . </p> David Brooks 's new book , The Social Animal , tries to fill that gap and offer a thoroughgoing portrait of what brain science can tell us about contemporary American culture and politics . Brooks , the New York Times columnist and author of two previous books of " comic sociology , " is not entirely successful at the hugely ambitious task he has set for himself ; it 's hard to imagine anyone who could be . Nevertheless , he has written a fascinating interpretation of a discipline with immense power over our current way of thinking . </p> Brooks is especially interested in what cognitive science can tell us about success and happiness in our own society . To explore that question -- and to keep us scientifically challenged readers happy -- he attempts his own experiment , a literary one . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with a test case in the upbringing , education , and development of a fictional couple named Harold and Erica , blessedly successful members of America 's educated class . </p> Harold grows up in a stable , loving home , gets a degree in global economics and foreign relations , runs a historical society , writes commercially successful biographies and histories , and works for a D.C. think tank . Despite a mentally unstable single mother , Erica will start her own consultancy business , become the CEO of a media company , and take a high-level staff position for a successful presidential candidate . Brooks may take things too far when he has her become secretary of commerce , but you get the idea : these are meritocratic stars . </p> What can the cognitive revolution tell us about people like this ? Brooks begins by reviewing infant brain development . Adapted by millions of years of evolution , the infant brain intuits patterns and creates models out of the galaxies of sensory data exploding around him . This learning is an actual physical process . The baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through connections called synapses . Humans develop hundreds of trillions of those synapses ; one scientist imagines them as " a football stadium filled with spaghetti . " The neurons store information . This means that experience is actually written into the baby 's -- in this case , Harold 's -- brain . </p> Yet for all his innate cleverness , child Harold is a bit of a wild man . He is easily distracted and bounces from one thought to another like one of his rubber balls . This is where nurture makes the difference . The bedtimes , the daily routines , and the nightly homework insisted upon by a determined mother teach Harold the orderliness and self-control that will bring him success in school and in life . His parents are well-off , but they do n't just provide him with computers and private schools ; as Brooks demonstrates in detail , " they pass down habits , knowledge , and cognitive traits . " </p> Indeed , like all humans , Harold and Erica are " social animals . " By this , Brooks means something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . The brain is actually molded by interactions with other people . Human infants are born with " mirror neurons " ; that 's why babies imitate the faces and sounds of those around them . Infants also internalize the attentiveness of their mothers . In the 1950s , the British psychologist John Bowl-by theorized that children of mothers attuned to their own moods are more resilient and develop greater capacity for emotional bonds , and there is now abundant research suggesting they are more likely to thrive as students , spouses , and parents . Parents themselves unconsciously imitate the patterns of their own childhood , patterns that have been handed down over generations . Erica 's mother 's family is Chinese , for instance , while her father 's is Mexican . They do not explicitly teach the girl their values and different habits of sociability ; but unconsciously , Erica so successfully assimilates these attitudes that they come to feel as natural as breathing . </p> In Brooks 's telling , then , cognitive science yields a brain nothing like the mechanical and autonomous information processor stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline influenced by artificial intelligence . Humans are inevitably and beneficially guided by emotions and unconscious associations . Most of us already suspect that subterranean life drives our sexual and romantic desires . Experts fill in the details . When encountering the opposite sex , hormones like testosterone and oxytocin bathe our brains ; when we fall in love , we get high on dopamine , much the way addicts do on cocaine . Cognitive scientists believe because we are driven by a brain adapted to the early human environment , men equate female beauty and " fertility cues " -- symmetrical features , full lips , and a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 , the approximate dimensions of both Playboy bunnies and prehistoric fertility goddesses . Since men can tend towards violence and promiscuity , women are less visual and more guarded when choosing a mate . Both women and men prefer kindness in a spouse , but women are aroused by male status -- though Brooks does not apply this rule to Erica , whose ambition and achievements far exceed her husband 's . </p> Unconscious feelings are not limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb through the world of business and politics , Brooks is sharply critical of technocrats , planners , management experts , IQ hawks , and even writers of the French Enlightenment for their excessive faith in human rationality and calculation . Reason is not like a " captain sitting in the cockpit making decisions , " he writes . Moral emotions and intuitions , some of them innate , some of them a product of individual experience , some primitive , some culturally adaptive , saturate the most methodical decisions . Policymakers generally fail to factor in subjective life . Experts have assumed we could educate kids about the risks of drugs and unprotected sex , for instance , so they could make " good decisions . " But the good decider " has rigged the game " ; her judgment is already infused with moral leanings that reduce temptation . </p> Brooks wields his trademark comic sociology to mock modern society for overvaluing professional achievement and academic prestige . In one hilarious riff , he describes " the Immortals , " older plutocrats who ride mountain bikes on roads near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beautiful younger women . The result is a " weird genetic phenomenon in which their grandmothers looked like Gertrude Stein but their granddaughters looked like Uma Thurman . " Our heroes , Harold and Erica , are better than this . The aging Erica realizes that her ambition has made her neglect the " deeper " sides of herself , and so she sets out to educate her emotions , traveling , listening to music , reading novels , and ( in another stretch ) taking up woodworking . Pondering his life , the elderly Harold is humbled to recognize that he , that is , " the voice in his head , " the knowing , conscious self , is as much servant as master of his being and that the individual is part of a " never-ending interpenetration of souls . " </p> In other words , Brooks sees cognitive science as a source of wisdom about who we are and how to live . What is man ? He is genes and hormones and ever-firing synapses , to be sure . But he is also evolved emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologians view man as locked in a battle between reason and emotion , civilization and instinct , society and the individual , or as Freud might have put it , the conscious and the unconscious , the ego and the id . The Social Animal concludes that these conflicts are illusory . Instead , reason is informed by moral emotions , civilization channels instinct , culture sculpts the individual , and the unconscious educates the conscious . Human flourishing is not found by the triumph of one side over the other ; happiness is holistic . Likewise , Brooks sees no necessary divide between science and religion . " The brain was physical meat , " Harold , his mouthpiece , realizes in his last days , " but out of the billions of energy pulses emerged spirit and soul ... . The hand of God must be there . " </p> This final observation will doubtless make some scientists ' brains explode , to choose a relevant metaphor . The scientific community has not always greeted Brooks 's columns on the kinder , gentler , and more spiritual brain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political animus , or genuine misinterpretation on the layman 's part is hard to determine . Suffice it to say that his approach to the field is unusual . Cognitive scientists are almost by definition materialists ; many of them believe that the brain 's evolved physical activity puts an end to the idea of a soul . It 's no accident that a number of today 's most vociferous atheists are comrades in the cognitive revolution . Sam Harris is a neuroscientist , Richard Dawkins an evolutionary biologist , and Daniel Dennett a philosopher much influenced by cognitive studies . </p> Some criticism of The Social Animal will be deserved , regardless of the book 's scientific accuracy . Brooks 's novelistic format tries to marry humanities and science , but the experiment has mixed results . At its less satisfying moments , The Social Animal reads like the 4 a.m. mind-racing of an idiosyncratic honors grad student ; using insight from cognitive science , he expounds on love , politics , Plato , charter schools , Coleridge , Alexander Hamilton , the intensity of life in the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative method Brooks has chosen leads him to gloss over uncertainty . Cognitive science is a young , changing discipline subject to human error and ambition ; only recently , a Harvard evolutionary biologist has been accused of fabricating data about animal cognition . More generally , some research cited in the book might follow thousands of subjects over a period of years , while others ask a series of questions of a couple of dozen college students on a single afternoon . Brooks does n't warn us about the latter . </p> Perhaps the field 's greatest uncertainty is the question of how brain activity relates to consciousness , or the mind/body problem . Scientists can explain how different parts of the brain operate when we perceive , think , remember , or desire . They can watch those parts of the brain in action . What they ca n't do is tell us how all that activity adds up to an " I , " a unified , aware self . Through Harold and Erica , Brooks avoids confronting this failure . Creative license gives him the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </p> Cognitive science is radically reshaping the way we think about ourselves , and The Social Animal offers unique insight -- and comfort -- about the conclusions it draws . </p> KAY HYMOWITZ is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute .

##4088951 CONSERVATIVES , ELITES , AND POPULISM </p> ON FEBRUARY 19 , 2009 , when the finance commentator Rick Santelli indulged in a rant against the newly unveiled " stimulus " bill on the CNBC cable network and called for a demonstration in Chicago modeled on the Boston Tea Party , he fired a shot heard round the country . Santelli 's diatribe was focused on the fact that Americans who had played by the rules , had saved much of what they had earned , and had paid their bills on time were being required to bail out fellow citizens who had gotten caught short in purchasing a domicile they could not afford or while speculating in real estate . In the weeks that followed , ordinary citizens spontaneously gathered in towns and cities across the continent to organize Tea Parties in protest against what they took to be an unjust redistribution of wealth from the industrious and the rational to the greedy and improvident . The mainstream media treated them with contempt , and most Republicans kept their distance . Leading Democrats denounced them as frauds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the president of the United States used the obscene epithet " teabaggers " to refer to them , however , the adherents of what was coming to be a full-fledged movement -- the Tea Party movement -- stood firm . And in the course of the summer of 2009 , as Americans began to grow fearful of the scope and intrusiveness of the Obama administration 's health-care proposal , that movement 's numbers grew . In August 2009 , when congressmen and senators held town halls to discuss the proposed bill , ordinary Americans showed up in droves ; and , to the evident dismay of their representatives , they bluntly spoke their minds . </p> By January 2010 , when the unknown Republican Scott Brown defeated the well-known Democrat Martha Coakley in the Massachusetts race for the seat in the Senate once occupied by Ted Kennedy , it was clear that the Tea Party movement was destined to become a powerful force not only within the Republican Party but in the country as a whole , and patronage-minded Republican senators and congressmen who hoped to be re-elected in 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not quick to do so soon came under fire . A three-term senator from Utah who failed to take note was denied his party 's nomination for re-election at the state 's Republican convention . A senator from Alaska , the scion of an entrenched political dynasty and a member of the Republican leadership , suffered the same fate in her party primary . In Delaware , a popular nine-term congressman who had served two terms as governor lost his party 's senatorial primary to an insurgent who had never held political office . In Kentucky , the same fate met its secretary of state . In Florida , a former-state senator came from nowhere ( the first poll had him at three percent ) to force a popular sitting governor to abandon his quest for the Republican senatorial nomination . And in the Republican senatorial primaries in Colorado and Nevada , Tea Party-backed insurgents defeated a lieutenant governor and a former party chairman . </p> It is perfectly understandable that Republican regulars were thwarted in the primaries , that Democrats were defeated in the midterm elections , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political influence should find these developments disconcerting . It is equally understandable that those who find unpalatable either the Tea Parry 's approach or some of the more colorful and/or questionable candidates to emerge victorious as a consequence of its rise might consider this leaderless and inchoate force 's impact worrisome or even frightening . In point of fact , however , this sort of upheaval is nothing new . Such forces have risen periodically throughout the history of the United States and have their antecedents in 17th- and 18th-century England . </p> IN HIS 1748 Spirit of Laws , the great political philosopher Montesquieu attributed the recurring turmoil that had long beset England to the separation of powers between the executive and the legislature . The Tudors for the most part had been able to sidestep the problem in the 16th century because Henry VIII and his children had sufficient wealth in the lands he had seized from the Catholic Church to cover most of their needs . But their Stuart successors in the 17th century found that those resources had been largely exhausted ; and to cover their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were compelled to have frequent recourse to Parliament for revenue . </p> To their dismay and that of their ministers , what soon came to be called " the Country " rose up in high dudgeon time and time again to denounce on the floor of the House of Commons what was perceived as favoritism , corruption , arbitrary rule , conspiracy , and papist predilections on the part of a Court thought to be intent on encroaching on the rights of ordinary Englishmen and the prerogatives possessed by Parliament . These tensions produced the English civil war of the 1640s , the execution of Charles I in 1648 , the rule of the Rump Parliament and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell in the 1640s and 1650s , followed by the Restoration of the monarchy in 1658 , which was in turn followed 30 years later by the Glorious Revolution . </p> By the time Montesquieu arrived in England , things had settled down . The political tensions that had periodically given rise to turbulence and bloodshed were now being resolved peacefully through electioneering and balloting , and monarchs now found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence of Parliament and were not simply tools of the Crown . </p> Montesquieu found the dynamics of English politics both instructive and amusing . " The hatred " that had long existed between Court and Country he regarded as a permanent feature . This hatred " would endure , " he observed , " because it would always be powerless , " and it would be powerless because " the parties " inspired by the separation of powers would be " composed of free men " who would be inclined to switch sides if either the executive power or the legislative power appeared to have " secured too much . " </p> The English were a commercial people who lived in what Montesquieu called " a republic concealed under the form of a monarchy . " The regime under which they were reared , being neither republican in the classical sense nor genuinely monarchical , did little to inculcate in them a spirit of self-sacrifice and even less to inspire in them a love of honor and glory . Instead , it left Englishmen to their own devices ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succumb to the restlessness and anxiety that Montesquieu called inquietude . In such a nation , he remarked , the charges lodged by the party that stood in opposition to the executive branch " would augment even more " than usual " the terrors " to which a people so disposed were naturally prone , for they " would never know really whether they were in danger or not . " </p> Ordinarily the legislature , which enjoyed the confidence of the people , would be in a position to moderate their fears . " In this fashion , " Montesquieu noted , when " the terrors impressed " on the populace lacked " a certain object , they would produce nothing but vain clamors &; name-calling ; &; they would have this good effect : that they would stretch all the springs of government &; render the citizens attentive . " </p> And if the terrors fanned by the party opposed to the English executive were ever " to appear on the occasion of an overturning of the fundamental laws , " he observed , " they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , one would see a frightful calm , during which the whole would unite itself against the power violating the laws . " </p> Moreover , he added , if such " disputes took shape on the occasion of a violation of the fundamental laws , &; if a foreign power appeared , " as happened when the arrival of the Dutch political and military leader William of Orange in 1688 triggered the Glorious Revolution , " there would be a revolution , which would change neither the form of the government nor its constitution : for the revolutions to which liberty gives shape are nothing but a confirmation of liberty . " </p> Over the past generation , historians have tended to interpret the American Revolution similarly as a clash between Court and Country . The pattern described by Montesquieu was duplicated in colonies such as Virginia , Maryland , Massachusetts , and New York in the 17th and 18th centuries . Moreover , the charges leveled against King and Parliament by the American colonists in the period stretching from 1762 to 1776 were a compendium of those lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ; the opponents of the Long Parliament , the Rump Parliament , and Oliver Cromwell ; the proponents of the Glorious Revolution ; and those who subsequently became disgruntled under the rule of William of Orange following his installation as William III and the creation of William and Mary , Anne , and their Hanoverian successors George I , George II , and George III . </p> The same pattern manifested itself also in the political disputes that followed the founding of the United States . To be sure , when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison organized the first American political party , they did not accuse Alexander Hamilton and those who came to be called the Federalists of papist predilections . But they did assert that the economic program proposed by Hamilton in his capacity as George Washington 's secretary of the treasury amounted to a conspiracy to overthrow republicanism in America and consolidate power in the hands of an irresponsible executive indistinguishable from a monarch . That is why Jefferson spoke of the election of 1800 and his own ascendancy to the presidency as a second American revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up against the so-called " Tariff of Abominations " shortly after its passage in 1828 . Andrew Jackson articulated much the same argument in the battle he undertook in his second presidential term ( 1832-36 ) against Nicholas Biddle 's proposal for a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States , and so did Abraham Lincoln and his fellow Republicans in their quest in the late 1850s against what they called " the slave-power conspiracy . " </p> One could hear echoes of these earlier controversies in the campaign mounted against the railroads and banks by the People 's Party in 1892 ( the force widely considered the originator of what has come to be called " populism " ) , in the presidential campaign undertaken by the insurgent Democrat William Jennings Bryan in 1896 against the tight-money fiscal policies that he said were crucifying America on a " cross of gold , " and in Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's assertion at the Democratic Convention in 1936 that " a small group " of economic royalists was intent on concentrating " into their own hands an almost complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , other people 's labor-other people 's lives . " And , of course , it is a similar suspicion that has given rise to the Tea Party movement . </p> Consider what Barack Obama and the Democrats did over the past two years -- with their so-called stimulus , health-care reform , and reform of financial regulation . Each initiative involved the passage of a bill more than a thousand pages in length that virtually no one voting on could have read , and no one but those who framed it could have understood . Each involved a massive expansion of the federal government and massive payoffs to favored constituencies . And each was part of a much larger project openly pursued by self-styled progressives in the course of the last century and aimed at concentrating in the hands of " a small group " of putative experts " an almost complete control over other people 's property , other people 's money , other people 's labor -- other people 's lives . " Without quite knowing whom they are evoking , Tea Partiers are inclined to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not put a stop to what is going on , " for too many of us life " will be " no longer free " and " liberty no longer real " -- for otherwise the bureaucratic busybodies ensconced in Washington will deprive us of the means by which to " follow the pursuit of happiness " as we see fit . </p> The only difference is that FDR 's assertions demonizing the " economic royalists " were demonstrably false , and when the Tea Partiers make comparable claims today , they are , alas , telling the truth . </p> American liberty is more fragile than we are inclined to suppose . The Framers of the Constitution were well aware that the republics of ancient Greece and those of medieval and early modern Italy were situated on diminutive territories . They knew that Rome 's expansion had eventuated in Rome 's loss of liberty , and they understood why Montesquieu had initially argued that a republic could not be sustained on an extended territory . A government set at a considerable distance from the people over whom it rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight and out of mind , beyond reach and beyond control . This the Framers understood . They took heart , however , from the French philosopher 's suggestion that a federation of small republics could overcome this geographical imperative . They were reassured by his tacit acknowledgement that , by way of the separation of powers , the " republic concealed under the form of a monarchy " that had emerged in Great Britain had overcome this imperative as well . And they themselves observed that the religious and economic diversity that had followed from America 's territorial extension were successfully subverting the force of faction . </p> In the early 1790s , however , when James Madison began thinking about the political consequences inherent in the ambitious program of economic development charted by Alexander Hamilton , he had occasion to reconsider Montesquieu 's warning . He believed that " a consolidation of the States into one government " was implicit in Hamilton 's assertion of federal prerogatives . And he feared that such a consolidation would neutralize the expedients suggested by Montesquieu and instituted by the Framers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , which , it must be owned , is the natural propensity of every government . " </p> First , Madison thought , the separation of powers could give way to centralized administration of the sort that typified despotism . If federalism were subverted in this way and the national government by one means or another took over the prerogatives of the states and the localities , the legislature situated in the new nation 's capital would quickly prove to be incompetent " to regulate all the various objects belonging to the local governments , " and this " would evidently force a transfer of many of " those objects " to the executive department . " </p> Second , Madison contended , because the state and local governments are close to the people -- in sight and in mind , within reach and control -- they and not the federal government are the natural instruments of civic agency . If , however , they were made to be dependent on and subject to the national government , they would cease to serve this function , and the sheer size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular political action . It would prevent the exercise of " that control " on the national legislature " which is essential to a faithful discharge of its trust , since neither the voice nor the sense of ten or twenty millions of people , spread through so many latitudes as are comprehended within the United States , could ever be combined or called into effect , if deprived of those local organs , through which both can now be conveyed . " In such circumstances , Madison warned prophetically , " the impossibility of acting together , might be succeeded by the inefficacy of partial expressions of the public mind , and this at length , by a universal silence and insensibility . " It was the absence of effective popular checks that would leave the national government to a " self directed course " </p> Madison , Jefferson , and their heirs in the Jacksonian period were arguably wrong about the political consequences implicit in the program proposed by Hamilton in the 1790s and revived by Henry Clay in the late 1820s . Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American System , and that policy did not have the consequences that Madison , his associates , and their heirs feared . But the prospect that Madison imagined is , in fact , the prospect the world 's most venerable democratic republic now faces . </p> Over almost a century , under the influence of the Progressives and their heirs -- the proponents of the New Deal , the Great Society , and Barack Obama 's New Foundation -- we have experienced a gradual consolidation of power in the federal government . Legislative responsibilities have been transferred to administrative agencies lodged within the executive -- such as the Environmental Protection Agency , the Federal Communications Commission , and the vast array of bodies established under the recent healthcare reform -- and these have been delegated in an ever increasing number of spheres the authority to issue rules and regulations that have the force of law . </p> In the process , the state and local governments have become dependent on federal largesse , which always comes with strings attached in the form of funded or unfunded " mandates " designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic agency , rooted as it normally is in locality , has withered as the localities have lost their leverage . The civic associations so admired by Alexis de Tocqueville have for the most part become lobbying operations with offices in Washington focused on influencing federal policy , and many of them have also become recipients of government grants and reliable **34;33232;TOOLONG of federal policy . </p> The Tea Party movement is , however , testimony to the fact that all is not lost . When confronted in a brazen fashion with the tyrannical impulse underpinning the administrative state , ordinary Americans from all walks of life are still capable of fighting back . It is easy enough to mock . Like all spontaneous popular movements , the Tea Party has attracted its fair share of cranks : it would have been a miracle if it had not attracted those who are obsessed with the question of Barack Obama 's birth certificate or the heavy-handed and ineffective procedures adopted by the Transportation Security Agency . </p> BUT IT should be reassuring rather than frightening to the American elite that at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous and watchful when a presidential candidate who has presented himself to the public as a moderate devotee of bipartisanship intent on eliminating waste in federal programs suddenly endorses " spreading the wealth around " and on the eve of his election speaks of " fundamentally transforming America . " It should be of comfort to them that a small-business owner in Nebraska believes he has reason to express public qualms when a prospective White House chief of staff , in the midst of an economic downturn , announces that the new administration is not about to ' let a serious crisis go to waste " and that it intends to exploit that crisis as " an opportunity to do things you could n't do before . " And it should be a source of pride to elites that the philosophical superstructure of the United States demonstrated extraordinary durability when a significant number of their fellow citizens refused to sit silent after an administration implied the inadequacy of the founding by promoting itself as the New Foundation , and after the head of government specifically questioned the special place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " </p> Most important , it should be humbling to those elites that ordinary American citizens choose spontaneously to enter the political arena in droves , concert opposition , speak up in a forthright manner , and oust a host of entrenched office holders when they learn that a system of punitive taxation is in the offing , when they are repeatedly told what they know to be false -- that , under the new health-care system that the administration is intent on establishing , benefits will be extended and costs reduced and no one will lose the coverage he already has -- and when they discover that Medicare is to be gutted , that medical care is to be rationed , and that citizens who have no desire to purchase health insurance are going to be forced to do so . </p> In 1776 , when George Mason drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights , he included a provision reflecting what the revolutionaries had learned from the long period of struggle between Court and Country in England and in America : " that no free government , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by a firm adherence to justice , moderation , temperance , frugality , and virtue and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles . " What we are witnessing with the Tea Party movement is one of the periodic recurrences to fundamental principles that typify and revivify the American experiment in self-government . </p> These developments are never exclusively salutary . The people sometimes err , as Montesquieu understood and as , I believe , has happened with considerable frequency in our nation 's past . But as Thomas Jefferson observed in the wake of the rebellion mounted by Daniel Shays in 1786 , if the " turbulence " to which popular government is " subject " is regrettable , " even this evil is productive of good . It prevents the degeneracy of government , and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs . " In Europe , Jefferson explained , " under the pretence of government , they have divided their nations into two classes , wolves and sheep . " He feared that the same would in time happen in America . If the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , you and I , " he wrote to one correspondent , " and Congress and Assemblies , judges and governors shall all become wolves . " </p> From the outset , Jefferson feared that in this country the government would eventually find its way to what his friend James Madison would later call a " self directed course ! ' It was with this unwelcome prospect in mind that he asked , " What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve their spirit of resistance ? " In the end , then , one does not have to agree with the Tea Party movement in every particular to welcome its appearance . </p> PAUL A.

##4088952 CONSERVATIVES , ELITES , AND POPULISM </p> ONE OF THE MANY strategic errors made by the Obama administration in the early days of 2009 was its decision to take on talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh -- though it was , perhaps , hard to blame the president and his people for trying . After all , they were riding the wave of a big electoral win and feeling pretty invincible , with large majorities in both houses of Congress and a messiah in the White House , and Limbaugh had just stunned the country , days before Obama was inaugurated , by summarizing his feelings about the new president in four simple words : " I hope he fails . " Limbaugh impatiently brushed aside the happy talk about compromise and bipartisan cooperation and scoffed at the claim that Obama was a pragmatic , post-ideological , post-partisan , post-racial conciliator and healer . Instead , he saw every reason to believe that Obama would aggressively pursue a leftist dream agenda : an exponential expansion of government 's size and power , a reordering of the American economic system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Limbaugh was not alone in such views , but he was the only major figure on the right willing to stick his neck out at a time when the rest of the nation seemed dazed into acquiescence by the so-far impeccably staged Obama ascendancy . </p> Such was the mood of the moment that it seemed a sullen breach of etiquette to utter any such criticism . In any event , the White House quickly concluded that Limbaugh 's statement was a rare blunder and that hay was to be made of it . What better way to sow division among the Republicans , and confine them to a tiny corner of American political life , than to identify Rush Limbaugh as the " real head " of their party and brand him as an unpatriotic extremist and sore loser -- or , in the light-touch description of longtime Clinton adviser Paul Begala , as " a corpulent drug addict with an AM radio talk show " ? If they could succeed in this angle of attack , they would kill two birds with one stone , marginalizing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment and internal squabbling . Each Republican would face a choice of embracing the glittering " new age " of Obama and gathering a few scraps from beneath the Democratic table or following Rush into the fever swamps of an embittered permanent minority and getting nothing at all . </p> THE DEMOCRATS ' strategy backfired . Limbaugh 's vocal opposition to the stimulus package , which he dubbed " Porkulus , " helped galvanize a unanimous Republican vote in opposition -- an astonishing achievement of partisan unity that would be repeated in subsequent lopsided votes on health care and other issues -- and would lay the blame for these failed policies entirely on the Democrats ' doorstep , culminating in a huge and decisive electoral pushback against the Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections . The question of whether Limbaugh was or is the " real leader " of the Republican Party suddenly became far less interesting to the White House and its friends in the media , perhaps because the answer was turning out to be something different from what they had expected . Limbaugh had goaded them into elevating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other putative " leaders , " they blinded themselves to the spontaneous and broad-based popular revolt that was rising against them . </p> In retrospect , the amazing part of the story is how thoroughly the White House misunderstood Limbaugh 's appeal , his staying power , and his approach to issues . It also points to a curious fact about Limbaugh 's standing in the mind of much of the American media and the American left . Even though they talk about him all the time , he 's the man who is n't quite there . By which I mean that there is a stubborn unwillingness , both wishful and self-defeating , to recognize Limbaugh for what he is , take him seriously , and grant him his legitimate due . Many of his detractors have never even listened to his show , for example . Some of his critics regularly refer to him as Rush " Lim-bough " ( like a tree limb ) , as if his name is so obscure to them that they can not even remember how to pronounce it . </p> In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clearly is . Instead , he is dismissed in one of two ways -- either as a comic buffoon , a passing phenomenon in the hit parade of American pop culture , or as a mean-spirited apostle of hate who appeals to a tiny lunatic fringe . These two views are not quite compatible , but they have one thing in common : they both aim to push him to the margins and render him illegitimate , unworthy of respectful attention . This shunning actually works in Limbaugh 's favor because it creates the very conditions that cause him to be chronically underestimated and keeps his opposition chronically off-balance . Indeed , Limbaugh 's use of comedy and irony and showmanship are integral to his modus operandi , the judo by which he draws in his opponents and then uses their own force to up-end them . And unless you make an effort to hear voices outside the echo chamber of the mainstream media , you wo n't have any inkling of what Limbaugh is all about or of how widely his reach and appeal extend . </p> The influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rush Limbaugh is unarguably one of the most important figures in the political and cultural life of the United States in the past three decades . His national radio show has been on the air steadily for nearly 23 years and continues to command a huge following , upward of 20 million listeners a week on 600 stations . The only reason it is not even bigger is that his success has spawned so many imitators , a small army of talkers such as Sean Hannity , Mark Levin , Michael Savage , Laura Ingraham , and so on , who inevitably siphon off some of his market share . He has been doing this show for three hours a day , five days a week , without guests ( except on rare occasions ) , using only the dramatic ebb and flow of his monologues , his always inventive patter with callers , his " updates , " song parodies , mimicry , and various other elements in his DJ 's bag of tricks . </p> He is equipped with a resonant and instantly recognizable baritone voice and an unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political issues and political personalities , and -- what is perhaps his greatest talent -- an astonishing ability to reformulate complex ideas in direct , vivid , and often eloquent ways , always delivering his thoughts live and unscripted , out there on the high wire . He conducts his show in an air of high-spiritedness and relaxed good humor , clearly enjoying himself , always willing to be spontaneous and unpredictable , even though he is aware that every word he utters on the air is being recorded and tracked by his political enemies in the hope that he will slip up and say something career-destroying . Limbaugh the judo master is delighted to make note of this surveillance , with the same delight he expresses when one of his " outrageous " sound bites makes the rounds of the mainstream media , and he can then play back all the sputtering but eerily uniform reactions from the mainstream commentators , turning it back on them with a well-placed witticism . </p> There are countless examples of his judo skills at work , but perhaps the most spectacular was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought to humiliate Limbaugh only to have the humiliation returned to him threefold . Limbaugh had a caller who complained that the mainstream media would not interview " real soldiers " in Iraq but instead sought out the disgruntled . Limbaugh , in agreement , cited the case of Jesse MacBeth , an Army enlistee who had failed to make it through boot camp but lied about his lack of real military service in order to speak credibly at anti-war rallies . Limbaugh called MacBeth , accurately , a " phony soldier . " But his statement was quickly pulled out of context by Media Matters , one of the Democratic groups that monitors Limbaugh 's every word , and was reframed as a swipe at all soldiers who had misgivings about the war . Limbaugh was denounced in the House for " sliming " the " brave men and women . " Reid used the occasion to address the Senate and deplore Limbaugh 's " unpatriotic comments " for going " beyond the pale of decency " and then wrote a letter to Limbaugh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Reid overplayed his hand . Far from running from the controversy , Limbaugh embraced it . He read Reid 's letter on the air , revealing it for the dishonest and bullying document it was , and then , in a stroke of pure genius , announced that he would auction it on eBay and give the proceeds to a military charitable foundation . The letter was sold for $2.1 million , and Rush matched the contribution with his own $2.1 million . Reid could only express his pleasure that the letter had done so much good . He had been flipped onto his back . </p> GIVEN Limbaugh 's talents and achievements , one would have thought that even his detractors would have an interest in knowing more about him : who he is , where he came from , and why he has acquired and kept such a large and devoted following . But in fact , there has been a remarkable lack of curiosity on that score and little incentive to go beyond the sort of routine demonization that only strengthens him . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work , by the journalist Zev Chafets , appeared in print. * As Chafets reports in the book 's acknowledgments , it was not easy finding a publisher willing to take on such a book , unless it had the words " idiot " or " liar " in the title , since , as one friend explained it to him , " I have to go out for lunch in this city every day . " So call it a politically correct lack of curiosity , then ; but whatever the reason , it has meant our missing out on a fascinating story of a very American life . </p> But not missing out entirely , since much of the story comes across in Limbaugh 's own account of himself on his show . Anyone can figure out from listening to the show that he was and is a quintessential radio guy , a product of that fluid , wide-open , insecure , enterprising , somewhat hardscrabble , somewhat gonzo world of the AM radio disc jockey , in which salesmanship and showmanship were two names for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the most predictable element of life : " packing and unpacking , town to town , up and down the dial " in the words of the theme song of WKRP in Cincinnati , the 1970s TV sitcom that captured some of the knockout zaniness of that world . Limbaugh was smitten early and permanently with the romance of radio and never really wanted to do anything else with his life , including bothering to go to college , let alone taking on his birthright , the leadership of the family law firm . </p> It was a business one could learn only in the doing . While still in high school , he started working at KMGO-AM in his hometown of Cape Girardeau , Missouri , spinning discs in the afternoons under the name " Rusty Sharpe . " Later , he was " Jeff Christie , " morning-drive DJ on WIXZ-AM in McKeesport , Pennsylvania , where he hosted " The Solid Rockin ' Gold Show . " There was a move to Kansas City , where he would eventually begin dabbling in political discussion , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps of the unpleasantly provocative Morton Downey Jr . and was able to do politically oriented talk as a solo act without guests and using his own name , finally developing the bombastic Limbaugh persona ( " El Rushbo " with " talent on loan from Gawww-duh " ) and the familiar epithets ( " Feminazis " and " Environmentalist Wackos " ) applied to his designated opponents . In Sacramento , he perfected his formula and proved a great success , tripling Downey 's already sizable audience and attracting the attention of syndicator Ed McLaughlin , who in 1988 brought him to WABC in New York to do The Rush Limbaugh Program , 21 years after those first broadcasts back at KMGO . </p> On arriving in New York , Limbaugh immediately set to work building his affiliate network and his general visibility , charging forward indefatigably on all fronts at once . He wasted no time plunging the show into the 1988 presidential campaign , branding Michael Dukakis " The Loser " and assigning him update theme music drawn from the Beatles ' " I 'm a Loser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what I appear to be , " a dig at the Massachusetts governor 's futile effort to disguise or downplay his liberalism . He began giving one-man " Rush to Excellence " tours around the country . These efforts paid off very quickly . By 1990 , the radio-show audience had hit 20 million ; his first book , The Way Things Ought to Be , was released in 1992 and sold 2 million copies in six weeks , making it at that point the fastest-selling volume in publishing history . </p> But he really hit his stride with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992 . The two men seemed to have an elective non-affinity , perhaps because they were both baby-boomer know-it-alls from the same general region of the country ( Limbaugh from southeastern Missouri , Clinton from Arkansas ) , and perhaps because Limbaugh 's unprecedented and growing influence was so intensely and visibly annoying to the ambitious young politician . Clinton , after all , had come into office borne on a wave of mainstream hosannas , and expectations were high after the 12-year Republican control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a serious obstacle to him every step of the way , proving to be a major force in rallying public opinion against Clinton 's own healthcare overhaul and helping to lay the groundwork for the anti-Clinton 1994 electoral tsunami . The newly elected Republicans even made him an honorary member of the freshman class of 1995 , an honor he coveted , even though he has always thought of himself as a conservative rather than a Republican . </p> For some time , the early Clinton years represented Limbaugh 's high point . Clinton pushed back , effectively ( if outrageously ) associating Limbaugh and talk radio with the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and winning re-election in 1996 in a walk , running against an aging and ineffective Bob Dole . That did not mean that Limbaugh let up , and the events surrounding Monica Lewinsky in 1998 gave him a rich new target , as did the electoral chaos of 2000 . But a cluster of personal issues , including charges relating to the abuse of prescription drugs and a catastrophic loss of his hearing , all seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a noticeable ebbing of energy in the show at times , and it was not immune to the fracturing effect the Bush 43 presidency had on conservatives , with internal differences emerging on issues ranging from the prescription-drug entitlement to the Iraq war to immigration reform . </p> But all that seems to have changed , and Limbaugh clearly has the wind at his back again with a newly growing audience . Like the radio guy he is and always will be , he is a survivor . He has wisely chosen to avoid television for the most part after a syndicated television show successful with audiences ( and produced by Roger Ailes in the early 1990s in a warm-up for Ailes 's unprecedented triumph as the creator of the Fox News Channel ) proved less so with advertisers . Events , too , have moved his way . The abject failure of the John McCain campaign vindicated many of Limbaugh 's longstanding complaints about the more moderate wing of the Republican Party . And the rise of Obama has proved nothing less than a godsend for him -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity it presented . </p> OCCASIONALLY , Limbaugh will talk on his show about radio , past , present , and future , and you understand that his great success is no accident . Able to draw with minuteness on more than four decades of work experience , he has achieved a comprehensive and detailed grasp of the technical , performing , and business dimensions of the industry , all of which give him an unmatched understanding of the medium and its possibilities . But it is more than a wonk 's understanding . He has a deep-in-the-bones feeling for what is magical about radio at its best -- its immediacy , its simplicity , its ability to create the richness of imagined places and moments with just a few well-placed elements of sound , its incomparable advantages as a medium for storytelling with the pride of place that it gives to the spoken word and the individual human voice , abstracted from all other considerations . He probably also understands why he himself is not nearly so good on TV , faced as he is with the classic McLuhanesque problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also understood why predictions of radio 's demise have repeatedly been proved wrong , why AM radio has lent itself particularly well to the kind of simple and easy interactivity on which talk thrives , and why the movement of talk radio into the AM band would have the same revitalizing effect there as an urban homesteader turning a decrepit old townhouse into a place of elegance and commodity . AM radio was supposed to have died off years ago due to its weak and tinny sound . But the takeover by talk in the early 1990s , primarily due to Limbaugh , managed to transform a decaying and outdated infrastructure into the perfect vehicle for the medium 's own aspirations . </p> It could not have happened without the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 . Interactive talk of one sort or another had been around since the earliest days of radio , and there had been , of course , plenty of local talk shows , mostly conservative in flavor , on many stations . But the Fairness Doctrine kept them within bounds , obliging stations holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversial issue and to provide coverage to issues of local importance . They imposed these requirements on the ground that channels were limited and so it was necessary to ensure that they served the larger public interest . </p> But with the vast and rapid growth of cable and satellite television and radio and other new media , this requirement no longer made any sense . The doctrine was abolished , and the way was opened for a show like Limbaugh 's to go into national syndication . His show could never have been sustained with the doctrine in place , a fact that has helped fuel the occasional expressions of Democratic interest -- most recently coming from Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois -- in its reinstitution . </p> It would be hard , though , to accomplish that without sparking something like an actual revolt in this country . Talk radio is , implicitly , talk-back radio -- a medium tuned into during times of frustration , exasperation , even desperation , by people who do not find that their thoughts , sentiments , values , and loyalties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media . Such feelings may be justified or unjustified , wholesome or noxious ; but in any event they are likely to fester and curdle in the absence of some outlet in which they can be expressed . Talk radio is a place where people can go to hear opinions freely expressed that they will not hear elsewhere , and where they can come away with a sense of confirmation that they are not alone , are not crazy , and are not wrong to think and feel such things . The existence of such frustrations and fears are the sine qua non of talk radio ; it would not exist without them . </p> But that is not all . Without Limbaugh's/influence , talk radio might well have become a dreary medium of loud voices , relentless anger , and seething resentment , the sort of thing that the New York screamer Joe Pyne had pioneered in the 50s and 60s -- " go gargle with razor blades , " he liked to tell his callers as he hung up on them -- and that one can still see pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have descended to the sometimes amusing but corrosive nonstop vulgarity of a Howard Stern .

In such moments , and in many other moments besides , he reminds one of the affirmative spirit of Ronald Reagan and , like Reagan , reminds his listeners of the better angels of their nature . He transmutes the anger and frustration of millions of Americans into something more constructive . </p> The critics may be correct that the flourishing of talk radio is a sign of something wrong in our culture .

##4088953 IN NOVEMBER 2010 , British retirees Paul and Rachel Chandler were released after a year of captivity at the hands of Somali pirates . " We are happy to be alive , happy to be here , desperate to see our family , and so happy to be amongst decent , everyday people , " a smiling Mrs. Chandler told journalists in Mogadishu . The Chandlers are the lucky ones . Right now , more than 600 foreign nationals remain in captivity in Somalia . Since most are crewmembers on commercial merchant vessels , the price of their freedom will most assuredly be higher than the reported $1 million exacted as ransom for the Chandlers ' release . Even more troubling is the growing body of evidence that these pirate ransoms may be funding the next generation of Islamic militants in the graveyard of the last large-scale U.S.-led intervention in Africa . </p> In 2008 , Somali pirate militias were reported to have collected up to $150 million in ransom payments . The total of ransoms paid in 2010 will surely dwarf those of previous years . Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location , opportunity , and profits . For the Somali perpetrators of hostage terrorism , piracy is a low-risk , high-reward enterprise made possible by multiple targets of low-hanging fruit : unprotected , slow-moving commercial vessels . Based primarily in the Puntland region of northeastern Somalia , pirate militias are tactically positioned to disrupt navigation in the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's most important strategic waterways . Twelve percent of the world 's oil passes through the Gulf , which links the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean . Flanked on one side by Somalia and on the other by Yemen , the Gulf is the main maritime corridor through which Middle Eastern oil reaches the West . It is also one of the busiest sea-lanes in the world . </p> Somalia 's pirate militias pose a threat not only to worldwide commerce but also to global security . As Somali pirates gain strength at sea , they strengthen their position on land . A fragile transitional government propped up by the international community is under threat from two directions . From the south , the al-Qaeda-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transitional Federal Government in the cause of global jihad . In the north , pirate militias have all but wrested control of the province of Puntland from the central government . The potential for collaboration between the cash-strapped but powerful al-Shabaab and the wealthy , strategically positioned pirate clans of the north makes Somalia a new frontline in the global war against Islamic terrorism . </p> Somalia , a simmering cauldron of anarchy for two decades , has been credibly described as hell on earth . Since 1991 , when the authoritarian regime of General Mohammed Siad Barre fell , Somalia has been gripped by internal warfare . Hundreds of thousands have been killed in the ongoing internecine conflict between clans and Islamic militants , and more than 1.5 million have been displaced from their homes . In the absence of any coastal authority to protect Somalia 's fishing rights , and faced with ecological disaster in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , fishermen in the northern province of Puntland began turning to piracy as a means of survival and retribution . Reports document Robin Hood-like accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by foreign trawlers in Somalia 's territorial waters . But what they found in the safes of commercial vessels was far more valuable than the marine catch in the hold , and so the criminal cottage industry expanded . Pirates began preying on other seafaring vessels , hijacking larger boats for use as " motherships " to go after bigger targets : internationally flagged commercial freighters and tankers hundreds of miles out at sea . </p> Somalia 's pirates are not merry bands of lucky amateurs . They are organized militias with informants in foreign ports , and networks of ransom negotiators , money launderers , and arms runners abroad . Moreover , there is mounting evidence of collaboration between militant Islamists and pirate militias . While al-Shabaab initially viewed pirate militias as dangerous territorial rivals , they have begun to enter into a tentative alliance . Pirates supply al-Shabaab with cash and smuggled weapons in exchange for training and the use of ports in al-Shabaab-controlled territory . Al-Shabaab operatives , many educated abroad in al-Qaeda training camps , are able to provide pirates with the advanced tactics needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global shipping companies . </p> Somalia 's pirates and jihadists may seem like strange bedfellows . To pirates , hostages are worth more alive than dead ; a dead hostage will not fetch a hefty ransom payment . But to organizations like al-Shabaab , hostages are frequently worth more dead than alive . The torture and execution of hostages makes for chilling physiological " psyops " against infidels and serves as a rallying cry to fellow jihadists . But with ransoms of upward of $10 million being paid out to pirates , it is only logical that a cash-starved al-Shabaab would also turn to piracy as a source of revenue for their costly insurgency . </p> As the interests of pirates and jihadists converge in Somalia , the similar challenges they pose become all the more clear . Both groups are effectively stateless and lawless . They engage in active hostilities without regard for the laws of war or the protection of civilian life and property . For these reasons , pirates have existed in a legal category unto themselves for more than 2,000 years : hostes humani generis , enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its terrorist affiliates as hostes humani generis have failed , international law as it applies to pirates remains largely unchanged . The trouble is that the modern state system lacks the resolve to apply it . Whereas the Romans used to crucify pirates and the Carthaginians used to flay them alive , the UN Security Council 's crowning achievement in its campaign against piracy is a recent report detailing the successful " business model " adopted by Somali pirates ( or , as the report termed them , " shareholders " ) . With enemies like these , who needs friends ? </p> From a legal standpoint , pirates exist in a state of war against all . Consequently , every state has a right under international law to prosecute pirates in its domestic courts . However , not every state has the political or judicial will to exercise universal jurisdiction over pirates . Since 2009 , the international community has foisted the burden of prosecuting Somali pirates on Kenya and the Seychelles , thus preferring to treat a global threat as a local nuisance . Australia , Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Union contributed funds to establish a high-security courtroom in Kenya for the purpose of bringing captured pirates to justice . The courtroom opened in June 2010 . Five months later , the High Court of Kenya at Mombasa put a quick end to the international community 's strategy of judicial outsourcing by ruling that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate acts of piracy committed beyond Kenya 's territorial waters . </p> It is not difficult to imagine why , purely as a matter of judicial policy , the Kenyan courts would disavow jurisdiction . No matter how secure a courtroom the international community wishes to build in Nairobi , it will not protect Kenya from the overflow of violence and terrorism from Somalia . More than 100,000 Somalis have sought refuge in Kenya , and al-Shabaab has sworn jihad against the Kenyan government . For Western powers to demand that a vulnerable state wage a judicial war against piracy on their behalf is , to put it politely , unreasonable . For the West to do so while its own nationals languish in captivity is , to put it bluntly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international community has ignored Somali piracy altogether . The U.S. Navy and the European Union Naval Force have been conducting active operations to deter and repress Somali piracy . Reports of their successful interruption of pirate attacks abound , from 2009 's dramatic rescue of the captain of the Maersk Alabama by Navy SEALs to the successful protection of humanitarian aid ships by the European Union 's naval contingent . But without sufficient support on land , many of their victories at sea have been Pyrrhic . When pirates are captured , they are generally handed over to local East African authorities that lack either the capacity or the will to prosecute them . Though in October 2010 , the Somali government and the African Union Commission asked the UN Security Council to impose a full blockade on the Somali coast to curtail piracy and the influx of foreign fighters and weaponry , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon responded with only a pledge to continue international engagement in Somalia with a ' light footprint . " But as conditions in Somalia deteriorate , it is hard to imagine a lighter footprint than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department 's response to piracy off the Horn of Africa has been no more decisive . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton summarized the U.S. government 's approach to the crisis as follows : " We may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st-century solutions to bear . " She was only half right . The " solutions " being brought to bear by the United States and the international community are decidedly au courant : institutional reports , diplomatic conferences , and multilateral handwringing . But the underlying problem is hardly as quaint as the secretary of state suggests . Instead of cutlasses , muskets , and cannon , these pirates are armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles , automatic weapons , and rocket-propelled grenade launchers . They are backed by regional magnates willing to front the resources necessary to fund and sustain a hostage-taking operation , providing everything from food to cell phones to qaat , a local narcotic . </p> The ambivalent legislative response by the United States government to piracy has likewise been confounding . At present , ransoms paid to pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn of Africa . It is assumed that companies will simply insulate themselves against such costs with insurance . A recent Congressional Research Report offers something that looks disturbingly like money laundering as an option for dealing with piracy . It suggests that the federal government might opt to reinsure shipping companies in the event that private insurance proves insufficient to cover the cost of ransoming mariners . So while the federal government will not pay ransoms directly , it might pay shippers to pay insurers to indemnify ransom payments to pirates . Although maritime insurance rates have so far increased tenfold in response to Somali piracy , the federal government apparently does not think this cost sufficiently high to warrant intervention . The pirates of Jefferson 's time on the shores of Tripoli should have been so fortunate . </p> Yet as ties between Somali pirates and al-Shabaab grow closer , it will become impossible for the U.S. to treat ransom payments as mere transaction costs . In April 2010 , President Obama issued an executive order banning the transfer of funds to a list of named individuals and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The named entity is al-Shabaab . </p> Piracy off the Horn of Africa is not just a maritime problem . It is a problem of lawlessness that begins on land , moves out to sea , and is felt the world over . The response of the international community in dealing with it has been wholly inadequate . In fact , in the absence of a coherent response to the problem of piracy , Somalia 's Transitional Federal Government has begun accepting donations from an as-yet-unnamed Muslim state for the establishment of a military force to combat piracy in Puntland . Punt-land , which is believed to be rich in natural gas and oil deposits , is a strategic area for more reasons than piracy alone . The mysterious nature of these donations is somewhat troubling , as it could hinder the growth of a transparent , independent government in Somalia . </p> At this point , however , the absence of any effective legitimate authority in Somalia is a greater threat to the growth of transparent , independent government in that country than anything else . Piracy and al-Shabaab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and early 2000s , and now they are fueling a new fire . Two forms of hostage-terrorism -- one for profit and one for ideology -- are finding common ground in their mutual utility . Allowing this connection to proliferate will not only shatter any hope of a free and stable Somali state ; it will also create a new sanctuary from which Muslim extremists can project jihad abroad . And all the while , the humanitarian crisis in Somalia continues to deepen . </p> The spread of piracy has been treated more as a nuisance to be endured rather than as a deadly cancer that must be extirpated for the sake of both Somalia and the rule of law . For all the lip service that has been paid in Washington and other capitals to this issue , addressing it has never been any government 's priority . That must change . The absence of decisive Western leadership has allowed the problem to fester . Somali piracy has become one of the most dangerous fronts in the struggle against the financing of international terrorism . Pirates must now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives . </p> There must be a recognition that the beginning of the solution here , as it has been with every past successful campaign to wipe out an outbreak of piracy , whether in the Caribbean or along the North African coast , is to be found in a military response . While a full-scale blockade of the entire Somali coast may not be practicable , even with a reinforced Western naval presence in the area , stepping up the scale and the frequency of patrols will begin to lower the odds that are presently stacked in favor of the pirates . </p> Equally important is the need to create a reliable judicial process that will prosecute captured pirates and impose sentences that will signal to ordinary Somalis that piracy is no longer a livelihood with great rewards and few costs . To accomplish this , an international tribunal for the adjudication of captured pirates must be established. * </p> The presence of a well-funded , ably staffed international tribunal to adjudicate acts of piracy will render the efforts of multinational naval patrols all the more effective . The streamlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall incidence of piracy and , in so doing , cut off one of al-Shabaab 's funding streams at its source . The international community will thereby begin to eliminate two of the greatest threats to the establishment of stable , legitimate , independent government in Somalia . Above all , it will break down the stranglehold that al-Shabaab has on humanitarian aid and make possible a material improvement in Somalia 's ongoing humanitarian crisis . </p> More than a decade of half-measures and hand-wringing on the part of the international community has done little to improve the lot of Somalia or ensure the freedom of the seas in its environs . If anything , conditions in the state continue to deteriorate while the world looks on . But the cost of this feckless response to piracy has been greater than the damage to one country or even the toll it has exacted on international shipping . Allowing Somalia to become the stronghold of what must increasingly be seen as a new variant on the Islamist terrorist network that is already in a state of war with the West would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link between these two forces is not soon broken , the consequences will be incalculable . Seen from the perspective of an Islamic world that is testing the will of the democratic West to prevail over terrorism , the spectacle of captured pirates being allowed to slip through the cracks of international law is proof that Islamists are poised to prevail . Just as the " broken windows " theory of urban policing illustrates the importance of not letting any crime go unpunished , so the West must see piracy as a potent threat that must be vanquished and not merely a series of human-interest stories about released hostages ; otherwise the problem will only fester . Even worse , despite the unique nature of Somalia 's problems , the West 's inability to cope with the pirates will come to be seen as a new model of success for terrorism . </p> The international community has at its disposal many of the tools needed to clear the way for Somalia 's rehabilitation ; it has only to find the resolve to use them effectively . Continued maritime patrols on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the critical first steps in this process . But until Western political leaders recognize that Somali outlaws are not merely an annoyance but a deadly peril to international law and stability that must be defeated at all costs , we must expect that the toll of blood and treasure exacted by this new breed of pirate will continue to grow . </p> * The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea , a UN organ established pursuant to the Third Law of the Sea Convention ( LOSC ) , is the most logical umbrella organization for such a tribunal , as it already has jurisdiction over acts of piracy under the LOSC . While it has yet to exercise that jurisdiction in matters relating to Somali piracy , the Hamburg-based tribunal is well equipped to do so . </p> TARA HELFMAN teaches law at Syracuse University College of Law .

##4088954 ABRAHAM LINCOLN was a Communist . But you knew that , did n't you ? Our 16th president 's bicentennial birthday , celebrated in 2009 with great fanfare , brought forth traces of an oddly far-left Lincoln , an image harking back to American Communism 's mid-20th-century heyday . </p> A special edition of PBS 's Bill Moyers Journal featured actor Sam Waterston reciting Lincoln-related literary passages . Viewers were treated to the words of Walt Whitman and Frederick Douglass , and also to lines from " Homage to Neruda , " Allen Ginsberg 's adaptation of an ode to Abraham Lincoln by the Stalinist poet and Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda . " Let the Railsplitter awake ! " cried Waterston . " Let Abraham come back , and lift the axe in his city against the new slave-makers ! " </p> Few recall this 1948 poem equating modern capitalism with slavery , which is probably all for the best , aesthetically speaking . Historically speaking , the poem is an entree into a not entirely forgotten time : the Popular Front period of the 1930s and 1940s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before -- or since , for that matter -- radical leftism and flag-waving patriotism went hand in hand in America . Though the merger was the result of an edict issued from Moscow , it was one that American Reds ( to use the terminology of the time ) enthusiastically embraced . To be sure , such thinking -- and the curious promotion of Lincoln and the American Founders that went with it -- had a limited shelf life . It waned as our World War II ally , the USSR , became our Cold War adversary . And yet , strange to say , nearly two decades after the fall of the Soviet Union , the cultural emanations of its admirers live on . </p> The Lincoln bicentennial demonstrated this . Trotted out for the 2009 celebrations was a 1942 radio opera about the martyred president 's cross-country funeral cortege . Folk singer Pete Seeger , age 89 and once one of the country 's most prominent Communist Party members , was on hand at New York 's Riverside Church to introduce students from the Aaron Copland School of Music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with music by Earl Robinson , a self-described " working-class Communist composer . " Better known was another piece from 1942 , Aaron Copland 's Lincoln Portrait . Originally composed to urge the Allies to victory over Hitler 's Germany , the Lincoln Portrait graced the bicentennial programs of half a dozen orchestras around the country . Copland , a beloved American composer , had a rather Red 1930s , having belonged then to the Workers ' Music League and the Composers ' Collective , an offshoot of the International Music Bureau of the Communist Party of the United States of America ( CPUSA ) . </p> As the historian David Herbert Donald once noted , all political groups in the United States , wherever situated on the ideological spectrum , must set about " getting right with Lincoln " or resign themselves to marginalization . Few tried harder than the CPUSA to get right with Lincoln . </p> IT IS an interesting irony that at patriotic points in our collective calendar , we often tap into the pop culture of the Popular Front period to express our national ideals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " freedom " and " equality , " idolized one of the most unfree and unfair governments in history . Younger generations may wonder -- at least the conservatives among them occasionally do -- about the vaguely left-wing inflections of this tune or that revival of a Broadway show . A look back at this episode in American culture will dispel the mystery . </p> Utopian dreams are attractive , in any age , to those who traffic in ideas . The 20th century seems to have had more than its share . From the moment the Bolsheviks triumphed in Russia in 1917 , they sought the support of European and American intellectuals . Calamity assisted their efforts . Western democracy 's failure to prevent the untold carnage of 1914-1918 and the Great Depression a decade later prompted an unusually large number of intellectuals to cast a hopeful eye toward the Soviet experiment . The socially conscious novel , play , concerto , and song came into vogue in the 1930s . The previous decade 's big works of fiction had been about flappers and others in the " smart set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about banks depriving poor sharecroppers of their land ( The Grapes of Wrath ) . </p> Many if not most " socially conscious " artists and writers , while sympathetic to Marxism , did not join the CPUSA . Its orbit widened , but it was still exotic . Communists saw a chance to break out of the political wilderness when in 1935 Moscow sought to broaden the Party 's appeal by declaring a " united front " or " popular front " against the rise of fascism . The head of the CPUSA , Earl Browder , responded with an ambitious program of implementation . His widely distributed pamphlet announcing that " Communism Is 20th Century Americanism " inspired his fellows to pitch their politics to the mainstream by identifying the workers ' revolution with American history , American ideas , and American political heroes . A coterie of liberals was receptive to an invitation couched in such affirming and familiar terms . To them , a broad coalition against the rising threat of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy seemed to make sense . </p> Browderism 's first public-relations manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Comintern in 1936 to fight against Francisco Franco 's forces , were dubbed " the Abraham Lincoln Brigade " -- or , as they called themselves , " the Lincolns . " By 1939 , Browder 's campaign was in full swing , with the CPUSA convening Lincoln-Lenin rallies and setting up adult-education centers : the Tom Paine School in Philadelphia , the Samuel Adams School in Boston , the Abraham Lincoln School in Chicago , and the Jefferson School of Social Science in New York . -That year , Howard Fast -- a winner of the Stalin Peace Prize who would later break with the CPUSA -- published Conceived in Liberty : A Novel of Valley Forge , followed a little later by Citizen Tom Paine . The conceit was that , since America and the Soviet Union were hostile to Old World aristocracy , the next step was natural : to imply a strong kinship between the American and Russian revolutions . </p> Musicians and songwriters did their part , rummaging through American history and legend for fodder . Both Valley Forge and Gettysburg were in " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Walter Lowenfels , a staffer of the official CPUSA newspaper , the Daily Worker , and Pete Seeger 's mentor , the singer Lee Hays . Aaron Copland made extensive use of folklore in his ballet Billy the Kid . Copland brought into the classical repertoire that epic contest between the hammer-wielding laborer and the mechanized drill , " John Henry . " ( His version is still popular : the conductor of a youth orchestra in Florida cheerfully introduced it to a recent audience as " a political statement about McCarthyism and the oppression of the machine . " ) The above-mentioned Earl Robinson -- whose best melody is " Joe Hill , " a perennial favorite of the labor movement , about a union organizer who was executed on a murder charge -- recorded old tunes like " Jefferson and Liberty " and composed new ones about John Brown , Horace Greeley , and Molly Pitcher , the water-carrying heroine of the War of Independence . </p> Robinson ( 1910-1991 ) was a Seattle-born composer , arranger , choral director , and performer on piano and guitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1930s and Hollywood in the 1940s . Throwing himself into what he called " our efforts to Americanize the movement , " he ended up creating two classics of the golden age of radio . His " Ballad for Americans , " a sensation when it went out over the CBS network in 1939 , gave Bing Crosby a major hit on Decca Records . It was featured at the 1940 Republican National Convention and appeared in the MGM movie Born to Sing , in a production number choreographed by Busby Berkeley . Robinson 's " The House I Live In , " recorded by , among others , Paul Robeson , Eddie Fisher , and Connie Francis , became the theme song of a famous Frank Sinatra movie short for which Sinatra and Robinson shared a special Academy Award in 1946 . Abel Meeropol , a CPUSA member who wrote under the pseudonym Lewis Allan and later adopted the two sons of convicted Communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , helped write the lyrics . </p> Part of Robinson 's Americanization crusade was to make himself -- at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln . However , to review some of the music he wrote or co-wrote is to see that " getting right with Lincoln " did n't necessarily mean getting Lincoln right . " Abraham Lincoln , " pairing Alfred Hayes 's folksy lyrics with Robinson 's incongruously modernist-sounding melody , traces Lincoln 's life in six stanzas . " A great big giant of a man was he , yes sir ! " goes this odd folk song from 1938 . Robinson recalls in his memoir scouring the CPUSA pamphlet announcing the Popular Front and discovering , to his delight , a passage that General Secretary Browder had excerpted from Lincoln 's first inaugural address : " This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it ... . Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it ! " This became the song 's refrain . ( The exclamation point was added . ) </p> No , it is n't particularly catchy when set to music . Highlighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow travelers -- of putting Lincoln on the side of mass insurrection . In fact , the president-elect had meant something else : that the right of revolution was reserved for those whose rights were being denied by their government , and the slavery defenders who seceded from the Union did not qualify . ( In that same speech , Lincoln declared : " Plainly , the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy . " ) The song " may have gone a little beyond Lincoln 's original intention , " Robinson sheepishly admitted . He recalled Orson Welles , the film director who was at the time a bigwig in theater and radio , introducing a choir performance of " Abraham Lincoln " at a CPUSA fundraiser and heralding it as a thrilling example of " militant music . " The assembled listeners " almost fainted , " said Robinson , upon hearing the 16th president portrayed as a government-toppling radical . </p> A revolution-friendly Rail Splitter was also on display in The Lonesome Train , the folk cantata that was broadcast over the radical radio station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this 25-minute radio opera -- with music by Earl Robinson and words by Millard Lampell , based on material from Carl Sandburg 's biography of Lincoln -- a spectral President Lincoln passes among humble denizens of towns and cities across the United States . It was the ubiquitous Waterston in the role of Lincoln who spoke the following line in the WBAI production : " Well I 'll tell you ma'am , it seems to me the strongest bond of human sympathy , outside your family of course , should be the one uniting all working people of all nations , tongues and kindreds . " </p> This plug for international proletarian solidarity was fashioned from Lincoln 's words . Again , it is telling to restore the words to their context in Lincoln 's 1864 " Reply to the New York Workingmen 's Democratic Republican Association . " He was talking about a tragic incident known to his correspondents : a public disturbance that saw laborers murdering other laborers . " It should never be so , " wrote Lincoln . " The strongest bond of human sympathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all working people , of all nations , and tongues , and kindreds . " </p> What you would never suspect , hearing Robinson 's cantata , is that President Lincoln evoked this agreeable image of the " strongest bond " to admonish the recipients of his letter . He went on : </p> pre-formatted table This remarkable passage -- ample demonstration that not all " men of the people " are fans of the class struggle -- held little interest for Robinson 's friend Lee Hays of the Almanac Singers , who was the one to suggest the " strongest bond " sentence be put in the cantata . According to Robinson , he and Hays and their cohorts " thrilled to the apparent Soviet success in collectivizing agriculture . " They were not in the business of acknowledging the Lincolnian view ( which is also a Washingtonian , Madisonian , and Lockean view ) that one 's labor is a form of private property and that diligent labor leading to the accumulation of property is an essential of a free society . American Communists celebrated Lincoln for ending slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anti-slavery view . </p> Such a purist was Robinson that he tried to stop his own works from being performed by politically incorrect people ( such as those odious Republicans at their convention ) or at politically incorrect times -- namely , when the CPUSA turned pacifist , suspending its anti-Fascism campaign from August 1939 until June 1941 in deference to Stalin 's non-aggression pact with Adolf Hitler . Carl Sandburg tired of Robinson 's insertion of the Party line into musical pieces on which the two men collaborated . The poet finally groused to the composer that the latter bore no resemblance to Eugene V. Debs , who was admirable for having refused to " take orders from the Moscow Vatican . " </p> In the 1950s , Robinson ran afoul of the counter-subversives . Anti-Communists protested the use of a recording of The Lonesome Train in suburban New York schools . The FBI tailed him , and he was blacklisted , which meant few would hire him for artistic projects . But if his Lincoln work got him in trouble , it also eventually came to his rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least to the extent of being the toast of Springfield . Illinois 's Republican governor Otto Kern summoned him that year to be official historian for the cultural program that the state of Illinois put on for the centenary of Lincoln 's death . Robinson got other big-historical-moment sorts of assignments every so often : he was commissioned to create a " documentary musical record " of the astronauts ' landing on the moon in 1969 . And during the United States 's bicentennial , his composing-talents were in great demand . That chapter of his memoir is entitled " 1976 : My Year . " </p> The prominence accorded Communists like Robinson during the 1940s and 50s owed much to the efforts of Pop Front liberals . Movers and shakers like the radio writer , director , and producer Norman Corwin had put Robinson and others to work at major media outlets . The fellow-traveling Corwin was a programming powerhouse at CBS , where he produced Robinson 's Ballad for Americans and The Lonesome Train . Corwin , who recently turned 100 , was a household name before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most enduring work is the oft-performed stage play The Rivalry , about Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas . That play was written in 1958 , well after his Pop Front ardor had cooled ; he broke with the Communists when they supported Kim Il-Sung 's invasion of South Korea . </p> It was during the fight against Hitler 's Germany that Corwin 's morale-boosters filled the airwaves -- from We Hold These Truths , a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Bill of Rights that aired just after Pearl Harbor , to the special program that CBS rushed onto the air on May 8 , 1945 , Victory-in-Europe Day . " Corwin 's ' little guy ' was American for ' proletariat , ' " says the narrator of I Married a Communist , the Philip Roth novel set in the Popular Front era . He was talking about the famous V-E Day program , which was called On a Note of Triumph . </p> It began : " Take a bow , GI . Take a bow , little guy . The superman of tomorrow lies at the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kids . This is the day . All the way from Newburyport to Vladivostok , you had what it took , and you gave it . And each of you has a hunk of rainbow ' round your helmet . Seems like free men have done it again ! " </p> The show was rebroadcast a week after V-E Day by popular demand . Roth would praise its script as " poeticized vernacular " and the " high demotic poetry that was the liturgy of World War II . " But not everyone liked On a Note of Triumph . Writing in Harper 's magazine at the time , the historian Bernard de Voto called it " windy , opaque , pretentious , and in the end , false . " Not debatable , in any case , is that it is a prime example of Pop Front-ese . Note the pairing of a New England port with a Russian port . And the false implication that the terrible losses inflicted on Russia by the German war machine were the sacrifices of a free people rather than a people oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian David Everitt writes in his 2007 book , A Shadow of Red , Norman Corwin 's anti-fascism , laudable in itself , spilled over into a wartime infatuation with the Soviet Union . Everitt points to the Corwin-directed program " Concerning the Red Army , " which ended in a paean to Josef Stalin . And to the Corwin series Passport for Adams , in which an American journalist visiting Russia was assured by Soviet officials that German prisoners of war were being looked after with tender care when , in fact , only a tiny percentage survived captivity . Everitt , as he quotes from that 1943 script , waxes sardonic : " ' We treat them humanely because we believe in human dignity ... and in international law , ' says this representative of the nation that invented the Gulag . " </p> Yet Corwin would emerge nearly unscathed from the postwar backlash against Communism . Red-hunters called him out for his pro-Soviet views , but he was not , according to his biographer , denied gainful employment as a result . After radio , he wrote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Southern California . Those claiming him as a role model have included Philip Roth , Ray Bradbury , Robert Altaian , Norman Lear , Larry King , and Charles Kuralt , who said , of the writers of his generation , that " we are children of Corwin . " Writing well into his 80s , he was still the go-to guy when a major event like Y2K rolled around . As 1999 drew to a close , National Public Radio broadcast his " Memos to a New Millennium , " with Walter Cronkite narrating Corwin 's 28-minute summation of the previous thousand years of human history . </p> Even more prone to turn up on somber or important occasions is the work of Aaron Copland . Although his Lincoln Portrait was yanked from the program at President Eisenhower 's inauguration for political reasons , his Fanfare for the Common Man was performed at President Reagan 's inauguration . In the sensitive time after the attacks of September 11 , Bob Dylan began his concerts by piping in recorded excerpts of Copland . </p> " One picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Abe Lincoln in the play that Norman Corwin wrote on the centennial of the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 . Many mid-20th-century American artists and writers did not pick carefully . Corwin , though , righted himself by choosing the democracies over the North Koreans in 1950 , and Copland was another who separated himself from a Popular Front that was foundering on the shoals of the Cold War . Their political profiles resolved quietly into that old-school media liberalism that is so familiar to us today . It 's a liberalism whose adherents think of patriotism as not altogether a bad thing , so long as it is in the right -- by which they mean the left -- hands . </p> The zealotry that characterized the Popular Front , the capture-the-flag fervor that ended up embedded in our popular culture , is an unrepeatable phenomenon . Michael Moores , Tony Kushners , and Oliver Stones there may be , but we are not likely ever to see creative types strap on the yoke of political-party discipline the way the Pop Fronters did . Nevertheless , the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political attitude common in the films , plays , and broadcast media of today is a descendant of the rigid leftism that once ruled the arts . The contemporary view does not entail blindly defending an evil empire as of old . It does , however , define equality as economic leveling and wisdom in international affairs as U.S. deference to others . The Red-tinged Lincoln who popped up during his bicentennial may be a weird apparition , but he tells us more about our own world than we may realize . </p> LAUREN WEINER has written on the history of American Communism for First Things , the Weekly Standard , the Baltimore Sun , and many other publications . </p> Communists saw a chance to break out of the political wilderness when in 1935 Moscow sought to broaden the Party 's appeal by declaring a " popular front " against the rise of Fascism . The CPUSA responded with an ambitious program . </p> Highlighting this passage had the virtue -- for Communists and their fellow travelers -- of putting Abraham Lincoln on the side of mass insurrection . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists were not in the business of acknowledging the Lincolnian view that one 's labor is a form of private property and that diligent labor leading to the accumulation of property is an essential of a free society . </p> Norman Corwin would emerge nearly unscathed from the postwar backlash against Communism . Red-hunters called him out for his pro-Soviet views , but he was not denied gainful employment as a result . </p> The effects of this long-past historical moment are still felt . The political attitude common in the films , plays , and broadcast media of today is a descendant of the rigid leftism that once ruled the arts . </p> By Lauren Weiner </p> 
##4119575 News Focus </p> Writer David C. Holzman first heard about ecosystem services in current presidential science advisor John P. Holdren 's class " Quantitative Aspects of Global Environmental Problems " at the University of California , Berkeley , in winter quarter , 1975 . The late Lee Schipper , Holzman 's original mentor on energy issues , had recommended the class </p> Healthy ecosystems provide us with fertile soil , clean water , timber , and food . They reduce the spread of diseases . They protect against flooding . Worldwide , they regulate atmospheric concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide . They moderate climate . Without these and other " ecosystem services , " we 'd all perish. 1 </p> One hallmark of the history of civilization is an ever-increasing exploitation of ecosystem services coupled with substitution of technology for these services , particularly where ecosystems have been exploited beyond their ability to provide. 2 Agriculture is a hybrid of exploitation and substitution that enabled people to live in greater , denser populations that drove further exploitation and substitution . Modern plumbing made close quarters far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down sewage , and to substitution with expensive sewage treatment technologies . Exploitation of fossil fuels led to a slew of modern conveniences , including fishing fleets that are so effective at catching their prey that they threaten fisheries globally 3 , 4 All this exploitation strained ecosystems , but in the past , when the population was a fraction of what it is now , these strains were local rather than global phenomena . </p> In 2005 the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA ) , 5 a sweeping survey conducted under the auspices of the United Nations , found that approximately 60% of 24 ecosystem services examined were being degraded or used unsustainably. 6 " Every year we lose three to five trillion dollars ' worth of natural capital , roughly equivalent to the amount of money we lost in the financial crisis of 2008-2009 , " says Dolf de Groot , leader of the Research Program on Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and Management at Wageningen University , the Netherlands . </p> The value of ecosystem services typically goes unaccounted for in business and policy decisions and in market prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , they are perceived as free goods , like clean air and water . So it 's not surprising that much of the degradation of ecosystems is rooted in what the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ) , an independent group of U.S. scientists and engineers , describes as " widespread underappreciation of the importance of environmental capital for human wellbeing and the absence of the value of its services from the economic balance sheets of producers and consumers . " 7 PCAST and other groups are working to build recognition of ecosystem services and , importantly , to valuate them -- that is , calculate values for these services to help policy makers and resource managers make rational decisions that factor important environmental and human health outcomes into the bottom line . </p> An Idea Whose Time Has Come ? In July 2011 PCAST called upon the federal government to assess quadrennially the condition of the nation 's ecosystems and the social and economic value of services they provide . The goal was to improve methods for evaluating those services and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather new information in a format that interested parties can easily use. 7 </p> But the concept of valuating ecosystem services is not new . John P. Holdren , now science advisor to President Barack Obama , introduced it to students in his class " Quantitative Aspects of Global Environmental Problems " at the University of California , Berkeley , in the 1970s . He emphasized that technological substitutions for ecosystem services are often costly , sometimes to the point of impracticality , and that sometimes an incomeplete understanding of how they function makes such substitutions impossible . Geoengineering to mitigate global climate disruption in the face of increasing emissions , for example , is widely viewed as extremely risky , because the climate is so complex . </p> In 1997 Robert Costanza , Distinguished University Professor of sustainability at Portland State University , Oregon , and colleagues first estimated that ecosystem services worldwide are worth an average $33 trillion annually ( $44 trillion in today 's dollars ) , nearly twice the global GNP of around $18 trillion ( $24 trillion in today 's dollars ) . 8 Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was widely praised for drawing attention to the value of ecosystem services , says Rick Linthurst , national program director of the Ecosystem Services Research Program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . </p> Payments to preserve ecosystem services date to at least the early 1980s , when the United States implemented wetland and stream credit banking , 9 but the idea really took off in the mid 1990s . For instance , in 1996 Costa Rica began paying landowners $42 per hectare per year to preserve forest. 10 At the time , that country had the highest deforestation rate in the world ; now it has among the lowest , says Gretchen C. Daily , Bing Professor of Environmental Science at Stanford University . </p> China responded to a devastating drought in 1997 , followed by massive floods in 1998 , by inaugurating various payments for ecosystem services and a policy for conserving areas that are important sources of ecosystem services . These are known as Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas . Among the benefits : soil erosion fell sufficiently to cut sediment in the Yellow River by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequestration rose by an estimated 1.3 billion tons between 1998 and 2010 , says Jianguo Liu , the Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability and University Distinguished Professor of fisheries and wildlife at Michigan State University . But he adds that some benefits probably came at the expense of natural capital elsewhere in the world , as declines in forest cutting coincided with a rise in imported timber . </p> In 2010 the World Bank launched a program to help countries incorporate the value of ecosystem services into their accounting systems with an eye toward managing ecosystems to maximize economic benefit. 11 Colombia , beset for several years by unusually persistent and damaging rains , is one of five pilot countries working with the bank . </p> Elsewhere , Norway is paying Indonesia $1 billion to preserve rainforest for carbon storage and sequestration to limit the impacts of climate change. 12 And in Vietnam , an investment of $1.1 million in mangroves , which protect coastal regions from flooding , saved $7.3 million annually that would have gone to maintaining dikes. 1 </p> A number of agencies of the U.S. federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembling a national atlas that can overlay visual information , like that used in Google Earth , with ecological and economic analyses to reveal variability in ecosystem service provision . The agency also has pilot programs in four regions of the United States enabling interested parties to project different resource-use scenarios into the future to help guide decision making now. 13 </p> And in 2007 environment ministers from the G8+5 countries 14 agreed to begin analyzing the global economic benefits that derive from ecosystems and biodiversity , and to compare the costs of failure to protect these resources with the costs of conserving them . In the ensuing years , the resulting initiative , The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) , 15 has produced a series of reports for decision makers at the international , national and local levels aimed at enabling practical responses . </p> Another leader in guiding decision makers on payments for ecosystem services is the Natural Capital ( NatCap ) Project , cofounded by Stanford 's Daily in 2006. 16 NatCap has created software called InVEST ( Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social benefits , so that decision makers can explore the implications of alternative land-use scenarios . For any given piece of real estate , InVEST can take existing data on various ecosystem services -- each of which may fall under a different field of study -- and provide one consistent platform for assessing all of them together , to determine the optimal use(s) of that land , says Heather Tallis , lead scientist of NatCap . For example , " trade-off curves " can reveal how much timber can be harvested before causing major profit loss to hydropower , flood damage , or loss of biodiversity . The tools are available free through NatCap. 17 </p> NatCap 's consulting group is currently working on numerous projects within the United States and with 15 other countries in Africa , Latin America , the Pacific , North America , and Asia . Foremost among those countries is China , which is spending a total of around $100 billion -- more than any other country -- to preserve forestlands through logging bans , to buy farms that are perched unsustainably on steep slopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese government will shift farmers either to more sustainable locations or to other occupations , says Daily . NatCap is using InVEST to assess how many resource-intensive livelihoods -- in farming , forestry , herding , and other fields -- could be supported sustainably in a certain area under given practices , and to evaluate how shifting inhabitants to an alternative mix of livelihoods would impact natural capital and ecosystem services . This helps inform the investments needed to enable desired shifts , as well as to ascertain who will benefit and who will be hurt by the shifts , and to determine appropriate compensation , says Daily . </p> Assigning a Dollar Value Ecosystem services are valued , ideally , by how much human welfare they can provide . The most convenient measure of welfare is dollars , although at this early stage of development of the science , that is not always a practical measure . </p> Values for provisioning services see sidebar , " What Are Ecosystem Services ? " are relatively easy to determine . The simplest and least controversial methods to assess value draw on existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NatCap Project at the World Wildlife Fund U.S. office . For example , coastal and marine ecosystems support the production of fish . The value of this service can be assessed based on revenues , a function of the price and quantity of harvested fish . </p> Thus , the value of the provisioning service is equal to how much all of its current and future production is worth today -- what economists call its " present value . " The further into the future the production lies , the lower the present value of the service . That 's because money invested today in a safe investment , such as a Treasury bill , almost certainly will grow . If Treasury bills are earning 3% , $100 invested today will become $103 a year from now , $106.09 two years from now , and so on . That means that $106.09 two years from now is no more valuable than $100 today . </p> Many ecosystem services , such as scenery , recreational value , and most regulatory services , including those moderating infectious disease , lack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking people what they would pay for a particular service , says Stephen Polasky Fesler-Lampert Professor of ecological/environmental economics at the University of Minnesota ; this is called " stated preference . " Another method , " revealed preference , " involves determining values from related actual purchases , such as the money people spend to travel to bucolic tourist destinations , or the extra cost of a house with a water view over a similar nearby house without the view . </p> Another valuation technique is estimating " replacement cost . " This is the cost of the least expensive technical fix as a replacement for an ecosystem service . For example , New York City recently paid landowners in its watershed more than $1 billion to change their farm management practices to prevent animal waste and fertilizer from washing into the waterways . In doing so , the city avoided spending $6-8 billion on a new water filtration plant and $300-500 million annually to run it -- the replacement cost of the natural filtration provided by waterways. 1 " Protecting the watershed along with the ecosystem service it provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight billion dollars because that is the cost of replacing the service , " says Polasky who notes that the value of clean water is far higher still . </p> The value of an ecosystem service depends on local and/or regional socioeconomic conditions as well as supply and demand . Thus , the value of clean water is much higher in New York City 's watershed , where it serves 19 million people7 than it would be in , say , Alaska , says Polasky . </p> When it comes to valuating ecosystem services , the economics is the easy part -- easy being a relative term . The major difficulties have more to do with the fact that ecology is a relatively young science , and there is much that we do n't yet understand about it , says Polasky , echoing colleagues . " Nature is probably the most complex system we know of , " Daily explains . </p> Huge Error Bars and Heroic Assumptions Part of the problem , generally speaking , is that the multiple uncertainties about how ecosystems do what they do add up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often based on " heroic assumptions " that do n't stand on much data , says Lisa Wainger , a research associate professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science . </p> For instance , scientific understanding of feedback among the many ecosystem services remains wanting -- " If you have more carbon in soil , are plants better able to take up nitrogen ? " asks Polasky , as one example . A good deal of ecological uncertainty stems from a lack of information about basic natural history . The PCAST report notes that " groups of organisms likely to be most important in ecological terms , such as species that determine soil fertility , promote nutrient cycling , or consume wastes are among the least familiar and least visible -- e.g. , fungi , nematodes , mites , insects , and bacteria . Populations of ecologically dominant marine organisms , most of which are either invertebrates or microbes , are just as poorly understood . " 7 </p> Climate change magnifies all these ecological uncertainties . It 's " the mother of all externalities , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Sussex , " larger , more complex , and more uncertain than any other environmental problem . " 19 Over the rest of the century , global climate shifts are likely to be the biggest driver of ecosystem change and may greatly reduce Earth 's carrying capacity , according to PCAST. 7 </p> It also remains difficult to link changes in the delivery of ecosystem services to changes in human welfare . " There are many mysteries about which species confer what dynamics to ecosystems or what benefits to people , " says Daily . " We really do n't know how much biodiversity is needed to sustain and fulfill human life . " </p> But more precise knowledge of the economic value of those ecosystem services that can easily be valuated " would not , in itself provide insight into what fraction of the benefit would be lost in consequence of a given type or degree of ecosystem disruption , " according to the PCAST report. 7 There are thresholds in ecosystem function beyond which carrying capacity plummets . History and prehistory are littered with thresholds breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desertified Middle East ( probably due to mismanagement of irrigation , says Daily ) to the deforestation , extinction of all wild land birds , and human population collapse on Easter Island. 2 One of the biggest fears about the impact of climate change is that global thresholds will be breached , but the ability to predict such with anything approaching precision is currently beyond ecological science . </p> Progress Despite the challenges , considerable progress has been made over the last decade toward improved techniques for linking changes in ecosystem services to changes in human welfare . Part of that improvement is due to modeling methods , including InVEST , as well as to greater numbers of ecological studies , and part is due to improvements in the data , says Polasky . The field has been boosted by the revolution in GIS ( geographic information system ) technology and so-called spatially explicit data : " We now have very good images that enable us to know the heights of plants and elevations of terrain , and really good sensors that show us what 's on the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring . If we increase the deforestation upriver , we can monitor the sediment downriver . That 's been a huge help . " </p> Health &; Ecosystems : Analysis of Linkages ( HEAL ) , 20 a consortium of more than 25 conservation and public health institutions , has embarked on the first rigorous , systematic attempt to measure the human health impacts of changes in a variety of natural systems . HEAL 's projects are designed to evaluate what are thought to be key connections between the environment and health . Examples include the relationships between subsistence hunters ' sustainable access to wildlife and their children 's nutritional needs ( particularly as related to iron and key micronutrient deficiencies ) ; between upland deforestation on islands such as Fiji , erosion and waterborne diarrheal diseases in children , and downstream coral reef health and productivity ; between deforestation patterns and malaria in the Amazon and other major forest systems ; between landscape fires in Sumatra and smoke-related cardiopulmonary illness in the broader region downwind ; and between fishers ' access to Marine Protected Areas , food security , income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a " sense of place " related to coastal resource security . </p> Perhaps most importantly , says Steve Osofsky , HEAL coordinator and director of health policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society , the project seeks to quantify all these types of relationships related to communicable diseases , noncommunicable diseases , nutrition , and the social and psychological dimensions of health . In Osofsky 's words , " If it can not be measured , it can not be managed . " </p> The ultimate goal of valuating ecosystem services " is to improve human well-being overall , " says Daily . She cautions that there will always be people who lose out in any policy decision . However , she says , " The aim is to design these investments in natural capital so as to advance human development and alleviate poverty at the same time . This is the Holy Grail .

##4119576 News Innovations </p> Exposures that cause chronic diseases usually take place years , perhaps decades , before disease is diagnosed . Biomarkers collected at single points of time therefore can not tell the whole story of how disease occurs in an individual . For that , one must look to the " exposome , " or the compilation of exposures experienced over an individual 's lifetime . But efforts to link environmental exposures to disease have been stymied by the difficulty of accurately measuring those day-to-day exposures and the substances that are present in people 's bodies . </p> The term " exposome " was initially coined in 2005 by Christopher Wild , 1 who now directs the International Agency for Research on Cancer , in recognition of the failure of genetic factors to explain most variability in human diseases . The exposome concept reflects the reality that people are exposed to potentially health-impairing agents from both pollution and nonpollution sources , including industrial chemicals , combustion emissions , radiation , heat/cold , noise , and food . The exposome also includes behavioral factors , such as activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expo-some includes his or her microbiome , 2 or vast personalized assembly of commensal microbes . All these exposures and factors can vary over the course of a day , not to mention over the weeks , months , and years that make up a lifetime . </p> In the last few years , tools and methodologies have begun to emerge that hold promise for more easily capturing information about at least some of the environmental exposures that an individual may come into contact with over the course of his or her lifetime . The new tools come from a wide range of disciplines -- some of which fall outside the usual domain of environmental health -- and they are already helping researchers amass data on real-world exposures . These tools also hold promise for conducting studies that uncover unexpected links between environmental exposures and disease . </p> Several of the most promising tools and approaches were discussed at a workshop of the National Academies ' Emerging Science for Environmental Health Decisions committee in December 20ll. 3 Some of these tools are already helping researchers get a handle on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease and cancer , says Steve Rappaport , director of the Center for Exposure Biology at the University of California ( UC ) , Berkeley , who organized the workshop . </p> Measuring External Exposures Tools for measuring the exposome are aimed at assessing exposures that take place both outside the body ( the " exposure dose " ) and inside ( the " absorbed dose " ) ; both are important for determining whether an environmental agent causes actual harm , says Linda Birnbaum , director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) . For example , as some studies have shown , such as research involving measurements of arsenic in soil , house dust , and urine , " a big increase in external exposure may not necessarily result in a major increase in internal exposure . At the same time , if you ca n't tell where an internally measured chemical came from , it 's impossible to prevent the exposure . </p> Some of the new tools for measuring external exposures capitalize on the fact that the majority of the world 's citizenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 Cell phones already contain components that make them suitable for collecting key information associated with environmental exposures , points out Michael Jerrett , an associate professor in the Environmental Health Sciences program at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health . These instruments include ambient light meters , Global Positioning System sensors , and accelerometers , which measure movement . The latter two instruments can indicate when people travel by motor vehicle , which can be a major source of exposure to air pollutants , he says . </p> In an unpublished pilot study in Barcelona , Jerrett has been testing cell phones ' suitability for tracking environmental exposures . Students ' movements , as tracked by cell phones and other wearable devices , are overlaid on models developed by the city 's Energy Agency and others to predict air pollution levels . Jerrett says measurements collected via cell phones compare quite favorably with those taken by equipment that has traditionally been used to measure personal exposures , which was often the size of a backpack . </p> Another way that cell phones can help researchers is by interfacing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Bluetooth-enabled SensPod monitor , which collects data on ozone , carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide , nitrogen oxides , noise , and ultraviolet radiation . In Copenhagen , Jerrett says , a network of individual cyclists travel through the city with SensPods mounted on their bikes . The monitors inform the cyclists about their personal exposures as they move through the city , and the data can be uploaded to an application that compiles them into a pollution map . Users can pair their SensPods with an Android smart-phone via a mobile application that lets the two devices communicate and share data with the larger network of SensPod users . People in more than 20 countries in Europe , Asia , and North America are using the mobile sensors , according to Sensaris , the company that makes the devices. 6 It 's no stretch to imagine investigators using these devices for research purposes . </p> Among the investigators working to expand the array of chemicals that can be detected by handheld sensors is Non-gjian ( NJ ) Tao , director of the Center for Biosensor and Bioelectronics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wireless , wearable device the size of a cell phone that is capable of sensing petroleum-derived hydrocarbons , such as benzene , toluene , ethylene , and xylene ( all of which are known or suspected human carcinogens 7 ) . Field-testing at an Arizona State waste management facility showed that the sensor could detect acid vapors associated with waste management , including phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid . Tao says his devices have proven sufficiently sensitive to detect benzene , toluene , ethylene , and xylene at concentrations of 1 ppb , comparable to commercially available detectors . </p> The tests Tao has conducted to date may be useful for evaluating personal exposures because they can generate results similar to those shown by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring systems . At the same time , the handheld devices can identify peaks the stationary monitors might miss . Tao is gearing up to begin pilot-testing the monitors in epidemiologic studies . </p> Another important aspect of personal exposure revolves around individuals ' levels of exertion . Stephen Intille , an associate professor in the College of Computer and Information Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led the development of the Wockets system , a wearable device capable of recording people 's physical activity . Such data are important to exposure assessment because physical exertion can change the dose of pollution a person receives . In one study , people driving a car or riding in a bus inhaled about 4.5 L air per minute , whereas subway riders inhaled 10 L/min , people walking inhaled 23 L/min , and cyclists inhaled 37 L/min. 8 </p> Intille 's Wockets are different from consumer-targeted wearable activity monitors , such as heart-rate monitors and pedometers , in that they provide continual data on the type , intensity , duration , and location of the wearer 's upper- and lower-body physical activity for months at a time . They also collect data on compliance so that researchers know whether the monitors are being used . The Wockets were initially designed with input from a group of self-described " non-technophile " volunteers aged 22 to 82 to ensure they are easy enough for even the least tech-savvy study participant to use . Intille 's team has also created " reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt participants to comply with research protocols . He hopes to have collected enough data to verify that the Wockets work as promised by the end of 2012 . </p> Because the data from personal sensors such as the ones Sensaris produces can be posted online in near real time , it sets the stage for what Jerrett calls " participatory sensing networks " fed by inputs from wired citizens . ( Although the Wockets data also are available very quickly , access to these data will be strictly controlled by the researchers , Intille stresses . ) Whether the data come from individuals or centralized monitoring stations , they have great educational potential , Intille says -- people participating in the network could learn about potential exposures associated with any given point in space and time , and having detailed data on exposures may also enable researchers to design interventions to reduce exposures , which could be programmed into smart devices . </p> " It 's one thing to know where people are exposed or how much people are exposed to , but once you know that as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them change their exposure levels , " Intille says . For example , smart technology might reveal when small changes in behavior ( such as staying farther away from the cars ahead of you in traffic or walking a slightly different route ) could effect significant changes in exposure to pollutants that exacerbate asthma , he points out . However , Intille and Jerrett agree that important privacy issues need to be worked out before these concepts can be fully realized . </p> Internal Exposure Data A major advantage of focusing on the internal exposome is that you do n't necessarily need to know exactly what you 're looking for in order to find something important to human health , Rappaport says . " By comparing complex patterns of chemical signals detected in the blood of healthy and diseased persons , it is possible to pinpoint particular chemicals whose levels are higher or lower in the people with disease , " he explains . This , he says , holds promise for helping scientists ferret out and characterize the heretofore unknown risk factors that underlie a large portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expo-some data include efforts using blood plasma , urine , feces , and cells from inside one 's cheek or nostril . Some of these technologies already exist for other purposes . For example , Rajeshwari Sundaram , an investigator at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , points out that over-the-counter fertility monitors used by couples seeking to become pregnant can be useful for collecting hormonal data from women of child-bearing age . Sundaram is involved in the National Institutes of Health 's Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment ( LIFE ) study , which is using the monitors to capture daily changes in levels of reproductive hormones in a group of women who are trying to become pregnant . The LIFE study , which also involves men , is investigating how exposure to a variety of endocrine-disrupting compounds affects hormonally driven issues such as semen quality , time to pregnancy , infertility , pregnancy loss , gestation duration , and birth size. 9 </p> Another project under way to collect internal exposome data is headed up by Avrum Spira , a pulmonologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human airway as signatures of internal exposure to smoke from tobacco and cooking fires . The group is currently focused on studying airway expression of the small noncoding RNA sequences known as microRNAs , or miRNAs , which regulate the genetic response to smoking. 10 Spira 's group 's work is based on the hypothesis that cigarette smoke and other inhaled exposures alter epithelial cell gene expression throughout the respiratory tract11 and that variability in this gene-expression response is associated with risk for developing lung disease. 12 One of the group 's ongoing projects is to identify novel miRNAs in the airway that may ultimately serve as biomarkers for detecting lung cancer based on a sample that can be easily captured through the nose or mouth . The team is also investigating whether exposure to burning biomass , such as through cooking fires , alters gene expression in these cells . </p> One of the most unexpected findings to result from an internal exposome investigation was published last year , when a group led by Stanley Hazen , head of the Cleveland Clinic 's Preventive Cardiology and Rehabilitation section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease risk played by consumption of choline and other nutrients in concert with the micro-biome. 13 According to Hazen , the microbiome is particularly important because it is a filter of what he calls our largest environmental exposure -- what we eat -- and is a major contributor to our internal exposure . </p> Hazen is the principal investigator in a clinical study that is following more than 10,000 patients in a bid to identify small molecules in blood plasma and related pathways that predict an increased risk for major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks . By studying samples from 150 randomly selected people who experienced a heart attack or stroke in the three years following enrollment , together with age- and sex-matched control subjects , Hazen 's group detected a host of candidate compounds associated with cardiovascular risk . </p> The investigation revealed that when animals and people consume diets rich in choline ( a compound abundant in meat , poultry , and eggs ) , their gut microbes can transform the choline to trimethylamine . Trimethyl-amine is rapidly metabolized in the liver to trimethylamine iV-oxide ( TMAO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerated thickening of the artery walls due to accumulation of cholesterol , compared with mice with lower TMAO levels . Hazen 's group further demonstrated that a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics could suppress intestinal flora in mice and prevent production of atherogenic TMAO from the choline in ingested egg yolk lecithin. 13 </p> Hazen also reported that in a group of nearly 2,000 cardiovascular disease patients and controls , plasma TMAO levels predicted the future risk of cardiac events independent of traditional risk factors . 13 This suggests that a person 's microbiome profile could affect his or her heart-attack risk as much as or more than diet . It also could help explain why some people can get away with eating cholesterol-rich diets and others ca n't -- maybe those with gut flora that are poor at making TMAO are at less risk from eating high-fat diets , Hazen says . Although choline is an essential micro-nutrient crucial for brain development , many people may be getting too much of it , adds Hazen , in part because of the widespread use of lecithin in commercial baked goods to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 other examples where researchers have used an untargeted " omics " screening approach -- such as that used by Hazen 's group -- to identify potential markers of disease , Rappaport says . " By accumulating the biologically active chemicals from these studies in a library of potential environmental hazards , future investigators will be able to determine whether these chemicals are involved in a host of diseases whose origins are currently unknown , " he says . </p> Managing the Data To truly characterize the exposome , however , these internal and external measurement modalities must be integrated . Although external exposures do n't lend themselves to the untargeted omics approach that has led to recent advances involving the internal exposome , Rappaport stresses that air and water pollution and other external factors , such as exercise and stress , contribute to human diseases and must be controlled . " This will require more and better methods for simultaneously monitoring multiple targeted external stressors and , in time , for combining external measurements with internal exposomes , " he says . </p> The ability to compare samples taken before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious advantage to studying the exposome . Rappaport says investigators can move the science forward by developing prospective cohort studies that collect data on external stressors while also obtaining and storing blood or other biospecimens for future measurements of internal exposomes . </p> Accordingly , Nathaniel Rothman , head of molecular studies at the National Cancer Institute , says the 40 -- 50 general prospective cohort studies currently under way throughout the world have a variety of biological samples and history information available that scientists may be able to use in future exposome studies . Studies where repeat samples have been taken may prove especially useful , he notes . Birnbaum adds that the NIEHS maintains a huge library of biological specimens from studies conducted by intramural investigators . Suzanne Fitz-patrick , senior science advisor in the Office of the Chief Scientist at the Food and Drug Administration , points out that the samples collected during drug trials may be available for use by other researchers , too . Paul Elliott , chairman of epidemiology and public health medicine at Imperial College London School of Public Health , says the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drug testing in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games to invest in what he called " exposomic " research . </p> Chirag Patel , a postdoctoral research fellow at the Stanford University School of Medicine , thinks the comprehensive connection of environmental factors to disease is now possible using the high-throughput analysis methods common in genome-based investigations . His proof of concept for such so-called environment-wide association studies used blood serum and urine samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) cohorts from 1999 through 2006 . In 2010 his group reported unexpected associations between type 2 diabetes and environmental exposures to heptachlor epoxide and ? -tocopherol. 14 They also found associations with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) -- which have previously been linked to this form of diabetes -- and with pesticides . Investigators elsewhere have hypothesized that these chemicals might increase risk of obesity and metabolic diseases . </p> More recently , Patel 's group used the same techniques with NHANES data to screen for associations between environmental chemicals and blood lipids. 15 The preliminary findings suggest that higher levels of triglycerides and lower levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with higher concentrations of fat-soluble contaminants such as PCBs and dibenzofurans . Patel says these associations merit more investigation , although he also makes it clear that the potential for confounding and reverse causal biases needs to be investigated via longitudinal and followup studies . That is , because the studies are cross-sectional in nature , it is entirely possible that the associations are a consequence of disease rather than a cause . </p> In the longer-term future , Patel envisions a time when improvements in our ability to measure both the internal and external exposomes will enable investigators to assess hundreds to thousands of different factors in connection to specific diseases or health states . To use that information to discover associations with disease , he foresees that new analytical and informatics methods will be required . This was an issue in early genomics studies , and it eventually led to a proliferation of new statistical techniques and the field of bioinformatics , he points out . </p> Birnbaum , for one , is cautiously optimistic about the promise of environment-wide association studies . " Genetic factors are inherently less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may need some additional tools to deal with the environment . While bioinformatics is doing a great job now with the genetic information , I think we have a long way to go , and we need a lot more bioinformatics approaches and understanding to deal with the wealth of information that will come from the exposome . " </p> A person 's exposome is the sum total of the many exposure factors that fill the days , months , and decades of that person 's lifetime -- the exposures to chemicals , radiation , heat/cold , i noise , food , stress , and other environmental agents ; the health behaviors and activities ; and the unique profile of commensal bacteria that make an individual an individual . </p> Physical exertion is an important consideration when measuring exposure , because activity levels can affect how much of a pollutant a person inhales . In one study of different travel modalities , people riding bicycles inhaled more than 8 times as much air per minute as people driving cars and half again as much air as people who walked. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise less -- rather , smart technology may someday advise travelers on small behavioral tweaks ( such as falling behind the traffic ahead or taking a slightly different route ) that could significantly reduce exposure to pollutants . </p> The microbiome is particularly important because it is a filter of perhaps our largest environmental exposure -- our diet . Moreover , different intestinal bacteria can convert contaminants into new forms that may be more or less bioavailable than the original compound . Variations in individuals ' microbiomes could help explain why different people have different levels of susceptibility to environmentally influenced diseases . </p> REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . Wild C.

##4119660 Objectives . We better defined the distribution and determinants of coal workers ' pneumoconiosis ( CWP ) among US underground coal miners . </p> Methods . We obtained chest radiographs from the mobile unit of an enhanced surveillance program begun in 2005 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for underground coal miners . B Readers classified them for presence of pneumoconiosis . </p> Results . Miners from 15 states participated ( n = 6658 ) . The prevalence of CWP was higher in 3 states ( Kentucky , 9.0% ; Virginia , 8.0% ; West Virginia , 4.8% ) than in 12 other states ( age-adjusted risk ratio RR = 4.5 ; 95% confidence interval CI = 3.3 , 6.1 ) . Miners in these 3 states were younger and had less mining tenure , but advanced CWP ( category ? 2/1 ; RR = 8.1 ; 95% CI = 3.9 , 16.9 ) and progressive massive fibrosis ( RR = 10.5 ; 95% CI = 3.8 , 29.1 ) was more prevalent among them . Advanced CWP and progressive massive fibrosis were more prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrespective of mining region , than among workers at larger mines . </p> Conclusions . Enhanced surveillance results confirmed the persistence of severe CWP among US coal miners and documented the health consequences of inadequate dust control for miners in parts of Appalachia and at smaller mines . ( Am J Public Health . 2012 ; 102:S279-S283 . ) </p> In the early 2000s , during the routine analysis of surveillance chest radiographs of underground coal miners , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) began observing several aberrations in the frequency and severity of radiographic abnormalities among underground coal miners in the United States . Specifically , the overall prevalence of coal workers ' pneumoconiosis ( CWP ) appeared to be increasing , and NIOSH identified geographical clustering of CWP and observed rapid progression and increased disease severity , including progression to the most severe and fatal stage , progressive massive fibrosis ( PMF ) . 1 2 </p> In response to these occupational health findings , NIOSH , with support from the US Department of Labor 's Mine Safety and Health Administration , established and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECWHSP ) . ECWHSP , using a mobile examination unit in areas in which rapidly progressing CWP had been identified , 1-4 further assessed the initial surveillance findings , better defined the scope and magnitude of the problem and identified potentially remediable causes of the continuing development and progression of lung disease among underground coal miners . </p> Our focus was ECWHSP 's radiographic findings consistent with CWP among miner participants . Specifically , we examined the radiographic patterns among this group of at-risk miners and investigated potential explanatory factors such as mine location and size . </p> METHODS Characteristics of the ECWHSP have previously been described , 5 and information about the program , including methods and survey sites , is publicly available. 6 In brief , chest radiographs were taken in a mobile examination unit at or near mine sites and according to NIOSH-specified procedures , and they were classified by B Readers 7 for the presence , profusion , and type of lung parenchymal abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis using the 2000 revision of the International Labour Office 's International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses. 8 The mobile examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiographs. 9 We restricted the analysis to the most recent radiograph available for each individual . All participants provided informed consent . </p> We defined the presence of CWP as a profusion of small pneumoconiotic opacities classified as 1/0 or greater or as PMF , according to the International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses. 8 We defined the presence of PMF as the recording of any large opacity interpreted as being consistent with massive fibrosis ( i.e. , Stage A , B , or C ) . On the basis of previous work , we included as a severity indicator r-type opacities , which have previously been used as a surrogate for silica exposure. 10 A radiograph was determined to show r-type opacities ( rounded opacities between 3 and 10 mm in diameter ) when the B Reader indicated r-type opacity as either primary or secondary . Multiple readings were available for each radiograph . To determine simple CWP profusion and presence of PMF , we used the NIOSH final determination , a summary measure derived from multiple classifications using a standardized procedure. 2 To evaluate small opacity size and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Data were available for September 2005 through October 2009 . Complete information on small opacity profusion , mine location , and employment size ( mine size ) was required for inclusion in the study . </p> We obtained mine name and location from each participating miner and determined the number of miners at the mine from reports submitted by mine operators to the Mine Safety and Health Administration . To calculate risk ratios , we categorized mine size by quartiles using the data for miners with CWP . In addition , we aggregated the data for the 3 states with highest CWP prevalence ( Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia ) and compared them with data for all other regions . This aggregation provided an approximately equal number of observations for both groupings . Because miner age is known to be associated with the presence and severity of CWP , we adjusted all disease risk ratios for miner age using log binomial regression . We compared median miner age using the Wilcoxon rank sum test . We used SAS version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants from 416 mines located in 15 states . The number of radiographs collected from miners in each state is presented in Figure 1 . The unadjusted prevalence of CWP varied by region and was highest in Kentucky ( 9.0% ) and Virginia ( 8% ) but did not differ between them ( P = .51 ) . CWP was found in 4.8% of the radiographs of miners from West Virginia , which significantly differed from its prevalence in Kentucky and Virginia ( risk ratio RR = 1.8 ; 95% CI = 1.4 , 2.3 ; P&lt; .001 ) . The prevalence of CWP in Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia as a group was 4 times as high as its prevalence in the other 12 states ( age-adjusted RR = 4.5 ; 95% CI = 3.3 , 6.1 ) , although miner age ( all miners ) was similar in both ( Table 1 ) . </p> In addition to the increased prevalence of overall CWP , significantly elevated age-adjusted risk ratios were associated with other outcomes , including a higher prevalence of advanced disease ( small opacity profusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 3.9 , 16.9 ) , PMF ( RR = 10.5 ; 95% CI = 3.8 , 29.1 ) and r-type opacities ( RR = 7.7 ; 95% CI = 3.8 , 15.4 ) in Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia than in the 12 other states . </p> FIGURE 1-Prevalence of coal workers ' pneumoconiosis by state , sorted by prevalence : Enhanced Coal Workers ' Health Surveillance Program , 2005-2009 . </p> Mine Size We noted a decreasing trend in CWP prevalence as mine size increased ( Figure 2 ) . However , the effect of mine size was confounded with region because the distribution of mine size differed between regions . For example , Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia had significantly more mines with fewer than 100 employees ( 46.7% ) than did the 12 other coal mining states ( 15.1% ; P&lt;.001 ) . </p> We stratified the outcomes by region ( Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia or the 12 other states ) , which showed that the prevalences of CWP , PMF , r-type opacities , and small opacity profusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West Virginia were significantly associated with smaller mines , although not in a linear fashion . For example , the prevalences of r-type opacities and small opacity profusions of category 2 or higher were similar in mines with fewer than 40 miners , mines with 45-78 miners , and mines with 79-155 miners , but not in mines with more than 155 employees ( Table 2 ) . Small numbers of miners prevented a full analysis of all outcomes in the 12 other states , but the evidence showed a greater risk of overall CWP for miners in smaller mines ( RR = 6.8 ; 95% CI = 3.3 , 14.1 ) . </p> TABLE : TABLE 1-US Coal Workers ' Pneumoconiosis by Region : Enhanced Coal Workers ' Health Surveillance Program , 2005-2009 </p> Region Total No .

Miners working in the larger mines ( &gt; 155 miners ) were slightly older ( median age = 51 years ; median tenure = 24 years ) than miners from smaller mines ( ? 155 miners ; median age = 48 years ; median tenure = 23 years ) . The median tenure of miners with CWP was equivalent among those mining in Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia , but it was not equivalent with that of miners in the 12 other states ( 30 years ) . However , miners with CWP in Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia were younger ( median age = 52 years ) than miners in the other states ( median age = 55 years ; P = .01 ) , although overall the age of the workforce in the 2 regions was the same ( both median ages = 50 years ) . </p> DISCUSSION We present an updated picture of pneumoconiosis prevalence and severity in US underground coal miners as documented through active radiographic surveillance using a mobile examination unit stationed at or near working mines . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIOSH-administered Coal Workers ' X-ray Surveillance Program . Our findings have confirmed recent reports that the prevalence and severity of pneumoconiosis is higher among miners in Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia than among miners in other parts of the United States. 1 3 4 10-12 </p> Irrespective of mining region , CWP is also more prevalent and severe among workers from smaller underground mines than among those from larger mines. 5 </p> Although mine size is associated with disease incidence , size per se is not the issue ; rather , the issue is factors associated with size . Small mine size brings with it the potential for limited knowledge of , and resources for , dust reduction and disease elimination . Although larger mines can employ trained industrial hygienists and purchase state-of-the-art dust suppression measures , small mines may not have such opportunities . </p> The ECWHSP results have shown that not only is the disease burden greater in smaller mines , but also miners with CWP in smaller mines are younger than those in larger mines . Similarly , in some regions of the country , disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding that is not unique to NIOSH radiographic surveillance . Wade et al. 13 examined state compensation data between 2000 and 2009 and found that among compensated West Virginia miners , the average age at which PMF was recognized was younger than 53 years . In that study , PMF was observed in miners as young as 40 years . Given miners would have to have begun developing PMF at a younger age than when it was first identified , these findings are of great concern and demonstrate the need for further research to determine the causes . </p> Strengths and Limitations Our results have several strengths and limitations . Among the strengths are that the data were collected by a dedicated group of trained personnel in a single mobile examination unit using uniform equipment and procedures throughout the study period . All radiographs were interpreted by a minimum of 2 B Readers . All data were quality checked at the time of acquisition and verified by means of double data entry . Because participation in the monitoring program is voluntary , potential bias is a concern if those with radiographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in the medical surveys . However , we are unaware of any evidence of differential participation between those with and those without radiographic evidence of pneumoconiosis . Meaningful differential participation by disease status seems unlikely : Recruitment efforts were directed at all miners , regardless of disease status . Moreover , miners are probably unaware that they have pneumoconiosis , at least in the less severe stages of the disease , because it often presents without symptoms . </p> TABLE : TABLE 2-Prevalence of US Coal Workers ' Pneumoconiosis and Progressive Massive Fibrosis and Indicators of Severity by Region and Mine Size : Enhanced Coal Workers ' Health Surveillance Program , 2005-2009 </p> KY , VA , and WV : Sample Size ( n = 3521 ) , No .

##4119665 CPD </p> Employees who suffer from anxiety-driven panic attacks will require extra support in the workplace . Lisa du Plessis and Walter Brennan outline a case study that describes the type of help available and the involvement of occupational health in the treatment process . </p> When cable fitter John Jenkins had his first panic attack , he immediately thought that he was dying . Without any kind of warning , he developed pains in his chest and he could not breathe . He was working alone that day and quickly threw his tools into his van and was at the accident and emergency ( A &E); department within minutes . Investigations showed that Jenkins ' heart was fine ; he was medically sound . </p> However , when he had his second panic attack four days later , he was in the middle of a meeting with six colleagues . Again , he experienced chest pains , sweating and his whole body began to shake . He abruptly left the meeting and locked himself in the toilet for 15 minutes , before getting a taxi to A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack and was adamant that the hospital had got its diagnosis of " panic and stress " totally wrong . </p> His supervisor had taken note of Jenkins ' behaviour and when he asked him if he was ok , Jenkins put on an act and claimed that he was desperate for the bathroom and that he was feeling absolutely great . </p> The next day , Jenkins had his worst panic attack , while installing some cable in a trench in the middle of a busy shopping area . He was left gasping for breath and needed two of his colleagues to lift him out of the trench and lay him on the floor . An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital once again . More exhaustive testing showed no physical pathology . However , he was becoming anxious , which was represented by : difficulty concentrating ; agitation ; frequent urination ; avoidance of meetings and colleagues ; loss of appetite ; irritability ; and insomnia . </p> Jenkins had always been a worrier ; even as a child he could recall worrying about his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared that danger was just around every corner . </p> He visited his GP , who asked him if he was experiencing any difficulties at home or at work , or if he was feeling stressed about any other matters . Jenkins explained that his job was always stressful and challenging , but he had always been able to cope with the pressure as he had worked for the company for almost 20 years . His GP diagnosed panic attacks and stress , offered him a prescription of oral medication for benzodiazepines and recommended that he come and see the counsellor based at the practice . </p> Both were refused by Jenkins and he continued to work . However , his colleagues began to notice that he had gone from being cheerful and funny to serious and barely communicative . Jenkins ' supervisor called him into his office to discuss his welfare and performance . Jenkins again put on an act of denying any problems before finally breaking down and weeping . He told his supervisor that he was convinced he was either about to die or go completely mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manager would tell his colleagues about his " breakdown " and that he would be labelled a " nutter " . </p> Jenkins ' supervisor reassured him that nobody would hear anything about this from him and that he was n't the only member of the team to experience emotional distress . </p> Jenkins found this information comforting . He was advised to visit the comapny 's occupational health adviser ( OHA ) . </p> Reluctantly , he met with the OHA , who explained how the occupational health department worked and that the service was ultimately about making him feel better and working well again . </p> Psychoanalysis As part of an overall assessment , the OHA conducted brief anxiety and depression questionnaires , known as psychometrics . </p> The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire . The PHQ-9 is a powerful tool for assisting primary-care clinicians in diagnosing depression , as well as selecting and monitoring treatment . </p> Jenkins made it clear that he would not take any medication and that he did not want to go off sick , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably be sacked . </p> The OHA emphasised that mental health issues are far more common than many people believe and that the company was very much aware of how important employee wellbeing - both physical and emotional - is to the company . </p> Jenkins was asked by the OHA if he knew anything about cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) . He admitted that he did not ; he also stated that he did not like the sound of it . The OHA gave Jenkins a brief outline of CBT . He then made a referral to a qualified cognitive behavioural psychotherapist approved by the company . </p> Jenkins was offered 10 sessions of cognitive behavioural psychotherapy and was diagnosed by the psychotherapist with panic disorder without agoraphobia . </p> What is panic disorder , with or without agoraphobia Panic disorder remains a major health problem and is associated with high levels of disability and medical care , compounded by difficulties accessing appropriate treatment ( Craske and Barlow , 2006 ) . </p> Initially called agoraphobia with panic attacks and later renamed panic disorder ( PD ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PD is one of the most researched anxiety disorders due to its high rate of lifetime prevalence ( about 5.1% of adults in the US ; anecdotally , this figure is estimated to be around 4% in the UK ) . </p> In order to be diagnosed with PD , a patient must have suffered recurrent and unexpected panic attacks over a minimum period of one month , followed by persistent concern about having additional attacks . Panic attacks are commonly accompanied by uncontrollable fear , worry about the implications of the attacks ( eg losing control or having a heart attack ) , or a significant change in behaviour relating to these symptoms . </p> Many people with the disorder attend A &E; believing that they have heart problems . According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) : " For people who present with chest pain at A &E; services , there appears to be a greater likelihood of the cause being panic disorder if coronary artery disease is not present or the patient is female or relatively young " ( NICE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the major orientations of psychotherapy ( Roth et al , 2005 ) and represents a unique category of psychological intervention because it derives from cognitive and behavioural psychological models of human behaviour that include , for instance , theories of normal and abnormal development , and theories of emotion and psychopathology . </p> Cognitive therapy is based on the clinical application of the more recent , but now also extensive , research into the prominent role of cognitions in the development of emotional disorders . </p> The approach usually focuses on difficulties in the here and now , and relies on the therapist and client developing a shared view of the individual 's problem . </p> This leads to identification of personalised , usually time-limited , therapy goals and strategies , which are continually monitored and evaluated . </p> The treatments are inherently empowering in nature , the outcome being to focus on specific psychological and practical skills ( eg reflecting on and exploring the meaning attributed to events and situations and re-evaluation of those meanings ) that are aimed at enabling the client to tackle their problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilisation of such skills is seen as the main goal , and the active component in promoting change with an emphasis on putting what has been learned into practice between sessions ( " homework " ) . </p> Thus , the overall aim is for the individual to attribute improvement in their problems to their own efforts , in collaboration with the psychotherapist . Cognitive and/or behavioural psychotherapists work with individuals , families and groups . </p> Patient details and referral Jenkins is a 40-year-old married man with a 17-year-old son and works full time as a cable fitter for a large telecommunications company . The referrer reported that Jenkins had recently experienced panic attacks while at work and this was impairing his psychological wellbeing and occupational functioning . </p> Presenting problems of the patient Jenkins reported that he was experiencing symptoms of panic attacks , anxiety and worry , which he felt were spontaneous and started four to six weeks earlier . </p> Broad cognitive behavioural assessment and mental state examination Jenkins ' assessment and formulation of his problems took place over two appointment sessions . He attended the psychotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview and self-report questionnaires . </p> The assessment and examination considered issues such as initial observations about Jenkins and his environment , including the relationship with his family and colleagues . </p> His " affect " ( mood ) was assessed along with how his anxiety physiologically affected him , including feelings of muscle tension , headaches and tingling in his fingers . </p> The behavioural component of his condition meant that Jenkins was worrying excessively ; he would not work alone in case he had another attack and he kept seeking reassurance from his colleagues and his wife when anxiety symptoms increased . </p> An assessment of Jenkins ' cognition showed good attention and concentration during both assessment and treatment , though he made statement such as : " If I do n't worry , something bad might happen to my son . " </p> Treatment component Jenkins attended 10 sessions of CBT and completed the full course . </p> * Session one </p> This included setting specific treatment goals ( these should be specific goals that can be measured ) and formulating Jenkins ' problem in a cognitive behavioural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </p> * Regulate sleep pattern - sleep from around 11pm until 7am , with less than one hour of wakeful periods in the night . * Achieve a healthy lifestyle , ie eating and exercise - attend the gym three times per week on the way to work and eat less fatty/ high-calorie foods . * Socialise with friends without worrying about son and experiencing an anxiety rating of 3/10 or less . * Reduce/stop panic attacks . * Reduce worrying to no more than 30 minutes daily . * Feel happier - rate mood as at least 6/10 four days per week . * Stop seeking reassurance for panic/anxiety symptoms ( no attending hospital or asking his wife/ colleagues for reassurance when feeling anxious ) . * Attend and engage in work meetings with an anxiety rating of no more than 3/10. * Attend lone-worker jobs and complete with an anxiety rating of no more than 3/10 . Clark 's model of panic ( Clark , 1986 ) was used to diagnose Jenkins ' problem . </p> * Session two </p> This involved socialisation to the CBT model and psycho-education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educate the client and help them gain an understanding about how CBT actually works and treats problems . It is also where the client is made aware that homework will be given at each session and how CBT is collaborative . Psychological education was focused around panic disorder , how it develops and why is does not go away . It is very important to revisit the formulation to highlight what behaviours and thoughts maintain the problem . Jenkins became aware that he had a fear of fear . A diary was introduced for Jenkins to record panic symptoms . </p> * Session three </p> This session focused on anxiety management . It is important that when treating panic disorder , Jenkins should really understand how the survival/fight/flight response works . </p> It is a lesson in human biology relating to the client 's problems . This helps with misinterpretation of anxiety symptoms that are a key factor in panic disorder . Jenkins was able to see how his body was preparing to run or fight as he prepared for what he thought was a dangerous situation . </p> * Session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a behaviour technique used in CBT . It refers to carrying out exercises that bring about the physical sensations of a panic attack , such as hyperventilation and high muscle tension . </p> This was effective in provoking a wide range of panic-like sensations , such as dizziness , feeling hot , increased heart rate , tightness in the chest and visual changes . It was useful to challenge misinterpretations of these sensations , such as heart attack or fainting , and for building tolerance of anxious feelings . </p> * Sessions five to seven </p> In these sessions of relaxation and exposure , Jenkins was taught how to utilise a relaxation technique called progressive muscle relaxation , where specific muscle groups are tensed and relaxed . </p> * Sessions eight to nine </p> In these cognitive restructuring sessions , Jenkins was educated about thoughts/beliefs and thinking and how this affected his behaviour and mood . Within the session , unhelpful thinking habits ( cognitive distortions ) were reviewed . This enabled the identification of several of these habits that Jenkins experienced on a regular basis . </p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relapse by identifying the helpful changes that he made during therapy in all areas ( thoughts , feeling , behaviours , physical sensations and relationships ) . It also identified signs of relapse and what to do to prevent symptoms returning or how to treat Jenkins ' symptoms quickly , similar to an action plan of what to do . </p> Conclusion Jenkins was initially resistant to CBT and often the first five minutes of each session would be about restoring his belief in the treatment . Eventually , his gradual improvement enabled him to meet his treatment goals and his psychometric scores reached sub-clinical levels . </p> The occupational health team at Jenkins ' company supported him as he gradually returned to work over a three-month period . </p> One of the most important areas of growth for Jenkins was the knowledge and confidence that while anxiety could not be prevented , it could now be understood and managed . </p> The OHA trained to deliver the Mental Wealth Programme ( Brennan , 2005 ) and introduced it as a general mental wellbeing option for employees within the company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff feeling well mentally . </p> Jenkins was able to return to all of his duties after six months and continued to utilise the skills acquired as part of his homework during CBT . </p> His employers also ran a training course on the Health and Safety Executives six Management Standards ( Health and Safety Executive , 2004 ) for dealing with stress for managers and supervisors . </p> Author note : the name and occupation of the case-study subject have been changed . </p> CPD Continuing Professional Development Study Time 3hrs* </p> Our learning for life service helps you use the journal for CPD-related private study .

##4119666 Postsecondary Education </p> Using the Summary of Performance to Enhance Transition Planning The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act requires that local education agencies provide a transition summary document to all special education students who graduate with a regular diploma or reach the maximum age for services . Although state compliance with this requirement is almost universal , is this process being used effectively to enhance postschool outcomes for students with disabilities ? There is an array of practices that school district and state education agency personnel can implement to make this document more helpful to students , bridging the " documentation disconnect " between secondary school and postsecondary education and employment , enhancing self-determination skills , and fostering improved adult success . </p> When students with disabilities transition to postsecondary environments , such as education or employment , they move from the mandates of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA , 2006 ) to the protections of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ( ADAAA , 2009 ) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( Section 504 , 2006 ) . To receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Section 504 require that an individual document the existence of a disability that substantially limits a major life function . Postsecondary programs and employers can -- and do -- set varying standards in relation to the comprehensiveness and the recency of this documentation . Traditionally , such documentation has comprised evaluations conducted as part of the special education eligibility determination and updates as required under the IDEA . </p> However , IDEA regulations do not require routine testing and evaluation . If the individualized education program ( IEP ) team determines that " no additional data are needed to determine whether the child continues to be a child with a disability , and to determine the child 's educational needs " ( 34 C.F.R. 300.305 d1 ) , formal assessments for reevaluation may be deemed unnecessary . Recently , there has been increasing focus on the use of informal assessments ( e.g. , response to intervention , curriculum-based assessment ) , limiting the use of traditional psychoeducational evaluations . In addition , IDEA clearly indicates that an " exit evaluation " for students leaving high school is not required ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2011 ) . These changes may result in students transitioning to postsecondary programs with outdated documentation of their disability , which may negatively impact their eligibility for services and accommodations in postsecondary environments . </p> However , IDEA does offer the local education agency ( LEA ) a potentially powerful tool to help students bridge this gap as they shift from secondary to postsecondary environments : the summary of performance ( SOP ) . IDEA requires LEAs to develop a summary statement of " academic achievement and functional performance " for students with disabilities who are exiting special education due to graduation or reaching the maximum age of eligibility for services , and this statement must include " recommendations on how to assist the child in meeting the child 's postsecondary goals ( 34 CFR 300.305e 3 ) ) . This type of information is particularly important because psychoeducational evaluations do not address postsecondary expectations . Although this legislation specifies minimum requirements , it is critical that teachers , families , agencies , and most importantly the students , work collaboratively to create a comprehensive SOP that will lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the substantive details of the SOP to states and local school districts , and there are significant variations in how states and districts operationalize the SOP . Despite these variations , the true spirit of these tools must both reflect best practice and meet the needs of students with disabilities and their families to ensure a successful transition . </p> Current Status of SOP Implementation The National Association of State Directors of Special Education published a policy analysis on state education agency ( SEA ) response to the SOP ( Sopko , 2008 ) . The study found that 30 SEAs had developed an SOP form , but not all required LEAs to use their form . ( The study did not detail the contents of the form created by the states . ) Madaus et al . ( 2011 ) recently reviewed SEA web sites to identify the elements included in each state 's SOP form . Of the 43 state forms examined , 88% were in compliance with the three core SOP requirements specified in IDEA 2004 ( i.e. , a statement of academic achievement , a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student meet postsecondary goals ) . Although this data is generally encouraging , it is unfortunate that seven of the states did not have SOP forms that met the minimum requirements of IDEA -- and only about half of the states ' SOPs could be described as comprehensive . In addition , both Sopko ( 2008 ) and Madaus et al . ( 2011 ) have noted that many states are not mandating LEAs to use the state-approved form . This raises questions about the utility of the SOPs being used in districts and schools throughout the country . </p> Precisely because the IDEA regulations do not specify what should be included in an SOP , the National Transition Assessment Summit ( NTAS ) was convened in 200S . This group included representatives from many national disability organizations including secondary , postsecondary , state departments of education , local education agency personnel , and consumers . NTAS developed a model SOP intended to direct the field toward best practice for this document ( NTAS , 2005 ; Shaw , Madaus , &; Dukes , 2010 ) . The Nationally Ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been endorsed by the Council for Exceptional Children ( CEC ) , several of its divisions , and other national organizations such as the Council for Learning Disabilities , the Higher Education Consortium for Special Education , and the Learning Disability Association of America . NTAS encouraged SEAs and LEAs to adopt the template or adapt it to meet their specific needs . Madaus and colleagues ' ( 2011 ) recent analysis of 43 states revealed 21% of the states have adopted the NTAS model SOP template and attributed their form to this source ; 40% of the states fulfill the NTAS template guidelines such as attaching disability documentation . </p> The U.S. Department of Education , in the regulatory comments accompanying the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA , noted that state and local officials should have the flexibility to determine appropriate content for a student 's summary , which must be based on the student 's individual needs and postsecondary goals ( 34 C.F.R. Sec. 300.305e 3 ) . However , this flexibility must be balanced with the need to assure that students with disabilities , upon leaving high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes . States or districts that do not employ a comprehensive SOP should consider reviewing and implementing model forms from other states or districts ( see box , " SOP Resources " ) . </p> Implementing and Developing the SOP Although not stated in the IDEA regulations , it is recommended that the SOP be the responsibility of the IEP team , just as are other transition planning components ( NTAS , 2005 ) . The IEP team should determine who should be involved in developing the initial SOP draft , set a timeline for completion , and approve the final SOP . Although the SOP may be the culminating event in the student 's transition process , it can also be developed over time with meaningful input from the student . </p> If the SOP is developed as an element of transition planning across time , consider the following recommendations : </p> * Review the SOP at regular intervals with the student ( e.g. , during annual IEP review ) to foster an understanding of progress over time and future transition needs to be addressed . </p> * Develop an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary transition assessment data -- and develop a timeline for accumulating this information . If the contents of the portfolio are transferred annually to a working SOP , it promotes integration and use of the results . </p> * Whenever possible , have the student lead the SOP discussion during transition IEP meetings to further promote self-determination . </p> * Involve various stakeholders ( e.g. , student , family , special and general educators , school psychologist , school counselors ) in developing the SOP to promote a team approach . </p> Madaus et al . ( 2011 ) reported that many LEAs have implemented productive approaches to distributing the SOP to students . Some have formal exit interviews where the contents of the SOP are discussed and the document is given to the student . Others give the SOP to the student at a face-to-face meeting or send it by mail . Regardless of how this is accomplished , it is critical that the SOP process involve the student . </p> The Importance of the SOP The SOP should be viewed as a critical step in a student 's transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in compliance with IDEA . A well-constructed and thorough SOP can serve as a teaching tool that provides students with an opportunity to practice self-determination and to develop an awareness of their disability , strengths , and needs ( Shaw , 2009 ) . It can be part of a deliberate and comprehensive transition plan that is initiated with a determination of the student 's postsecondary goals which are delineated from and based upon age-appropriate transition assessments , as mandated by IDEA . The student 's secondary curriculum and transition plan should then be targeted toward reaching these goals . Ongoing data collection , both formal and informal , helps to measure progress toward meeting postsecondary goals , and it is precisely this data that provides the foundation upon which the SOP is developed ( Madaus &; Shaw , 2007 ) . </p> The SOP addresses two audiences . The first is the student ; the SOP can serve as a tool that students use to help access postsecondary supports under the ADAAA and Section 504 . To enhance the value of the SOP in this regard , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable , and useable document that facilitates successful postschool student outcomes in terms of employment and/or postsecondary education . It should describe strengths , skills , needs , and strategy use in language that promotes the provision of appropriate postschool accommodations . In order to capitalize on the potential use of the document as a student-led tool , the narrative should be written in positive , person-centered language . Students , in collaboration with secondary professionals , can begin preparing the SOP during their first year of high school and update it every year , so that the SOP becomes part of a student-driven transition portfolio . Alternatively , the SOP can be used as a senior-year capstone experience in which the student participates in its completion as part of a graduation project . Self-determination should play a central role in whatever SOP approach is chosen . Self-determination can be reflected in the process by having the student focus on meaningful postsecondary goals , reinforcing student knowledge of the disability , its impact on performance as well as strengths , and involving the student in identifying accommodations that have improved school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a potential second audience for the SOP . A well-constructed and comprehensive SOP can provide postsecondary professionals with current , comprehensive , and meaningful information about the student 's strengths and potential accommodations required ( Madaus &; Shaw , 2007 ) . The ADAAA has changed the emphasis in postsecondary disability documentation from a determination of disability status to a focus on the need for supports and accommodations based on the functional impact of the disability . An SOP that indicates what accommodations , compensatory services , and supports have been effective to ameliorate deficits will be particularly useful to postsecondary education disability personnel and employers ( Shaw , Keenan , Madaus , &; Banerjee , 2010 ) . More important , by effectively implementing this mandate , school personnel will address critical accountability issues related to employment and postsecondary education outcomes ( Shaw , Madaus et al. , 2010 ) . At the postsecondary level , the student alone is responsible for self-identification as someone with a disability , presenting documentation to support that claim and requesting postschool accommodations from employers or education personnel . A comprehensive SOP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOP Part 1 : Background Information The first section of the SOP , following the NTAS model SOP template ( see Table 1 ) , should include the student 's demographic information , identified disability , and date of diagnosis . The most recent evaluation data should be attached to the completed SOP ; this is particularly important for students going on to college . The institution 's disability services office may require evaluation data to determine eligibility under ADAAA ( Dukes , 2010 ) . </p> Part 2 : Student 's Postsecondary Goals Students and their families should lead the determination of postsecondary goals and dictate what information will be highlighted in sections of the SOP . By law , the goals should address education or training , employment , and independent living as appropriate ( Kochhar-Bryant &; Izzo , 2006 ) . The goals included in Part 2 of the SOP are a reflection of the measurable postsecondary goals the student and family articulated during the IEP transition assessment process ( Dukes , 2010 ) . </p> Part 3 : Summary of Performance This section is designed to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional skills . It is critical that this section of the SOP highlight the student 's strengths , needs , preferences , and interests . An SOP that merely repeats the test scores that are included on the attached disability documentation loses a valuable opportunity to explain the student 's strengths and needs . Data included in this section of the SOP should reflect the postsecondary goals previously specified . For example , if the student and family have indicated employment as a goal , then the vocational , employment , and career areas become particularly important , as well as social , environmental access , and mobility areas . A wide array of formal and informal data sources should be used in Part 3 to highlight the student 's strengths and needs . </p> Part 4 : Recommendations to Assist the Student in Meeting Postsecondary Goals This section highlights suggestions for accommodations , adaptive devices , assistive services , compensatory strategies , or support services for the purpose of enhancing access to postsecondary education or employment . Be especially careful when completing this section . Employers and postsecondary institutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and students and families need to be aware that the suggested accommodations and supports are only recommendations . Postsecondary agencies make independent decisions based on situation-specific variables in their respective settings ( i.e. , speed is not an issue for that job so extended time is not needed , or a different accommodation is being used to ameliorate that deficit ) . </p> Part 5 : Student Input Encouraging students to participate in developing the SOP can foster understanding of their disability and their need for supports and accommodations . It also promotes self-determination as we specifically seek to " hear " the student 's voice in the development of the SOP document . Given that self-determination is associated with success in both employment ( Wehmeyer &; Palmer , 2003 ) and postsecondary education ( Field , Sarver , &; Shaw , 2003 ) , this is a vital part of the SOP process . Remember , it is the student 's responsibility to communicate needs to service providers in post high school settings . Postsecondary personnel will be particularly interested in the student 's perspective given that he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of contact when requesting postschool supports . </p> Final Thoughts The SOP is designed to apply to students with a range of disabilities transitioning to diverse postsecondary environments . In some cases , the data included will be curriculum-based , and supplemented with formal evaluations . In other cases , the opposite may be true . For example , for students transitioning to higher education , the Part 3 summary of academic and cognitive skills may be the most important portion of the document . For those seeking employment , consideration of the vocational , social , and independent living skills categories in that same section may be the most critical in the transition to adult life . This information has often not been available in traditional psychoeducational evaluations . </p> A comprehensive SOP is not a new set of evaluations and assessment data ; it is a summary of existing data and of performance in academic and functional areas ( Madaus , Bigaj , Chafouleas , &; Simonsen , 2006 ) . The SOP offers students , in collaboration with high school professionals , the opportunity to summarize current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have assisted the student in the secondary environment . This discussion of accommodations and modifications should focus on those that have been used effectively . A comprehensive SOP with this sort of information will provide both employers and service providers in postsecondary institutions insight into the student 's present level of performance and functional limitations that can be used to promote postschool success . </p> Summary of Performance ( SOP ) Resources * The U.S. Department of Education 's IDEA web site includes a questions-and-answers page related to secondary transition , with information specifically about the SOP .
