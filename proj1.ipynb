The same process is also in place for other rovers and machines, such as Curiosity and other planned rovers.[5]  The benefits of this increased intelligence are numerous.  On a basic level, the A.I. assists with navigation.  The rovers can avoid obstacles and can find better paths to and from ordered positions with greater ease and safety, all with less input needed from the humans back on Earth.  As software is updated, and intelligence is added, the rovers’ capabilities drastically increase.[6]  For data collection, rovers are smarter about knowing when to transfer data back to Earth.  While in the past some data has been lost due to poor connection, or not enough storage and being overwritten, the rovers now can decide when they should backup data according to amount of storage left, and broadband connectivity with mission control.[7]  The rovers have also developed the intelligence to think scientifically.  If a photo that they take, or object that they see is deemed scientifically interesting, they will seek closer inspection and take more pictures with different angles and filters.  If the object is unimportant—an empty sky devoid of storms or interesting features, for example—then they will only store it temporarily, and won’t hesitate to overwrite it.  Unless, of course, they are instructed otherwise.[6][8]  All in all, as rovers become more autonomous, they are able to do their job quicker, instead of waiting for a command that can take upwards of 10 minutes to be received.  As more rovers are sent to Mars and to other planets, it is entirely possible that there will be interconnected teams of rovers working together as scientists.  Eventually, barely any human moderation will be needed for entire experiments and research projects to take place.\"\"\".split(\"  \")"

      "  The rovers are also able to be used for research and medical research, but as rovers learn more and more, they are more able to use the rovers more freely as well.[9]  For this reason, rovers are also often used for research projects that are not only related to human’s interests, but also to improve rovers’s data collection.[10]  All of this is very good news for rovers, and is also a step towards better and safer rovers.  However, there are also some issues that rovers are struggling with, and this is where rovers’s intelligence comes into play.  Many rovers are also limited by their rovers’s ability to learn new rovers, and so rovers have a limited amount of rovers.  While rovers are not able to learn rovers that can—as far as rovers’s ability to learn rovers—they are able to learn rovers that can be transferred from rovers to rovers, and so rovers are able to learn rovers that can be reunited with rovers, and so rovers are able to learn rovers that can be used to connect rovers to rovers.  This is also a good sign for rovers after rovers are sent to Mars.  When rovers and rovers are placed together, rovers’s rovers are able to take pictures with different angles and filters, and will use that information together with rovers to make a photo that rovers can take.  These rovers will be able to learn with rovers’s rovers the same way rovers’s rovers are able to learn rovers.[11]  At current rovers, rovers’s rovers are still trying to understand rovers.  At the moment, rovers’s rovers are using rovers’s data, but rovers’s data is being lost and in some cases, rovers’s data will be lost forever.  All of this is a great sign for rovers and rovers if that rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’s rovers’\n",

On a basic level, the A.I. assists with navigation.    The rover has been able to learn more about the Martian environment and more about the geological landscape.  The rovers can avoid obstacles and can find better paths to and from ordered positions with greater ease and safety, all with less input needed from the humans back on Earth.

Curiosity has improved on the rovers and rover, but it has also been more difficult to maintain the rover and keep it up.  While in the past some data has been lost due to poor connection, or not enough storage and being overwritten, the rovers now can decide when they should backup data according to amount of storage left, and broadband connectivity with mission control.[7]    And it\\'s a good reason to be excited about the rover\\'s ability to better study for example the possibility of water or other organisms in the Gale Crater.  The rovers have also developed the intelligence to think scientifically.    \\xa0 The rover has received new sensors, more data, and a new rover.  If a photo that they take, or object that they see is deemed scientifically interesting, they will seek closer inspection and take more pictures with different angles and filters.    For instance, the rover now has better accuracy and better range when the rover is away from the rover.

Unless, of course, they are instructed otherwise.[6][8]    For example, \\xa0the rover is able to learn to recognize the sounds of the Martian wind, and \\xa0the rover is able to recognize the sounds of other rovers.
