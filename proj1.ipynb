      "The final and arguably most accurate and important connection between Salinger’s life and the book he created is a similarity between Holden and Salinger. The two share a great interest, of which is a definite theme throughout the book, being the desire for the preservation of innocence. Throughout the book, Holden seems to be less grown up than most of the people around him. He seems to dislike many people his age or older, saying that they are all phonies. Kids on the other hand, he likes them a lot due to just how uncorrupted and innocent they are. When Holden is depressed, seeing the innocence of a kid generally makes him feel better, as seen when Holden is depressed before meeting up with Sally, but he sees a child singing “If a body catch a body coming through the rye.” and it made him feel better. It made me “feel less depressed” (p. 140) In the last line of the book, Salinger seems to be talking to himself about his life. He writes:”\"A few years ago, I stopped by your house. The air was great. The sun was almost out. I just kept seeing eyes wide open, and I was walking, and I was standing on a field, and there was this big cliff, and I had to go over it. The only thing I could do was run. I never had to run before.” (p. 140-141) The last and arguably most accurate and most important connection between Salinger”s life and the book he created is a similarity between Holden and Salinger.

The two share a great interest, of which is a definite theme throughout the book, being the desire for the preservation of innocence. Throughout the book, Holden seems to be less grown up than most of the people around him. He seems to dislike many people his age or older, saying that they are all phonies. Kids on the other hand, he likes them a lot due to just how uncorrupted and innocent they are. When Holden is depressed, seeing the innocence of a kid generally makes him feel better, as seen when Holden is depressed before meeting up with Sally, but he sees a child singing “If a body catch a body coming through the rye.” and it made him feel better.\"\"\",\n",
